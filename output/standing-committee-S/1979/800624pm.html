	<time>Tuesday 24th June 1980</time>
	<p>(	<i>Afternoon</i>)</p>
	<p>[MR. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) It shall be an offence to supply, as part of a commercial transaction, solvents or similar substances which may be inhaled to any person under the age of sixteen years;
	<ol>
	<li>Any person convicted of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500;</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State shall make regulations defining the substances referred to in subsection (1) above, which regulations shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>this day</i>], That the clause be read a Second time.—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following new clauses:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 7—	<i>Glue-sniffing.</i></p>
	<p>No. 12—	<i>Supplying substances for inhaling.</i></p>
	<p>No. 15—	<i>Restrictions on sale of certain solvents.</i></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch, I was addressing myself to the various difficulties, as I see them, in the new clauses. Turning to new clause 12, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), he understands that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be an offence to supply, whether or not as part of a commercial transaction,"</p></blockquote>
would catch members of the family. That may be his intention, and it may be an inevitable intention, because there is no point in stopping the water in one place if it is to flow through a hole in another. We must look seriously at that. But it is the next words that really create the difficulty:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to any person solvent or similar substance".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1536</span>
It is suggested that the Secretary of State would have to define those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the opportunity, while listening to the Prime Minister, to ask the Clerk in the Chamber if I might borrow his tub of Gripfix which I noticed before him. I observed that that contains a solvent which would be intoxicant if sniffed. If anything as 	<i>vin ordinaire,</i> ancient and simple as Gripfix which—I do not know about octogenarians such as the hon Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), but for septuagenarians such as I am—was certainly on the go when we were children, is one of the sources of criminality, we must realise what a difficult matter this is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which the supplier has reasonable cause to believe will be inhaled."</p></blockquote>
That, as it is framed, would be for the Crown to prove. On what possible basis can it be said that tube No. 1—to use my hon. Friend's own example—of "Stickit" will not be inhaled, or that it is not reasonable to suppose that it will be inhaled? If the shopkeeper in his example finds that the sale of "Stickit" goes up from 13 tubes a week to 32, what reasonable assumption does he make? Does he assume that tubes Nos. 14 to 32 will be inhaled where Nos. 1 to 13 are not? It puts an impossible burden of proof on the shopkeeper. Equally, if the supposition is reversed, and it is said that the onus is on the shopkeeper to say how he knew that it would not be inhaled, it puts an impossible burden of responsibility on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I agree that if a shop in a housing scheme or district markets a product that it wickedly knows will be sniffed, that is one problem. However, I regret to say that the major outlets for these products are department stores, in which most goods are picked up and paid for at the cash desk. Has the little girl in Woolworths or Littlewoods to ask herself, when she is selling an aerosol paint spray, a tube of glue, a packet of shoe polish or some Brasso, "Have I reasonable cause to believe that this will be inhaled?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, one of the major sources, oddly enough, of inhaled substances is shoplifting. A large amount is stolen. It is a very difficult problem indeed. I can see no legal criterion for the concept
	<br><blockquote><p>"has reasonable cause to believe will be inhaled."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1537</span>
It will deal with such a minute fraction of solvents. The little corner shop, mentioned by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), might deal with Mr. Malik, who is presumed to be innocent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Be careful. The hon. and learned Gentleman has done enough damage in the last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but we would find that almost every prosecution would trip on the impossibility of that hurdle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the fact that the Crown Office allowed the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow to pursue the Malik case and take it to court, suggests that it thought that it could be proved that he had supplied those materials wilfully and knowingly and so on, 1 suggest to my hon. and learned Friend that, if the Crown Office thought so in that case, it may be worth pursuing in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstances of that case were very special and certainly eccentric to the general source of substances which are inhaled. As it turned out, we failed. The problem is to find a formula which has the essential characteristics of common law; one has to establish 	<i>culpa</i> and 	<i>mens rea.</i> That is the only way that we could find a solution to make this an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me finish with a caution. It makes what I have said admissible. There was another suggestion which we canvassed in the last debate. That was the question of giving publicity by labelling substances as inhalants. Those who considered that matter realised that, because it is a craze, one is infinitely more likely to promote the concept of daring, the knowledge that it is done, the effect that it will have and from what substance that effect can be obtained if the fact is publicised on Brasso, Gripfix, shoe polish, and so on. It is a difficult dilemma, but I very much hope that those who report this debate and those who discuss the whole subject will remember that advertisements which say "Do not sniff substances—they are harmful to your health" are, in the belief of all those who have considered the matter, infinitely more likely to attract people to do it because there is a great attraction for young people to do things that are forbidden. However,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1538</span>
that is not a reason not to forbid things. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am obliged that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire West (Mr. Buchan) appreciates that I am still a teenager—in age. But there is that attraction and it is a very difficult subject. Sniffing is a craze at a certain age and, normally, it is a group activity. They are really seeking for a way of removing themselves from responsibility and having a kick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear where my hon. and learned Friend stands. Is he saying that in his view Parliament is impotent, or that Parliament is potent only in so far as being able to produce an unworkable law? Or is he saying that the law is better left out of this problem altogether? Reverting to what he said to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), surely his argument about the difficulties of proof applies with equal force to the common law crime of reset. Reasonable cause to believe that goods have been stolen can, none the less, be a criterion that is satisfied by proof of the circumstances, and I wonder whether that is not a parallel on which we can build in trying to find legislative means to deal with this vexing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). He put the matter very succinctly, except in his analogy of the reset. The analogy unfortunately falls down on the basis that in reset there is no argument that the goods are stolen. We start from the fact that the goods are stolen. In this situation, we do not start from the fact that the goods are forbidden goods. They are forbidden goods only in the circumstances in which they are to be used improperly. If reset were a crime in which to receive stolen goods which one proposed to sell was an offence, but not to receive it in any other ordinary circumstances, that would be a closer analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start in reset from a completely different concept, that one is in possession of stolen goods, whereas the Clerk at the Table of the House of Commons with his Gripfix, my daughter cleaning her buttons with Brasso and the hon. Member for Garscadden's child making his aeroplane, are doing something legitimate. They are not in possession of an illegal object. It is the use to which they put the object that is the distinction from reset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1539</span>
I should prefer to reserve my answer to the questions whether Parliament is impotent, whether it can produce legislation—whether this Committee can produce a useful legislative formula—or whether we should attempt to deal with the matter only by the measures that I have already described, until I have heard whatever other members of the Committee wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks which, clearly, have a quite serious impact on the new clauses. I cannot say what will happen in that respect but initially I had intended to speak in support of new clause 15, because I thought that it offered the most practical means of dealing with the problem. This is a very serious problem and I hope that it will still be possible to find a formula, so that we can stop or discourage the sale of these items to young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, it was following the death of a 14 year old boy that Strathclyde social work department asked for glue sniffing to be grounds of referral to the children's panel reporter. I certainly support the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in his new clause and I believe that we should continue to examine ways in which the law may be strengthened so as to prevent the retailing of these items to children. Several Members of Parliament have been publicly identified with that objective. Both my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), have a strong public record of fighting for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to those of us who are in touch with social workers—and in our own weekend surgeries—that there is considerable public opinion supporting the objectives of the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glue sniffing is a misnomer. Dr. Joyce Watson—who is an authority in the field, and who researched the phenomenon in Strathclyde between 1974 and 1975—reached two important conclusions. First, it is not the glue which is inhaled, but a vapour which is not confined to adhesives. Secondly, the vapour is not only sniffed but inhaled through the mouth. Aerosols are used in this way to spray into the nose or directly into the mouth. Sadly, this has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1540</span>
caused the sudden death of some who have engaged in it. So it is a serious and worrying thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October 1976, the British Association of Social Workers published a special report in its magazine "Social Work Today". The report listed what it described as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the ever increasing range of agents used by young people involved in the practice."</p></blockquote>
The Solicitor-General this morning detailed a number of substances which are being used. I am informed—and it is by no means an exhaustive list—that recent research has identified anti-freeze, cement, chloroform, ether, dry cleaning substances, gas lighter fuel, nail polish remover, paint thinner and stripper, and surgical spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these substances can be easily obtained and it is a sad fact that social workers, particularly in the west of Scotland and the Glasgow area, are finding that youngsters have moved on from glue and "moved into"—that is the phrase—other substances. That is a most serious development, underlined by the fact that many of the substances damage health. Some of thoese substances are used in industrial processes, where it is known that they cause liver damage and lung damage and are carcinogens. It is therefore all the more worrying that they are used in totally uncontrolled circumstances by young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My information is that, mercifully, many youngsters merely experiment with sniffing and then give it up. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) pointed out, it is not addictive. It is not like tobacco, drugs or alcohol. None the less, it is extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statistics show a rising trend between 1970 and 1975. I am concerned about that research, because simultaneously with the figures rising there has been an increasing public awareness of glue sniffing, and as it became better known it was more easily identifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can be done? The British Association of Social Workers advised professional social workers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no specific social work treatment in relation to solvent sniffing. In most cases the practice is experimental or due to peer group pressure or a symptom of some underlying personal home or psychiatric problem for which the child is already under social work supervision."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, this is a difficult area in which to legislate. Many social workers at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1541</span>
the time when this was developing were against publicity. I think I am right in saying that the events in the constituency of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) were worrying for the police involved in the community involvement scheme, in that publicity would not be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is now out in the open and we have to decide what we will do. Therefore, I think that our debate has been extremely useful in identifying these complex issues and the difficulty of legislating to meet the problem. Notwithstanding what the Solicitor-General for Scotland has said, I hope that he will find it possible to consider the matter and how a formula may best be devised in order that the availability of substances to young people can be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, even where the law may be defective in its operation in that kind of area, none the less I think that it would alert shopkeepers to the problem, would alert parents to the problem, and would alert teachers, youth workers and all those concerned with children, to the need to have safeguards. To that extent, I support the general intention behind the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not support new clause 7 because I thought that it was punitive in the wrong direction. The other new clauses had a different intent, to reduce availability and put it outside the law in relation to minors. That had, and continues to have, my support, and I hope that it will be possible to introduce that into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting debate and it has done the Committee a good deal of credit, but whether we have come up with any solutions is another matter. I was very impressed with the intervention of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock), who said that we are potent but only to the extent of bringing in a bad law, or impotent if we cannot produce a law at all, or that the matter should be left alone for other purposes. That, roughly, was the whole trend of the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always suspicious when I hear a Law Officer—or, indeed, any Minister—making it patently clear that nothing can be done. I remain unconvinced that we cannot find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reaction to the four
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1542</span>
clauses we have before us was that he regarded new clauses 6 and 12 as preventive solutions. They are the clauses of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). He regarded new clause 7 as a deterrent but only an individual deterrent. The third—the question of cure—in relation to new clause 15 was a perfect category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with new clause 7 is that it does not deal with the supply aspect There is a general conclusion within the Committee that it is a social and human problem that we are dealing with rather than a criminal problem. The fact of its becoming a criminal problem may prevent help and assistance at the time—and, for that matter, the place—when it is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some clarification here. I know a considerable amount about vending and selling this type of merchandise. I used to run a retail stores group that dealt with this type of product. I can understand the difficulties, as outlined by the Solicitor-General for Scotland, in trying to legislate to prevent sales. I understood that, so I tackled the problem from the other side. I made clear in my speech that if there were areas that were suspect I hoped the Government would look at it and come up with a solution to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. and learned Member grappled earlier with the problem that we have discovered. However, I think that his solution—to make it an individual crime rather than leaving it as a social problem or being able to deal with the supply—does not help and may make the situation worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told about easy access and bringing offenders before the children's panels. The Strathclyde experience seems to point to a more helpful situation. We are dealing with youngsters; we are not dealing with older drug addicts in possession of cannabis. Few people get done for smoking a joint, but they can get done for possessing drugs. It is on the source and access of drugs that the law operates. We should keep to that in relation to this problem, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Malik case is extremely important. It shows that the Government intend to act if they can. They did not act because they did not have sufficient legal powers and no statutory powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1543</span>
That brings me to the two crucial amendments, new clause 6 and new clause 12. From the discussion it is clear that if any clause comes close to finding a solution it is new clause 12. I am not sure whether it is so much at fault as the Solicitor-General suggested. His worry was the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"which the supplier has reasonable cause to believe will be inhaled."</p></blockquote>
He said that it would mean that it would be impossible for the innocent person to prove his innocence or for the prosecution to prove guilt. However, the prosecution remains in the hands of the Crown Office. Prosecution is not brought only because a law exists but because it is believed that in a special case action is possible. Although the law will not be able to be applied in many cases, we are concerned with situations where it can. The Malik case was presumably a case in point. If such small shops can be dealt with, that in itself will help, but it will not deal with the problem of the girl behind the counter in Woolworths. The Act will immediately create a deterrent for all shopkeepers and assistants. If we can make access difficult, that will be a help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if it is possible to bring in a law, even though it will be difficult to apply, and to bring a successful prosecution, that will bring in the secondary function of the law, which is not always to bring a prosecution but to prevent crime. The new clause might act in such a deterrent role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with new clause 12 is not the phrase I have quoted, although I agree that we shall have to look at it again, but the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not as part of a commercial transaction."</p></blockquote>
If we left it at a commercial transaction, we should be getting towards a solution that might be partially effective. It would express the Committee's wishes as guidance to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that the method of approach outlined in new clause 15 is impossible. The Solicitor-General listed the massive nature of the substances and products. One thinks of lists of food additives in the United States; the list is massive, but it is effective. We should not be dealing only with substances but with proprietary brands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Solicitor-General's comment that as soon as we list proprietary brands we are saying "Inhale me" to many youngsters. That is a problem. How-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1544</span>
ever, I should like the new clause to be looked at again—I do not mean before Report, because it will take a good deal longer than that. I recommend to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who tabled the amendment, that he should withdraw it at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to new clause 12. It seems that it comes close to something that might be effective and would begin to express the Committee's wishes. Despite his immense reservations, will the Solicitor-General look, either in consultation with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) or the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and with his own office, to see whether we can come up with something on these lines before Report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has emerged from the discussion is the harmony of view in the Committee and the realisation that we are not dealing just with a craze. It is not roller-skating, it is a dangerous craze for successive groups of 13 and 14 year olds. It is a continuing problem which has an immense effect on the health and life of some of our young people. Therefore, I ask the Minister to come back to that on Report. Perhaps he would consult with us—certainly with the two hon. Members whose clauses are involved here—to see whether we can frame something along these lines. I believe that, effective as it is on a mass scale, its very presence and effectiveness in isolated cases might be of itself a helpful deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is my usual role in the Committee, I conclude in that spirit of peace and harmony.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond in the spirit in which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has made his remarks. May I say to the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg)—and in a way to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West—that for two reasons I regard the solution of adding substances which are repulsive or repellant as infinitely the least likely line of success. First, it is necessary to say what substances the repellant will be added to, so all the substances will have to be denned. Secondly—and this is a matter which will concern the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East—if a child were to take a good sniff of a substance which had a repellant in it, such as carbon disulphide, the chances

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1545</span>
of damage to that child's lungs, liver, kidneys and brain would be infinitely greater. If he became tolerant of that frightful, stinking, awful smell—which I was led to believe was the most repulsive known to man, in order to obtain the solvent which it masked—the risks to his health would be even greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem a happy concept that one puts people off by saying that something is unpleasant, but we all know the story in the pub of someone saying "I have spat in this", in the hope that the person would not drink it. That does not work. If one wrote "poison" on things, and included poison in them, it would not have the desired effect. So I regard that as an unhopeful path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all wish to find a solution; a simple solution, a deterrent solution. The Government will look at it to try to find a suitable form of words before Report. If they do not, they will pursue their researches thereafter to find a simple answer to the problem. I say categorically that that form of words cannot and will not include an obligation on anybody to produce lists and categories of substances about which the Committee is talking. That is a fallacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) in both new clauses 6 and 12 is fallacious, but the Government will try to find a simple form of words which will make, if I may say so in rather odd language, a "legislative common law offence".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned with subsections (1) and (2) of the new clause, rather than with subsection (3). I accept much of what the Solicitor-General for Scotland says on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), we know the age group involved and that glue sniffing leads to criminal activity. That is what we need to strike at. There is no difficulty when a person under the influence of a solvent commits a criminal offence, because one can always prosecute that person. We want to try to prevent it happening. We shall certainly try to find a simple form of words which overcomes the major problems that I have outlined, one of which I have said that we shall exclude, namely, any attempt to list such substances as we regard as falling into the category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>It shall also be an offence for any person or company to pay a convicted person or to any member of his family or to any company with which such a convicted person is in any way associated any sum of money or other form of remuneration in relation to the publication of a report as described in subsection (1) above.</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is a modest one on a south-facing slope, but I hope that the sun of the Solicitor-General's smile will shine upon it and that it may bear fruit. The clause is designed to probe the present state of the law, the degree of Government commitment, and the practicability of changing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "cheque book journalism" is well known to us. The clause is not synonymous with that. Cheque book journalism can entice failing film starlets, whose lustre has already begun to dim, and who, having bared all on celluloid, now bare all between the pages of a hard-backed book, in which they can name names, dates, times and possibly, past judgments. Subject to the laws of libel and obscenity, they would still be able to do so if the new clause were accepted. They might break records, but, provided they did not break the law, the clause would not affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, politicians, too, would remain immune for its implications. For example, it would not affect heavy volumes such as those to which we were treated by the late Richard Crossman in a mixture of gossip, prejudice and self-esteem masquerading as constitutional history. Nor would it affect another of the "It could happen here" genre of particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1547</span>
alarmist factions. I refer to Baroness Castle's "Castles in the Air" or even the "cloud-capped towers" and the "gorgeous palaces" of the right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"such stuff as dreams are made on"—</p></blockquote>
which are unaffected by the clause. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is perhaps right to say that they might remain unsold. They are heavy volumes and more appropriate for building libraries than for stocking them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) should decide to retire and write his memoires, "Lost Horizons", he would be able to do so. He might prefer to dedicate them to the Boundary Commission and retitle them "Give them a minch and they'll take an isle".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we would rather have the birch than all this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) should be careful. He was not here when I was reallocating licences for boring in the North Sea. To him I would award the pout box.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Renfrewshire West (Mr. Buchan), at the end of a long career, should decide to put together a few elegant essays under the title "Leftovers", he would be able to do so—although, after these Committee proceedings, I do not think that there would be much left to say. We might hope for a short, slim volume from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is not here. Perhaps he is at home scratching away with his pen. If he were to produce a work entitled "From my mail-bag", it would not matter if he had carried it or dipped into it; it would only matter if he had sewn it. That is the distinction, because the clause proposes no new code of morality or legality. It is not an extension of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the clause is to put the impact of the present law into better repair. Its intention is to fulfil the purpose of the law as it stands, which is not always achieved, namely, to punish the criminal and to prevent his very criminality from becoming the route to profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many examples of this. Perhaps the best is that of the great train robbers who stole £2½ million from a train—money which belonged to a wide number of people and institutions—viciously assaulted the driver, and indeed, fore-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1548</span>
shortened his life. The first thing they did on coming out of prison was to set up a company to market the film and book rights of their wicked activities. I think that that is perhaps the classical example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been other more recent and salacious cases in some of the Scottish newspapers. I shall not grace them by naming them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking overseas there was the Watergate scandal. All the villains of that piece produced books and television plays and made lecture tours. They have all become, if not folk heroes, certainly celebrities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phenomenon is one that not only enriches criminals but also neutralises our moral judgment. It changes notoriety into fame. It purges the stigma of guilt but it does not do it with sackcloth and ashes, it does it with silk and cigar ash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that not all books written from prison have been written by criminals of the sort he appears to have in mind? They have included some very distinguished figures, such as Oscar Wilde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be true. A literary work of art is very different from the case where a criminal comes out of prison and sells his story to a newspaper or to a television company that is waiting with an open cheque book. I accept that, having served a sentence, a criminal should have a chance to make a fresh start in life. But the simple mathematical formula of a certain number of years or months spent in prison does not automatically grant full atonement. Full atonement depends, it seems to me, on future behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are examples of men who honourably went to gaol—conscientious objectors, for instance—and who later wrote books about the experience. I can think of at least one distinguished Secretary of State for Scotland, the late Arthur Woodburn, who did precisely that and, indeed, was the longest lasting solitary confinement prisoner in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may elaborate on that case if he catches your eye, Mr. Gourlay. But, as I see it, that was not a crime and, therefore, would not be caught by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If society is to give the benefit to a criminal of saying, once he has served
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1549</span>
his sentence, "That is it, the slate is clean," it is quite unacceptable that the criminal should use that opportunity not to earn his reacceptance by honest toil, industry and good behaviour, but by capitalising on his earlier crime. The more horrendous the crime, the greater the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about the role of the press and the media, because I believe that they, in certain sectors, are potentially more culpable of initiating this unhealthy trend with tempting offers to criminals. The clause does not suggest any form of censorship. There is no question of preventing the press from reporting the facts of cases of this nature. Nor, indeed, is there any case for preventing the criminal from giving his story to the press. What is unacceptable, and would be an offence under the clause, is the offer and acceptance of reward. By offering money I think that the media are, at best, suspending judgment on the crime and, at worst, they are condoning it and becoming accessories to it. Their offence is greater, because they are not under duress or in poverty. They are often the initiators. They place temptation before the criminal at a time of particular vulnerability. Their motive is not fame or reinstatement but pure profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, the clause penalises the press and the media considerably more heavily than it does the individual. The blurring of moral judgment that publications of that type bring about rubs off on those who read the books and see the films. The stories inevitably become selective in their approach to the facts of the case. Events are glamorised and presented in a glorified light. That undermines the moral fabric of our society and is the danger of the present unhappy arrangements. But, fortunately, many people can still react with bitter resentment to what has happened. I believe that they are right to be outraged because we must respond to the danger of the law becoming an ass. It is certainly a matter that we have no right to neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the technicalities of implementing a measure of this nature, I confess to being less than certain. The wording of the new clause is my own. I have sought or received no help from outside sources, and the wording may require amendment. I am aware, too, that the Bill applies to Scotland only, which may create problems. Therefore, I certainly seek the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1550</span>
guidance of my hon. and learned Friend on these aspects. I recognise that problems would be created for broadcasters and publishers of national newspapers that cross frontiers between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, although I suggest that the solutions lie in their own hands. The restraint imposed by the law of Scotland might temper their approach to publication in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, it would be preferable for the provision to have United Kingdom application. Indeed, Parliament voted in support of such a measure under the Ten Minute Rule four years ago, for lack of time and Government sympathy, it progressed no further. But if Scotland leads on such an issue, is that not the best way of persuading the rest of the United Kingdom to follow? If the clause is unacceptable as it stands, I look to the Minister for clear assurances and commitments that the matter will be seriously and constructively examined before I desist from pressing it in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to me that the present state of the law on this subject is in need of change. We face a growing trend of unscrupulous exploitation and profiteering in the media on the foul soil of criminality, which rewards the criminal and benefits those who do business with him. I believe that it threatens the moral values of the people of this country—particularly the moral values and judgment of impressionable young people. I—and, I believe, many other people—find that trend obscene, offensive and intolerable. I believe that it is time we found a way of putting a stop to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Curiously enough, I have a certain inclination toward approval of what the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) is trying to do. The trouble comes when we try to legalise and categorise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any crime is what society thinks, at any point in time, is a crime. That is part of the problem. We all know that the people who used a metal bar, or whatever it was, on the driver of the mail train in the great train robbery committed a crime. The trouble is that often what some people think is a crime turns out in the future to be a noble endeavour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a church in Rome called Santi Pietro e Paolo in Vinculo—Saints Peter and Paul in chains. No doubt they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1551</span>
in chains because they were committing what were seen as crimes in Rome. I do not know what would happen to the New Testament if we pushed that argument too far. One thinks of John Knox, who was picked up at St. Andrew's Castle, and spent time on the French galleys. He was seen as committing treason against the State of Scotland and its ally, France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives some very noble and exalted examples, but would he care to indicate whether, in any of the cases that he cites, the perpetrator attempted to sell his story to the scribes of the tablets or the printers of the broadsheets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it did their reputation any harm among the people who supported them—John Knox or, for that matter, Cervantes, who also spent about a decade in the Turkish galleys out of which, among other things, flowed "Don Quixote". It is, therefore, a little difficult to say what is or is not derived from a particular experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could refer to Oscar Wilde and to at least two notable works that came out of his experience as a result of his crime. At that time, it was illegal in England and Wales. Incidentally, it is still illegal in Scotland, and it is time that that was changed. The two works were "De Profundis" and "The Ballad of Reading Gaol". He did not live much beyond the point of penury, but he received a return from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He did not sell his story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one says that an honest craftsman or writer is exploiting a situation, that is one thing. It is not true to say that Wilde exploited his gaol experience in "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" or "De Profundis". But it came from his experience of the crime and his experience afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but surely the crime in that instance was buggery, and he did not sell a story relating to buggery. There is no offence in selling the story of one's experiences in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But supposing he had and the book had become a best seller, he certainly would have profited from his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1552</span>
crime in so far as the gaol sentence would have given rise to the book. There are problems in the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. My instinct is rather to agree with it, as I am against exploitation for publicity purposes on behalf of people who have offended in this way. The problem is unlimited and the clause proposes a dangerous step forward which would not always be helpful in future rehabilitation. I am not sure that a person who has something to say, including comments on his own crime, should not be heard. Society may learn also from this and, if, in the meantime, it helps to keep him out of what would once have been a debtors' prison, perhaps it is no bad thing that we should see that he can get a return from an honest trade, but there are problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the example of Arthur Woodburn and his three years' solitary confinement. It was a case of a crime against the State—he had refused to obey the legal instruction to join the Army—but he lived to become the most distinguished Secretary of State for Scotland. He wrote about his experience and, in that case, his crime, as did many others of that period, such as Herbert Morrison. Why should they not write about their experiences and get a return for it to keep them alive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great problems is that we all know what a crime is—but we are often very wrong about that, and that is why I think that this is a dangerous precedent to set despite a certain inclination instinctively to like what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do. I agree with what he says but if he tried to put it into a legal framework I am not at all sure that we could approve of or follow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I liked the clause until I listened to the hon. Member. I do not mean that to be offensive. It was a well-worked speech, if I may say so. Spontaneity was not of its essence but, certainly, a great deal of effort had gone into it and I always admire honest diligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me about the clause is that, although it is superficially attractive, its exclusive concentration on the criminal's memoirs and his making money out of his autobiographical reminiscences is in itself mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) started by making the point that the salacious and, it seems to me, often deplorable intrusion into people's private
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1553</span>
lives that its represented by, say, showbiz memoirs or the like, would not be affected in any way by the clause. It occurred to me as I listened to the hon. Gentleman that I would find that kind of outthrust of gutter journalism—to quote him—more obscene and offensive than I often find the kind of work at which he is attempting to strike. I think that there is a little touch of vindictiveness—it is, perhaps, not conscious— in the hon. Gentleman's anxiety that the criminal should be picked out in this way—a criminal who presumably has tholed his assize, has gone through prison and who is to be the subject of this sort of legal censorship on his right to earn money by writing or dwelling on his own experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a lot of sympathy on one level. All of us probably read in prominent new spapers in Scotland recently the memoirs of Mrs. Sheila Garvie. I thought that they were offensive, but not because she herself had been convicted of a very serious crime—they would have been offensive if they had been merely the memoirs of a socialite or someone who moved in what is called high society. I am just a little anxious about the use of phrases such as "it is the memoirs of criminals that threaten the moral values of our society" to quote the hon. Member for Galloway. Many things threaten the moral values of our society, and anyway no doubt many of us would disagree on what proper values are or ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This picking out and excising from the mass of unpleasant information—which is often produced in the papers in an attempt to increase their circulation—and concentrating upon the memoirs of people who have been in trouble with the law, is unhealthy. Some of the most difficult memoirs that I have read recently, in terms of their unpleasantness, are those of Mrs. Khashoggi, for example, who spread herself with such easy fluency across the pages. It is no joking matter. There is a serious worry about the standards of those who think it is worth printing such things, without considering the damage done to third parties and people who—and I recognise immediately that I am in the area of 	<i>double entendre</i>—may have brushed against the lady at some point in her career. That would not be caught by this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the moral point that the hon. Member is making, and everyone on the Committee would have some sympathy with it. The exclusive way in which the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1554</span>
clause operates—as perhaps it must under the Bill—makes it, on balance, unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) mentioned a number of cases as examples of memoirs, books and literary works which have been based upon experiences of the criminal law, which have in themselves been extremely valuable. I could probably add one or two others if I thought about it. We are perhaps offended by the cheque book journalism syndrome—the immediate attempt to collar the star witness or the acquitted man to try to capitalise on the heat of public interest stirred up by particularly unpleasant or sensational details from a trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would strike at recollections made in tranquility—perhaps measured, perhaps sophisticated, perhaps wishful comments on a man's experience many years earlier. It would be unfortunate if we were to rule them out of court in their entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Watergate memoirs which the hon. Member for Galloway brought into his argument are an interesting example. I think that there were too many of them, but I certainly enjoyed—and I hope it would not be thought that my moral values had been undermined—"All the President's Men". I not only enjoyed John Dean's "Blind Ambition" but I considered it a valuable documentary account of how power can be abused in a political system. Any of us who scramble about in the foothills of power, can learn something from John Dean's experience of how a man of genuine and obvious ability was corrupted by expediency as he made his way through the political processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that there is a genuine problem under discussion at which the hon. Member attempts to strike, but I think the Committee would be unwise to take the piecemeal approach of removing crime from the general area of journalistic and literary standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what Ministers will recommend, but I personally—because this is certainly not a party matter for Opposition Members,—would not feel able to vote for the new clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is general agreement that the arguments used by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) create a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1555</span>
deal of support in principle from many members of the Committee and indeed from the general public. Certain forms of journalism and publishing create a great feeling of abhorrence among many sections of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may make a preliminary point to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), a distinction can rightly be drawn between the publication of events relating to a criminal offence and those relating to other matters which may be morally disapproved of, but which in terms of sheer practicality are difficult to define in legislative terms. If my hon. Friend is covering such an area, it is more appropriate to deal with criminal matters which are more easily identifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the new clause, arguments both of principle and practicality must be taken into account. In principle my hon. Friend's proposals could amount to a substantial restriction on the right of free speech for certain members of the community. Those who have committed offences and served their sentences would be restricted from expressing their views publicly. That is a serious matter with which Parliament should consider dealing only if special circumstances justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain hon. Members have commented that many publications relating to criminal offences are made for reasons of pure financial profit. It is those that give rise to social condemnation. There have been, and no doubt will continue to be, examples where a person who has committed a crime but who, having tholed his assize, has become a respectable member of the community, feels that he has something to contribute that will be of interest to society and which may, indeed, persuade potential criminals to desist from that course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is right that we should take that into account, because the published experiences of an ex-criminal who has changed his way of life will be of particular value in seeking to influence public attitudes and, in particular, to influence those who may otherwise be attracted to a course of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are factors that ought to be taken into account in determining whether any legislative barrier of that kind should be imposed. My hon. Friend recognised that and sought in his argument to direct our consideration to those publications where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1556</span>
the motive of the person publishing is to achieve financial gain. I think that he was right to emphasise that motive is the most important criterion. Where the motive is financial gain, some of the more noble sentiments to which I have referred would not apply. Cash or profit would be motivating the publication of what might be sordid details of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's clause does not deal with the difficulty of how to establish motive. How on earth are we, or a court, to determine the specific motive of a publication? Clearly, if conviction depended upon motive being established, and financial gain had to be the purpose for which the publication was being produced, the person charged with such an offence could maintain, without any obvious proof to the contrary, that his intentions were noble—either for education, or to inform the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we deal with the situation that has occasionally taken place where the person has received financial payment as an award, but has given them to charity? Technically, he has received profits from his publication. It may be that for various reasons he did not wish to hold on to them and therefore has given them to a charity but, technically, the question of profit would still arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These issues of principle have to be taken into account, because we would not wish to prevent or prohibit publications which might be in the public interest, although they arise out of a criminal offence committed by a particular individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Press Council has sought to influence newspapers to take a responsible attitude. It indicated some years ago that it would be inappropriate for newspapers to make cash payments for publishing the criminal offences or criminal history of individuals unless it was clearly in the public interest that they should be published. We may all be somewhat sceptical as to the effect that that has had on certain newspapers but no doubt it has influenced the more responsible newspapers to be careful about making payments or accepting the need for publication of articles, of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I find that the practical problems of implementation give the greatest cause for concern. My hon. Friend referred to the fact that this would only be a Scottish measure. Even if it were a United Kingdom measure it would not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

necessarily solve the problem. If there were a prohibition on publication within this country or if the story were sufficiently juicy and likely to produce sufficient sales, there would be nothing to stop the writer finding a publisher in France, America or another country who would be only too happy to produce the book, article or film if that would bring substantial profits. Unless one also made it an offence to circulate or offer for sale such a book in this country, the restriction would be meaningless and ineffectual. I am sure my hon. Friend would agree that, in practice, it would be extremely difficult to ban the sale in this country of books that were based on the criminal experiences of a United Kingdom citizen when the similar experiences of a French or American citizen were still freely on sale. It would be a difficult argument and would create great problems in seeking to persuade the general public as to what is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, we have not even reached that stage because this would be a new clause which, if incorporated into the Bill, would apply only to Scotland. There would, of course, be nothing to stop publication in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of those matters, which would then be equally available to the viewer, the listener or the reader in Scotland. As regards broadcasting, clearly it could happen simultaneously in all parts of the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, I recognise that this is an important area which causes offence to the community and which, I think, would cause great offence to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explore the matter further with my colleagues in the Home Office who are responsible for these matters in England and Wales, to see whether there is a view that a United Kingdom measure of this type would be appropriate. The matter was considered by a previous Administration. My hon. Friend will remember that it was then the view that the disadvantages of pursuing the matter in this way outweighed the advantages. I will certainly undertake to have the matter considered by my hon. and right hon. Friends who deal with such matters for other parts of the United Kingdom, although I must tell my hon. Friend that unless it were to be done on a United Kingdom basis I do not think that it would be practical to do it for any one part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1558</span>
With that undertaking to look at the matter on the wider front, I hope my hon. Friend will feel able not to press his clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to admit that when I was in Glasgow, Central, the other day, this was not the burning issue of the day, although one passer-by in Buchanan Street had a word with me about it, and if he is the modern equivalent of Bagehot's man on the Clapham omnibus, it is perhaps something which the Government should be tackling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment briefly on one or two points that have been raised, and which I have found interesting. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referrred to a possible subconscious vindictiveness against criminals who have tholed their assize and come out of prison. Perhaps there is something in that. I feel that one can never fully atone for a crime. One can serve a sentence and, as I said in my speech, that sentence can never totally wipe the slate clean. But certainly the intention of the clause was to put the balance of vindictiveness against the publisher because I believe that there the guilt is much more clear cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the reference to salacious memoirs, I entirely agree that they are unsavoury. The reason I sought to avoid going down that avenue was to avoid the whole question of free speech and censorship. I was most anxious in framing the clause to avoid any charge of inhibiting free speech. Therefore, there is nothing in the clause to prevent a criminal from writing of his experiences or even of his criminal activities. The point is that if he does so, he should not be in a position to profit from it. The motivating force of making money is the overriding factor in assessing those things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly there is no intention in any way to prohibit the production of works of art. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) gave one or two examples of works of art which were produced, for example, by Oscar Wilde when he wrote De Profundis. There will be no question of preventing the publication of something based on a personal experience winch had perhaps been earned in prison. Again, one has to look for the motive and if the motive had been to sell one's story in order to profit by it, and that story had been one of criminality, it is something upon which the courts should

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1559</span>
have the opportunity to pass sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the criminal took the proceeds and passed them on to charity, that, of course, would be a fact for the court to take into account in passing sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of Solzhenitsyn. He, of course, is guilty of no crime in this country and, therefore, that sort of case would not be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is an overriding duty on the law to respond to changing trends in our society and I think that this is a particularly unsavoury trend to which the law has a duty to try to respond. Sometimes there should be an overriding force simply to pass a law, aware of the difficulties and anomalies it may create, and try to give the courts the chance to get on with it and make of it what they can. If it does not work they can come back to Parliament again and have those anomalies ironed out. My legal friends may tell me that that is sacrilege, but having heard what my hon. Friend the Minister has had to say—I am particularly grateful to him for his assurances that he is willing to explore the matter further in a United Kingdom context—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that I am not able to move the clause with the elegance and eloquence or the sophisticated touch of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or brevity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State has made a good point, because on the previous occasion when I tried brevity it was most successful. Certainly I have no intention of doing other than saying what is essential. The fact that I have no need to recourse to flowery, eloquent phrases emphasises that the clause represents a substantial argument in itself and needs no eloquent and fancy addition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is substantially the same and has substantially the same effect as the Private Member's Bill introduced in the House by the previous hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire— Georeg Reid. Notwithstanding his political views—which you and I, Mr. Gourlay do not share—I believe that in bringing the matter before the House he did great service to the House. Members of the previous Parliament will be more familiar with the provisions than I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the purpose of the clause is first, to introduce a new procedure of exclusion orders to enable a wife to have the husband who is battering her excluded from the matromonial home for a period of 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1563</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are difficulties in moving a complicated Bill in one new clause. It is not only a matter of the battering husband because the criterion in clause 1 is the risk that any party will be subjected to violence. The violence does not need to have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am open to correction—particularly by my hon. Friend—I understand that to show that a risk is present there must be evidence of some previous record. No doubt these matters can be explored during any debate that takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the exclusion order is to make sure that what happens is the opposite of what happens now. Now, the wife and children are excluded from the home and the husband—the guilty party—is allowed to stay for reasons about which we all know, that the tenancy is normally in the name of the husband or the house is normally owned by the husband. As a result of that the guilty person can remain in the house and the person who is "sinned against"—to use the phrase of the Solicitor-General for Scotland—has to leave and take the children. That is the problem. The children are taken from the house and often from the area in which they go to school, causing tremendous problems for the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also increases the powers for the courts to grant interdicts and interim interdicts to deal with the matter immediately. The exclusion orders and interdicts would be enforced by making breach of the exclusion orders a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to £500, imprisonment for three months, or both—to return to a point which was discussed on the previous occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may ask whether this is a grave problem in Scotland. I am sure that those hon. Members who have been involved with Scottish Women's Aid and with its branches throughout the country will be aware of the increasing extent of the problem in Scotland. At the risk of boring, but with the intention of convincing, the Committee, I want to mention a few statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year Scottish Women's Aid provided refuge in its refuges in Scotland for 702 women and 1,241 children. AH those women and children were excluded from their homes. The children were taken
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1564</span>
away from the areas in which they went to school. The lives of the women and children were upset as a result. If the new clause were accepted, those women and children would be able to continue in their homes and their husbands—the guilty parties—would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the extent of the problem is greater than that. There were 400 women who were unable to get into the refuges. There were 1,132 women who sought advice from the advice service of Scottish Women's Aid. These women were not at the point of having to seek refuge but were in great distress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those women may well ask how long it will be before Parliament will take action. How many others are too frightened or ashamed to come forward to seek help and refuge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many anonymous examples available from Women's Aid given by the then hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire when the matter was discussed previously. I shall not detain the Committee by giving any such examples; I do not think it would be helpful to do so. However, I can assure the Committee that there are more examples week by week, as members of Scottish Women's Aid can confirm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends have doubts about the part of the new clause dealing with corroboration. When we discussed corroboration on a previous amendment, I declinined to vote. We are not suggesting that exclusion orders or interdicts should be granted merely on the evidence of one person, namely, the wife. But we are saying that the nature of the offences is that they take place in the home and on almost every occasion no one else is able to give evidence. That is inherent in the offence. We are saying that it is not only on the wife's evidence. There must be surrounding circumstantial evidence. For example, if the police are called and find the women in a certain state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is very important. The new clause does not say that. The law is that if the wife gives evidence and the surrounding circumstances are, for example, her running to a neighbour in tears or having marks upon her, that would be sufficient corroboration. The new clause makes it clear that no such surrounding circumstances are needed. It removes corroboration. Perhaps my hon. Friend could direct my attention to the phrase
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1565</span>
in the new clause which retains the corroboration he suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is aware that I am not a lawyer and have no legal training. However, the new clause was drawn up by a lawyer with whom I have had discussions. I have discussed the new clause with Scottish Women's Aid. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is no need for my hon. Friends to get unnecessarily jubilant at having found a flaw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not jubilant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a tendency to jubilation in their attitude in having found what appears to be a flaw. I am willing to take advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to mislead. If my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden will listen instead of always talking when other hon. Members are speaking he may learn something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that if my intention is not included in the wording of the new clause, I am willing to take advice and to have the wording changed so that it represents my intention. My intention is that there should not be a need for a second witness, for corroborated testimony, for someone to have been present. Circumstantial evidence from people who may not have been present at the incident would, in my view, be enough to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to be critical of such a new clause. If the Government are unable to accept the new clause will the Solicitor-General give the Committee today some indication of the Government's intention? My information is that the Scottish Law Commission's report "Family Law: Occupancy Rights in the Matrimonial Home and Domestic Violence" is before the Law Officers and, I hope, before the Secretary of State for Scotland, although it has not yet been published, for reasons beyond the Government's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be of help to us today if the Solicitor-General were able to give us some inclination of the Government's intention on this important report. I should like to see a change in this law emanating from the Government. I should like the new clause to be correctly drafted by legal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1566</span>
draftsmen who have knowledge and experience and the backing of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the new clause is not principally to be seen as something which is easily, cleverly and carefully included in the Bill, but to draw attention yet again to an important matter, which is worrying and concerning women in Scotland, and on which the Government have received a report from the Scottish Law Commission. I hope that the Government will give an indication that they intend to do something about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been indicated that the next Session of Parliament will be uncluttered by other legislation. Therefore, I hope that the Solicitor-General will give us some indication now that in the next session the Government might be able to introduce legislation along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is four years since the Domestic Violence and Matromonial Proceedings Act 1976 was passed for England and Wales. It is five years since the Select Committee on Violence in Marriage recommended that battered women in Scotland should have greater protection. The battered women of Scotland are entitled to ask how much longer they are to wait before Parliament does something to deal with their problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have considerable sympathy for the objectives of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes)—I have in the past acted for such groups as Gingerbread and Refuge for Battered Wives in Edinburgh. I have the greatest hestitation and reservations about attempting to introduce the matter into the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. As the hon. Member has rightly pointed out, this is a vexed matter which is currently being considered, or may now be concluded in its consideration, by the Scottish Law Commission. There are a number of detailed points which, like the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) I should like to have had the opportunity to consider in the greatest of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience in the consistorial courts has been that the greatest single problem about domestic violence is not after decree of divorce has been pronounced but during that interim period from the point of separation until decree of divorce has been pronounced. What is not entirely clear to me—even if the exclusion order
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1567</span>
procedure as set out in the new clause were to be introduced—is whether that would expedite matters and make it that much easier for wives who, as the hon. Member has pointed out, are from time to time in large numbers in Scotland exposed to a quite unacceptable degree of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose the new clause, but I do not think that it fits appropriately into the Bill. However, I share with the hon. Member for South Ayrshire the sentiment that it will be the Government's intention to introduce legislation as soon as they have the opportunity to consider what the Scottish Law Commission says on occupancy rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that I raised the ire of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) by raising the point about subsection (6) of his new clause. If I did, I am sorry. It is, however, a substantial point and I thought that perhaps he misunderstood the nature of the law of corroboration, which, of course, does not require two eye witnesses, but can have supporting circumstances such as he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing I would say that, as I understand subsection (6) of the new clause, it clearly removes the need for corroboration and would therefore require detailed examination. I perfectly appreciate my hon. Friend's point that he would be happy to consider changes if it did not meet the intention which he has expressed. From what he has said, it is clear that a further amendment would be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments, on the lines he indicated, were brought in, it would remove one of the important technical difficulties for many of us in this set of proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enormous sympathy with the intention of the new clause. I do not think that anyone in the Committee will say otherwise. I have some doubts which cannot properly be aired here or properly debated in the context of the new clause, because I am sure my hon. Friend would accept that it would need a Committee stage in its own right to straighten them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (l)(a) says that the court must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied that there is a risk that that party or any child of the family will be subjected to violence by the other party to the marriage."</p></blockquote>
There may be considerable difficulties
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1568</span>
about what "will be subjected"—which is in the future tense—would mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, another trigger subsection, (l)(	<i>c</i>), is an area for debate and consideration. It has the concept that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"order shall not be considered unnecessary merely because the pursuer could obtain protection by leaving the matrimonial home if in all the circumstances of the case it would be unreasonable to require the pursuer to leave the matrimonial home."</p></blockquote>
That again is a subjective concept for the court, which we would certainly want to discuss at some length. There are a large number of similar points which require detailed consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an enormously important job to be done in strengthening the position of women in respect of matrimonial property. I am not talking about the category of battered women. I have dealt with a large number of women professionally who I thought had an extremely strong moral claim to stay on in the matrimonial home because of the social circumstances of family. It was not the guilt or innocence of the break-up of the marriage necessarily but the social circumstances of the family in terms of the proper housing of the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer to look at this not just in terms of the phenomenon of the battered wife but in terms of the rights of the woman to a home which is indeed the family home. Such a home may nominally in law remain in the name of the husband but it has been bought during the course of the marriage, and the wife has fully contributed to it in terms of bringing up the family, whether or not she be working. There is a case for saying that the concept of matrimonial property in Scotland, which is that it belongs to an individual and not to the marriage, requires careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have some worries about making this important reform only in terms of the category of women who are under threat of violence. That might lead to certain unfairnesses and distortions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak only for myself in joining the call for early legislation in this field—properly prepared and with a proper time for discussion. I hope that we can get some indication from the Solicitor-General that he will be in a position to commit the Government to early legislation, perhaps on a more comprehensive scale than the new clause envisages—but if it is to be limited to women in peril of violence, we must have time to look in some detail at the full implications.

My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is right in bringing forward the new clause as a means of drawing attention to the matter and, we hope, of adding pressure to the push for action. I trust that he gains some reward when the Solicitor-General replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for those remarks. As the debate progressed, it seemed to me strange, for two reasons, that the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was so concerned with battered women—first, because a Socialist of such purity should treat men and women as equal and as equally likely to be bettered and, second, because his verbal and—I thought for a moment—nearly physical assaults on the unfortunate hon. Member for Garscadden made me anxious, as a prospectively battered male when I rose to speak, that the topic should be widened to include both sexes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire has raised a most desirable concept, but this is not the Bill in which to legislate for such matters. They are of extreme complexity. Nothing is more difficult than the division of the indivisible, and the matrimonial home is one of those. One fundamental defect—apart from those that the hon. Member for Garscadden pointed out—is that one cannot say that it is the wife who should leave the matrimonial home. If the matrimonial home belongs to the husband, there is little point in excluding him from it, when he can exclude his wife as a matter of civil right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, therefore, would not be sufficient. It does not deal with ownership and occupancy. One might end up with an empty home. That is a fundamental flaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not wish to deal with the matter on that basis. What I wish to say, which I think will be acceptable to all sides of the Committee, is that the Scottish Law Commission report on "Occupancy Rights in the Matrimonial Home and Domestic Violence"—it deals with matters not only associated with domestic violence—is in the hands of the Law Officers and is being given urgent consideration. It will be published in July, with a draft Bill for consideration and comment. That is the extent of the urgency with which we are facing the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1570</span>
In the previous Government, the then Lord Advocate and the Secretary of State gave evidence to the Select Committee on Violence in Marriage. It was as a result of that that the matter was referred to the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an extremely important matter which is extremely difficult to resolve. The hon. Member for Garscadden mentioned, for example, the abolition of corroboration. There are a variety of difficulties in providing that an 	<i>ex parte</i> statement should be sufficient to get someone out of a house and get the house in one's own name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, however, that, when the report is published with the draft Bill, it will give rise to a lively debate and to constructive solutions to what we would all agree is always a very difficult problem—that of one house, two conflicting parties and children who have an interest in having a roof over their heads, possibly with the parent who would not be excluded. There are major difficulties in the division 	<i>una juncta in trio.</i> I hope that, when we publish the report and the draft Bill, hon. Members will help us to come to an equitable solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw the motion. I shall not blame him for its construction, its complexity or its length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and the Solicitor-General both said that it might not be appropriate to insert the clause. I thought that there was some argument for bringing that kind of domestic violence within the scope of criminal justice in Scotland. But I recognise that there are a number of other aspects that cannot properly be dealt with when we are discussing such a complicated new clause to such a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had no objection whatever to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) raising points under clause 6, or indeed under any other clause. It was the manner in which they were raised to which I objected. But in the light of what he said earlier—I do not think that there would be any point in pursuing the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Solicitor-General raised a question about my discrimination between man and woman. Often in legal and other descriptions it is said that we use the phrase "man embraces woman" or "men embrace women." In this case I was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1571</span>
using the word "woman," and woman was embracing man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, in 99 per cent, of the cases it is the woman who is the object of the violence. However, I do not think that it would be helpful to follow up any of the other points raised, except to say that I welcome the Solicitor-General's announcement that the report is to be published in July. I think that the Committee will welcome, even more, that a draft Bill is to be produced. I cannot speak on behalf of the official Opposition on the urgency expressed by the Solicitor-General Perhaps I may speak on behalf of the unofficial Opposition and say that he will get all support from us if the Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for the next session. In the light of what the Solicitor-General said I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb --> PREVENTION OF CRIME ACT 1871
<br><br><!-- lb --> IN RELATION TO SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"Section 15 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1871 is repealed in so far as it applies to Scotland.".—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause deals with the "sus" law. Many of us were somewhat surprised to discover, when we read the second report from the Home Affairs Select Committee, that the "sus" law applies to Scotland. It is, as we all know, section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. It is applied to Scotland in specific terms by section 15 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1871.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go at any great length through the arguments that make the "sus" law unacceptable to many of our colleagues south of the border. The Committee will remember that there was one dissenter against a key part of the report, but there was a great deal of all-party support on the Select Committee that "sus" should be abolished. I hope that may happen south of the border in the course of time. But the arguments in Scotland are a little different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extraordinary thing is that "sus" applies as a legal possibility in Scotland, but the law has not, as far as I know, been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1572</span>
operated to any real extent. I asked a parliamentary question on 17 June 1980 and was told in a written reply by the Secretary of State for Scotland that in 1978 there were 504 prosecutions in Scotland under either section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 or section 409 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892. The reply stated that it was understood that most of the proceedings were under section 409 of the 1892 Act. It is referred to in the Home Affairs committee report in reply to another parliamentary question. The Solicitor-General said that prosecutions under the "sus" provision are brought only occasionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly it is my experience, as someone who has been around the courts for a number of years, that charges under section 4 of the 1824 Act are extremely rare in Scotland. It seems to me that it is a piece of legislation that we could well do without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision was, of course, found by the Home Affairs Committee to be objectionable in principle and I agree with that as a general argument. The committee then went on to consider in some detail the possibility that it was being selectively applied in a discriminatory fashion against minority groups in society, in particular, against groups of coloured citizens. That, again, is not a consideration in Scotland, because I have not heard any allegation of any such bias in its occasional use north of the border. We certainly do not need this provision. It is a totally archaic and extraordinary survival on our statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee to remember if I read section 4, which I am attempting to repeal. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"every suspected person or reputed thief frequenting or loitering about in any river, canal, or navigable stream, dock or basin, or any quay, wharf, or warehouse near or adjoining thereto, or any street, highway or avenue leading thereto, or any place of public resort, or any avenue leading thereto, or any street, or any highway, or any place adjacent to a street or highway, with intent to commit an arrestful offence…shall be deemed a rogue and a vagabond".</p></blockquote>
That is archaic lumber and there can be no serious argument that in Scotland it is necessary to retain that offence in order to maintain the operation of our legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have in any event—and we are not attempting to remove them—the provisions of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892, which is much more commonly used in circumstances where this "sus" law might be applicable. In all the cir-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1573</span>
cumstances, not least because the provision is objectionable in principle and is open to abuse, as the Select-Committee on Home Affairs suggested, I hope that the Government will accept that it is an unnecessary and redundant survival on our statute book, I hope that the new clause will find favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will recall that, when the Home Secretary replied to a debate on the "sus" law on the Floor of the House, he indicated that the Government wished to consult the police and other interested parties in the light of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. That Committee dealt almost exclusively with the problems of "sus" south of the border and, although the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the Act is a United Kingdom Act it is well known that most of the criticism has been concerned with the application of these provisions against minorities, particularly against members of the coloured communities. This is where it has been felt that the law has been unfairly applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Scotland is, as the hon. Gentleman rightly indicated, that although section 4 exists on the statute book, most of the prosecutions that have taken place have been under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts and they apply only to known or reputed thieves and not to suspected persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, these matters in so far as they affect Scotland, are to be discussed more fully in Parliament in the not too distant future. The Government intend to publish this summer a draft civic government Bill for Scotland. It will be published as a White Paper and will include the Government's proposals to replace the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts and the other legislation covering this area. We obviously have to take into account the views of the working party that was set up to recommend on the civic government legislation and we shall also take into account the comments of the Select Committee on Home Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be opportunity, therefore, during the summer to see the Government's response in draft form to the representations that have been made, to consider whether it is appropriate, and to take the views of outside of bodies. Eventually
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1574</span>
Parliament will have the chance to consider a Bill which will be submitted for its consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman can therefore be assured that the matter is under active consideration. The demise of the various burgh Acts requires a civic government Bill to replace them. The Government is dealing with that as a matter of priority in the way that I have indicated. I hope in those circumstances that the hon. Gentleman will not press his new clause now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not find that reply entirely satisfactory. If the new clause attempted to repeal section 409 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892, that would be an extremely persuasive argument by the Minister. The new Bill, which speaks of and hopes to see on the statute book and is to be the subject of a preliminary discussion paper—which I welcome—would largely deal with the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My case is that the "sus" provision, which is extended to Scotland by the Prevention of Crime Act 1971, is a slightly different issue. It is not used much in Scotland and is objectionable in principle. The Select Committee on Home Affairs dealt only with the English arguments but, as hon. Members will remember it dealt also with the objectionable nature of "sus" in principle and went on to talk about its certain practical consequence which renders its operation equally open to objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of what emerges from the White Paper and the discussion and legislation following from it—it may well bring about a total reformation of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts and bring about a new statutory framework for dealing with this kind of situation—it seems inconceivable that it will lead to the survival of the "sus" law in Scotland, even if "sus" survives south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstood what I said. The proposals that will appear in the draft Bill to be published this summer will not simply replace the existing provisions of the Burgh Acts. They will also replace the provisions of the 1824 Act as they are applied in Scotland. The whole matter, in other words, will be dealt with by a new provision which, henceforth, will be found within the civic government Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, well, perhaps. I hope the Minister does not take this as a threat, but I can see all sorts of areas of interest which we might discuss at some length about the possible revamping of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act. I cannot think of any argument which can plausibly be advanced for the retention on the statute book of a "sus" provision under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which, according to the Parliamentary answers is seldom used, and is an importation from English statute south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Rebfrewshire, West, (Mr. Buchan) that it would simplfy— which ought to appeal to the Committee— the discussions on the future of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act and this whole area of law if we could get rid of the irrelevancy of the application of the "sus" law north of the border at this stage. Let us clear away this minor impediment and get down, when the White Paper is issued, to constructive discussion about how the law of Scotland can be reformed. Surely that reform will not incorporate the survival of this English importation which, in any event, is being fundamentally attacked root and branch even south of the border. I do not find the Minister's offer very tempting at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not the hon. Gentleman finds my offer tempting, is not for me to say, but I am not saying that the "sus" element of the existing law will necessarily find a place in the draft Bill to be published. I am saying, and obviously, hon. Gentlemen will see what is in the draft Bill when it is published, that it is right that, as it is to be the subject of consultation with outside interests, it would seem a rather poor form of consultation to repeal it now thereby giving the impression that Parliament had in advance reached a definite decision on that aspect, being prepared to consult only on that which remained. The Government's views will be advanced in the draft Bill. No firm conclusions will be referred to in the draft Bill. It will be subject to consultation with all interested bodies and then, subject to the consequence of that consultation, it will be possible to come to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have at the moment only a report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs which did not look at the matter in Scotland and which, effectively, made no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1576</span>
recommendations for Scotland. I know that they did not specifically exclude Scotland but they were not dealing with problems that existed north of the border and, therefore, there has been no real consultation or consideration of the "sus" aspect north of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not necessarily disagree with the hon. Gentleman's point of view. To accept a new clause of that kind at this stage would appear, and would rightly be interpreted, as coming to a firm conclusion. That might have been appropriate if there were not to be an opportunity in the near future to look at the whole issue. It would then be right to say that we do not know when we shall have another opportunity to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have indicated to the hon. Gentleman that there will be an opportunity in the near future to deal with this whole vexed area of which "sus" is only an element, as the hon. Gentleman will recognise. It would, therefore, be quite inappropriate to come to a conclusion at this stage on one aspect of a matter which is to be the subject of overall consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We may well have a constructive discussion about other aspects, but I believe that the sooner we are rid of this peculiar appendage to our legal armoury the better. In view of the Minister's undertaking that there will be consultation in the not too distant future, and that there will be legislation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the right that is sought in the clause would already have existed in statute, but apparently it does not. No doubt the lawyers on the Government Front Bench will correct me if I am wrong, but a solicitor brought to my attention an incident that has arisen since the start of our Committee proceedings. He was present when premises were being searched and the police officer would not let him make a photocopy of the document concerned. It would have taken two or three minutes. The police officer held it in his hand for the people concerned to read. I am informed that there was no challenge, then or since, to the legality of the document. It was a proper legal search warrant. It is extremely odd that, on such occasions, a copy of the document should not be deposited with the occupier of the premises concerned. I hope that this minor right will be accepted by the Government. It seems to be an odd omission in the law, if it is an omission, and one that should be put right. I hope that the Government will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrongly anticipated that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), with his immense concern for matters Scottish, would cite the precedent of the case in Cornwall which was written up in the 	<i>New Statesman.</i> Perhaps Cornwall is in the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no objection in principle to this matter. In Scotland a person is shown a warrant where the search is on warrant. The reason why he would be shown it and not given it, or allowed to take a photocopy of it, is a practical difficulty. A warrant is frequently obtained at unsocial hours. One may have a warrant to search 10 different houses if there has been a bank robbery or some such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the hon. Member for the Western Isles, being a tolerant and kind-hearted person, would not mind signing innumerable warrants in the middle of the night. However, on the whole, the experience of police officers and procurators-fiscal makes them rather reluctant to do it and, therefore, a number of searches are normally put on one warrant. There are circumstances in which one would not wish prospective suspected bank robber A to see who else was sus-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1578</span>
pected so that the moment the search was finished he could get on the telephone and say "Look, boys. They are coming round to you next." There may be information on a composite warrant which one would not wish the householder to see. I know of no circumstance in Scotland where it has been alleged that a search proceeded on a warrant that applied to another person or other premises. The warrant, I think I am right in saying—no doubt the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will spring into oscillation if I am wrong—is produced in such a case. Therefore, if there should be any question of evidence which fell outside the scope of the warrant having been obtained, that could be challenged in court, and if the search had been made without a warrant the circumstances in court would justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall look at the matter. I have no objection in principle. I have given the practical difficulty. It is not a matter which has given rise to complaint, but I shall look at it and see whether, generally speaking, warrants can be made separately and the copies given to the person. However, this raises logistic difficulties, and that is why in the case cited I am almost certain that that warrant held information which did not relate to the other person and which the police officer did not want the other person to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This matter, set out in two lines, is both important and simple. I follow the example of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who said that he had never read the Thomson report and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1579</span>
did not intend to do so or to call it in aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made no study of the practice—the numbers—in regard to jury verdicts or anything else. I put a layman's point of view—a commonsense point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three differences between the jury system in Scotland and the jury system in England. First, there are 15 jurors instead of 12. Secondly, we have a "not proven" verdict. That matters in this discussion. Thirdly, for a long time we have had majority decisions in Scottish verdicts, and only in the last two or three years have majority decisions been introduced in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even bringing that part of the English law into line with the Scottish law has exposed a major fallacy in the existing Scottish practice. When the provision was introduced in England, majority verdicts were restricted to a 10 to two basis. If we were setting out afresh today to establish the nature of majority verdicts, we would not come up with what we have now, namely, that by a simple majority, an eight to seven majority, for example, a man can be found guilty or not guilty— although the latter does not arise, in the sense that one juror opting out, even when there is a majority verdict, prevents such a decision. Of course, it matters in relation to the timing of a verdict of guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking as a layman from a common-sense point of view, it can hardly be said that guilt is established and that it is our job in a court not to establish innocence but to establish guilt. If we fail to establish guilt, we should be able to say that innocence has been established. If we are not like the Solicitor-General for Scotland in one of his wilder weekend moods, we should be able to do so. That is the nature of the law as it effects that subject. It seems manifest—it has nothing to do with the law or its complications—that if a verdict is achieved on an eight to seven basis, it cannot be argued that there is no reasonable doubt. By definition, on such a basis, there is reasonable doubt. At least seven out of the 15 people have expressed sufficient doubt to hold up their own vote on the matter. I think that we are dealing with a simple, plain man situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not gone for the moon. I have not suggested that there should be a unanimous decision. I have not tabled a new clause which seeks to remove the words "not proven" in order to make a "not proven"
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1580</span>
decision automatically a "not guilty" decision. I have left it to the simple proposition—"Let's move the thing forward." I have not gone into the other possibility of four to one, which would be a 12 to three situation, because I recognise that if a new clause is added to the end of a Bill it is not part of the general structure. But let us make the sensible and obvious decision that if a man is to be found guilty by majority, at least there must be a sufficiency of opinion and a removal of the probability of innocence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple proposition is that we now change a majority verdict to a 10 to five situation. Sometimes a juror, as happened in a recent Dundee case, is not present. One cannot say a 10 to five majority in such a situation as there will be only 14 people, but it will be on the basis of at least two-thirds of the members of the jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Solicitor-General and the Minister have given thought and consideration to the matter and that they will not tell us, get again, and for the third time running, that the issue has been subject to an investigation which the Government are urgently pursuing and that about July or August, when the shooting season starts, a document will be brought before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I fear that the Government will not say that; perhaps that would be the happiest outcome I could have hoped for. However, the Government must have thought about their views on the problem and I hope that they will say "Yes, that should be done. Yes, it is time that it was done. Here is an opportunity to do it. Let us do it and so recommend to the House of Commons and the Law Commission."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kit kind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman indicated that he hoped that the Government would not say that the matter would not be subject to a future investigation. I shall not say that, because it has been subject to a past one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman confessed that he had not considered the report of the Thomson committee. With apologies to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), the Thomson committee looked at the issue. It was raised before. The Thomson committee reported in its evidence that the overwhelming weight of evidence was that the bare majority verdict should be retained. That was not only the overwhelming weight of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1581</span>
evidence before the committee but the alarming view of the committee itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Thomson committee pointed to two significant aspects where the law of Scotland is different from that south of the border. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, there is the "not proven" verdict as an alternative verdict to either "guilty" or "not guilty". That does not exist south of the border. It is a verdict of acquittal and it is available to the juror in Scotland who has a doubt.

I emphasise at this stage that for a verdict of "guilty" to be sufficient, it is not sufficient that there be more people wishing a guilty verdict that any other verdict; there have to be at least eight people giving a verdict of "guilty" before the accused is convicted. Therefore, if seven voted "guilty" and five "not guilty" and three "not proven", that would not be sufficient to convict the accused. Whether other jurors come to a "not proven" or "not guilty" verdict, at least over half the jury must be satisfied that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt before the verdict is one that will result in a conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point to which the Thomson committee referred, which is also relevant, is that in Scotland, unlike south of the border, there is the requirement of corroboration before a verdict of "guilty" can be even contemplated by the jury. Unless the judge is satisfied that the evidence in law would permit the jury to return a verdict of guilty—and for that he must be satisfied that there is corroboration of all material matters—the jury cannot be permitted to return a verdict of guilty. That is an additional safeguard that does not exist south of the border, where the legal requirement for a corroboration is not the same as that which we have known for many years in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the Thomson committee recommended—and the Government see no reason to depart from the committee's recommendation—that the existing system has stood the test of time. It has not led to any great sense of injustice that has been put down before the Thomson committee or the Government at any time. It is not a matter which has even given rise to any great feeling for the need to reform. We all know many other areas of the law and of court procedure where there have been many representations and powerful cases have been argued.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1582</span>
This system on the other hand, has stood the test of time extremely well and no evidence has been presented to the Government of the day, the Government of any other time or the Thomson Committee to indicate that a change of this kind would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore that the hon. Gentleman will not press the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary. I had hoped that I had evaded the Thomson trap but I have not. The point about evidence to the Thomson committee is that it was not so much evidence as views. There was very little practical evidence. There was no analysis of any kind. I am not even sure what kind of analysis could be made. What the Under-Secretary is saying is that a body of opinion, particularly those concerned with the law, said "Leave things as they are." I do not find that satisfactory, so I reject 	<i>in toto</i> the Thomson views in so far as they are based on that kind of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second kind of evidence is that it has stood the test of time and that there have been very few objections to it. There has been little objection to lawyers wearing wigs but in the next new clause we aim to change precisely that. Many things stand the test of time but for various reasons they go unchallenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, women working in pits stood the test of time, as did small boys going up chimneys in country houses. We were told in this very House of Commons that if the practice of small boys climbing up chimneys were to be abolished, no country house would be safe from fire. But the practice was abolished.

This is a very difficult problem to thrash out on every occasion, but I have had it raised with me by solicitors sheerly on the logic and indefensibility of a verdict which should clear away any reasonable doubt being on a basis of eight to seven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

eight to seven verdict. It is extremely difficult, as I am sure my hon. Friend will accept, to explain to them that although they have been convicted by a majority of only eight to seven, they have no possible ground for appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the doubt implicit in eight to seven cannot be challenged in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question that it could be kept, I found that an extraordinary view—that the eight-seven verdict did not mean eight-seven, it meant that eight found "guilty", four "not guilty" and three "not proven". But, of course, that still remains eight-seven—only eight out of 15 were prepared to say that a man was "guilty". The three or two, or whatever the number, out of seven who say "not proven" are not relevant to the fact that only eight of the 15 are prepared to swear that the man is guilty—he can be sent away for very long periods, and it would be wrong on a hanging charge, for he could be hanged. It can still lead to an intolerable length of imprisonment. A man by definition may be guilty, but there is a quantifiable doubt—it is shown by an eight to seven or a seven to eight verdict. That is quite wrong. It should be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, it is argued that we have the law of corroboration. But the point about corroboration is that it is a necessary safeguard, particularly for the innocent —indeed, for all citizens—and we cherish it in Scotland. But that the evidence must be corroborated by definition means that when the case proceeds to trial it is on a stronger basis of evidence that with the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>single testimony, which is admissible in an English court. That is an argument against the eight-seven verdict, not for it. In spite of the care we have taken to ensure that the evidence is corroborated—given the corroborated evidence which is necessary in Scotland—even then a man can face an eight to seven verdict and be found guilty. It is an argument against the possibility of an eight to seven—not an argument for it.</p>
	<p>I appeal to the harmony and unity which has existed in the Committee for most of the day and on most occasions. I appeal to the advocates, who must be aware of the problems that this causes, and I appeal to the laymen and to the man of justice, the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), whom I have written about recently and who therefore should be on my side. The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) inevitably is torn about tampering with Scottish law. He is not torn; he is on the side of justice.</p>

	<p>The verdict we have just had is interesting. There were at least two not provens— perhaps three—and there are another two or three who "will nae tell", in the words of Willie Ross.</p>
	<p>On a memorable occasion in the Committee we voted against an act of adjournal, to the immense horror of the Solicitor-General, who accused us of having voted against 600 years of Scottish legal history, because the first act of adjournal was in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1585</span>
1457. That made it 500 years to legal history by my reckoning, rather than 600, but the point remains the same. If many members of the Committee are prepared to vote on a legal element as old as that, then they can surely vote now against a spurious and recent modern development in Scottish and British legal practice.</p>
	<p>There is a serious element in this and a comic element. The comic element is the thought that middle-aged gentlemen, such as the Solicitor-General, get pleasure from seeing themselves dressed in drag. I understand that on at least one occasion he wore the full-bottomed wig. This I should like to see. It is a nonsensical situation. There is no legal requirement, as I understand it. There is no great historical tradition involved. They like to wear a wig—or some of them do, but by no means all of them— so that they can be differentiated from the rest of those in the court, that is to say, from the poor witnesses and the poor accused, who is met with—to use a term which I will deal with shortly—the full dignity of the law.</p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>As we all know, the wig was first brought in as an article of fashion after the Restoration in reaction against the crop-haired Puritans. There is no evidence of the wig having being introduced earlier. They also wore interesting garments such as coifs with little bits of white silk tied under their chin, sometimes with ribbons dangling so that they could be attached to their gowns, but no wig. The wig was brought in as a Restoration reaction to the good, plain John Doe citizens of the Puritan Commonwealth, the Diggers— and the Levellers. That was why the wig was brought in.</p>
	<p>When the wig began to go out of fashion, they kept it. I am trying to find the phrase with which they defended the retention of the wig. When the fashion changed in 1720 the judges, whose wigs had as yet no special Official significance— we are going back a short time—simply fell in with the fasion of the time. But when, after 1720, the fasion began for smaller wigs, they kept to the large wigs which they realised were so important to their dignity.</p>
	<p>It says little for the dignity of the legal profession that it requires this bizarre garb in order to maintain dignity. It is of no

help to the confidence and assuredness of the witness—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Take the trousers off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland may care to do precisely that. There is, in fact, better historical precedent for his doing without his trousers than there is for his wearing a wig, because he is an advocate. The first uniform that I can locate for legal purposes was the advocate's uniform. He had to have green gowns in the fashion of a short tunic, and the sleeves were open as a tabard. So he had a wee skirt, like an apron, all in green—a symbol of virginity, come to think of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonense. There is no historical requirement or historical precednet for the wig. It is an attempt to separate the bench, and those who practise before the bench from the ordinary citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wear a uniform here. The most distinguished Clerk of the House, Sir Barnett Cocks, gave evidence to the Priviliges Committee and one piece of evidence was to get rid of those wigs. He said "I do not want a wig, I am a Clerk of the House of Commons, not a lawyer." He recognised that he was a damned sight more important as a Clerk of the House with the prestige of the House of Commons. He sew no dignity adhering to him by the wearing of a wig. He wanted to be shot of wigs for the Clerks of the House. The House of Commons, with so many lawyers, retained their wigs, but not the Clerks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if we are saying that the dignity of the law is because of the solemnity of the occasion, that is, a crime or an offence has to be investigated or an innocence has to be established, that is sufficient dignity and solemnity. But for Heaven's sake, do not make the problem more difficult by bringing together this phoney dignity and the fear that it can breed in people. Above all, let us recognise that it is a nonsensical tradition from a very bad and unwholesome period of fashion, retained for no other reason than that either they liked to be in drag or they wanted to show their separation from others.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised earlier when we were offered an olive branch from the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). It is not a part of the country in which I expected an olive branch to grow, particularly in politics. But, having found that it grows, I am reluctant to cast it aside. It is, therefore, in a jokey spirit, by way of a farewell performance, that we have decided to end our discussions on new clause 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it was the same hon. Member who complained earlier, in our more serious deliberations, about the lack of visibility of the Solicitor-General on certain sunny days. If he had been present at the High Court in Stirling last year, when the Solicitor-General was in full-bottomed wig, he would have had no difficulty in identifying the holder of that office. Long may he be readily identified and acknowledged by us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the promoters of the new clause are not aware of a saying in the law "My gown is my mandate."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Manhood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mandate. The virility complex does not come into it. The saying is not mere self-puffery on the part of the legal profession. Rather does it serve as a timely reminder, whenever a member of the Bar goes through the court doors, that he must uphold the traditions and ethics of the profession, which has taken an oath to serve the public and the law. With his gown, and remembering that maxim, he is constantly made aware of the job he has to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason I can think of for putting the clause forward is to try to steer Parliament in the direction of people's courts, where lawyers have a purely historic role to play. But that is to verge upon the serious, and I should hate to spoil the fun. I therefore end by saying no more about it, except a resounding "No."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall see the Under-Secretary afterwards, without his jacket, if he goes on in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the views raised, in all seriousness, by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I had hoped that we might have an opportunity of hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) on this issue. I find it ridiculous seeing our provosts and lord provosts still strutting around the towns of Scotland in their uniforms—their gowns and cocked hats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reminds me of the serious point that I wish to make. The district courts were preceded by the burgh courts, and in the burgh courts the magistrates—the baillies—used to turn up in their gowns and, occasionally, in their cocked hats as well. But, following the change to district courts, the magistrates now no longer turn up in any such regalia. They turn up in their normal day clothes. Is there any less effectiveness in the district courts now than there was in the burgh courts before? That argument ought to be answered by the Solicitor-General, who is of course, the only hon. Member on the Government side who can reply on these sartorial matters. I hope that he will answer that serious point, as well as the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed the Solicitor-General's important legal initiative in introducing the full-bottomed wig to Scottish legal life on a previous occasion in the Scottish Grand Committee. On that occasion—I make no apology for repeating it, and it has the virtue of being true— I remarked that one of my friends actually thought that he had stumbled on to the set of a bad production of "Iolanthe". That shows the dangers of that kind of uniform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can make out—and I say this seriously—the only argument for retaining the gown is that it is a sort of crutch for legal dignity. I do not know whether a wig or a gown can be a crutch in a plausible sense, but that is all that it is. Most of the arguments that I have heard advanced have either been pompous—if I may say so, with respect to my good friend, using that term in a non-technical sense, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock)—or have been highly personal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I know one Member of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1589</span>
this House who has returned to private practice at the Bar and assures me that among the very important advantages of a wig is that he is almost unrecognisable in it. There is a certain degree of anonymity so that he can even represent constituents without people saying that he is no longer a full time Member of Parliament. That may be a matter of some interest and importance but it does not seem to me to be a really major argument for the retention of this finery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also, it seems to me, an argument that it will preclude the embarrassing, but not unknown, spectacle of a person in the witness box being asked to pick out the villain who assaulted him and pointing with total confidence to the advocate-depute. If the advocate-depute or, indeed, the Solicitor-General were bereft of his full bottomed wig and the witness was merely looking round for a likely person who might have committed this villainy, I suppose that the chances of the Solicitor-General being picked out would be extremely high. The full-bottomed wig which gives a certain spurious dignity to his presence would at least obviate that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, I think that there is some serious point in the new clause that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has moved. But I say to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn that when I put my gown on I do not think that I am clothing myself in professional ethics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my ability to maintain a reasonable standard of professional ethics depends on many things. No doubt, in many ways, I am fallible. But I do not believe that the shortcomings will be made good by wearing a gown. If that were so, perhaps solicitors should be put into wigs. The Conservative Back Benchers would not then have to complain about abuse of the legal aid fund. But I imagine that that would not be popular with the Faculty of Advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally object to gowns because I keep losing mine, and in these days of Conservative fiscal extravagence the cost of a new gown is such as would strain the cash flow of even the most prosperous solicitor's firm. On my rare occasions at court, I spend a good deal of my time rushing around trying to borrow such an object, having invariably lost mine. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1590</span>
should certainly be very pleased to see the back of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real reason for arguing that gowns should be retained is that we have all been speculating very anxiously during the last few days on what the future holds for the Solicitor-General. We cannot conceive that he is likely to remain in his present office for ever—I use that phrase loosely. I suspect that on his present form his stay will be a short one, although life will certainly be a bit duller for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has occurred to me that undoubtedly a proper and useful future career for the hon. and learned Gentleman would be in haute couture. We know that at the moment the Solicitor-General is working extremely hard in designing legal gowns, finery and wigmarilies into which even the office boys and the procurator fiscal's staff and the sheriff clerk/typists are no doubt going to be put. The scope for his imaginative initiative is endless—pageboy uniforms, typists' uniforms, buttons and bows, the lot. It is a green field that has yet to be tilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My excitement at the prospect has so far only been titillated by, I am sorry to say, some very sketchy drawings that appeared in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and which I am sure do not do justice to the burgeoning imagination of this latter day Renaissance man. What distresses me, and I have to say this in seriousness to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, is that if we pass this new clause we shall be denying ourselves the excitement of watching each year the new styles for legal clothing and legal uniform emerging from the fertile felt-tip of the Solicitor-General from the House of Fordell. It will become a name renowned, a name to conjure with—like Hartnell—in the annals of fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when the Opposition are earnestly trying to make employment opportunities, when we are particularly concerned about those people who are unplaceable in normal jobs and who are practically unemployable, suddenly we see a job-creation opportunity where we can place this poor man who, through no fault of his own, has no particular generalised talents that are useful to society. Even in the interests of cutting public expenditure we should stay our hand and consider whether there is not some virtue in retaining legal gowns and wigs for the benefit of the Solicitor-General's future employment.

It has been most interesting to me—I am sure that this has been true for all members of the Committee—to observe the way in which you have handled us in our difficult times. It has been a lesson to us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my memories, which has something to do with what one wears on one's head or has inside one's head, I imagine, is the various indiscretions—if I may call them that—which have been uttered. I am also reminded of the South Ayrshire boobs. T am not referring to South Ayrshire ladies' finer points, but, for example, to such occasions as when we were told that the staff of the Department of Criminology of Edinburgh University were responsible for training the lawyers on the Government Benches. It was clear that the hon. Gentleman concerned did not understand what went on in that department of Edinburgh University.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That did not surprise me, because in a previous Committee on civil aviation the same hon. Gentleman made what he thought to be a valid point, namely, that Concorde was economic on fuel. That sums up the position with regard to the headgear of lawyers and others. It is wise to look into why matters are thus. Concorde is a guzzler of fuel. The hon. Gentleman should have known that but clearly he did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that when talking about courts, judges, ceremonial wigs and gowns we should look at the matter, not from the point of view of the lawyers, because they themselves are well capable of making their own case, but from the point of view of the ordinary citizen—the citizen who rarely visits the courts. The majority of citizens in Britain and Scotland do not go near courts. When people go to court they should realise, first, that it is a place where something is happening that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1592</span>
meaningful, sensible and logical and, secondly, they should go there feeling that justice will be given to everyone who goes there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe that the Opposition Members who tabled the new clause are well-intentioned and well-meaning. I understand their thinking. I do not in any way belittle it. I am not trying to belittle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the public, who know nothing of the courts and who for whatever reason arrive in court, expect it to be different from whatever else is going on outside. That may be achieved without the ceremonial wigs and gowns. That may be so. I would not know. However, certainly, when one goes to court for the first time it is the atmosphere that impresses one. We should not discard that too quickly or too readily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But, if I may so say with great respect to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I should infinitely rather be unemployable, like myself, than unemployed like him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studiously avoided throughout the Bill to resort to a favourite technique of Ministers—to say that the reason for rejecting an amendment or a new clause is because there isa fault in the drafting. But I regret to say that, as we come to the end of the Bill, there is a fault in the drafting of new clause 17. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ceremonial wigs and gowns shall no longer be worn in any court proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will know that during the last war an American visitor to Edinburgh castle went up to a sentry and asked "Is anything worn under your kilt?" The sentry replied "No, Ma'am. It's all in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1593</span>
perfect working order." So the new clause would be ambiguous, and poverty-stricken ex-Cabinet Ministers who are the colleagues and friends of the hon. Member for Garscadden would have to buy new wigs, since his wig and gown are both worn. For that reason alone we must reject this major piece of faulty drafting.

If I may correct the history of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), it was much nearer my renaissance than his renaissance that wigs and gowns were established. They were establisted in a letter of King James IV. It was only put into statute by article 4 of the Courts Act 1672, when it was not James VI but Charles II who was on the throne. Wigs were not worn as a rejection of the attitudes of the Puritans. They were worn because in those days nit-pickers, like hon. Members opposite, were not as good at picking nits as they are now. Members had to shave their heads but did not want to appear shaven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and even my dear hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who has the prize for comedy, would present an ignoble sight if they all had clean-shaven and nit-infested skulls. That is why the wig was originally worn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that some still need it for that purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that some do. I shall not name them, as that would be unfortunate.

The purpose now of having a wig and gown is that it has become the distinguishable uniform of an advocate or a judge. An advocate is essentially a servant of justice. The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) asked "What is the use of a wig?" I have told him the original use of a wig; I can tell him the original use of a policeman's helmet; I can tell him the original use of a soldier's lanyard. But very often things which had a different use come to have a significance as a uniform indicating an officer and his station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why aircrew wear hats and uniforms is to indicate that they have authority in that aeroplane to do certain things. The reason why policeman wear
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1594</span>
uniforms is to show to a member of the public that they are policeman who have certain powers and are set apart. A fire officer wears a uniform for the same reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those examples may be partially ceremonial but they also have a distinctive function. If one goes to the High Court it is important for members of the public to be able to distinguish between those who are counsel, those who are judges, those who are clerks of court, those who are witnesses and those who are accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to live in a world in which the sort of Chinese revolutionary prison drag is the normal custom for everybody. Mr. Speaker wears a wig. Mr. Speaker wears a ceremonial uniform. The Mace different from the original but, nevertheless, it retains a symbolism. Yes, we can destroy all uniform. Yes, we can destroy all symbolism, but the world will be a dull, poor, meaningless place and we shall have knocked our history out of court. Let us all sit around in a circle wearing a belly band or a jock strap and dispense justice. Let us have no rules of evidence. Come down into the court, Mr. Gourlay, and take your clothes off. Let us have no reverence, no symbolism. I suggest that even the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, is wearing his trousers because they are the crutch of his dignity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The dignity of his crutch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I needed a justification for putting down the clause, we have had it during the last two minutes. The Solicitor-General for Scotland has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.

The first application for legal dress was during the reign of James VI, in 1609, and was an Act not only established for clothes for the law, but also for curtaining for certain other groups. It is now nonsense and we all know that it is. I think it is a terrifying argument that a lawyer is required to wear a gown when he enters a court as a constant reminder of his oaths. I think more highly of the legal profession than do the lawyers. I think that that is a non-Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). Until recently there was garb for the baillies and the magistrates, and so on. Since then there has emerged a more modernised form of local authority. They have sat in their mufti. They are all very cosy and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1595</span>
courts are managing very well. That is precisely the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), that the courts are a part of real life and that people should not accept to see them deposed from real life when going to court. They should not expect to find that they are somehow set apart by the authority of the wig. They are often afraid to say anything to their own solicitors. They do not know when they are going wrong, they are figures with gowns and figures with wigs—and they have authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely because of that concept of authority that I object. Why should a solicitor have authority? He wears a gown. Why should an advocate have authority? I think the judge has authority. He controls the court. I do not think that it requires a uniform in order to do that. I think that the jury has authority. It makes the decisions, but it is not asked to wear a uniform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sooner we get rid of this damned nonsense, the better. As for the argument that it is a tradition and that somehow in getting rid of this we get rid of variety and have a Chinese drabness, there is nothing more drab than judges with gowns all the same, with wigs all the same—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They even wear the gown in Africa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know, and there is nothing more ludicrous than to see someone who has aped the worst aspects of British democracy under the legal system. I hope that Mugabe does not encourage it, though I am sure he will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up the one valid point that was made and that will keep the Solicitor-General for Scotland in a job when he loses his present one. He can spend his time producing all sorts of uniforms if he likes. They can all wear different things. They can wear kilts, saris, jock straps, or what they like under his regime. Why not dispense with the need to wear a uniform and buy a gown? Why not bring back a bit of colour—the sort of thing that could be seen in Princess Street? The whole thing is nonsense. It should be dispensed with. The origin of the wig, he tells us—he is right, if of course—was the close-cropped hair and the wig to cover it. By the way, they were tinted then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we should not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1596</span>
bring back colour—bring back the tinted wig. The Solicitor-General in full-bottomed pink wig and a jock strap— what a marvellous combination that would be. Of course, they were brought in because of dirt and nits. We continue a fashion derived from the perpetuation of dirt and nits. It is nonsense.

If we wish to give the courts dignity, they must create their own dignity. It does not come from a wig or a gown. If we want the courts to have authority, let it be because people accord them authority. The Solicitor-General will not gain respect from me for his recent sayings about the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill if he says them in a full-bottomed wig. They are as stupid in a wig as they are without a wig. One commands authority only in the way that Kent says to King Lear:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You have that in your contenance I would fain call master.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lear: What's that?"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Kent: Authority."</p></blockquote>
It is that which we must get. We shall not get it as long as the lawyers can feel that they do not require that kind of authority because they are given an authority when they put on a wig.

I hope that my hon. Friends will vote for the new clause. It would be a proper ending. The argument of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) was entirely in line with ours. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) made, I thought, a joking little speech to support us. It has a serious purpose—and, by the way, what we propose would not be new. To those who think that wigs are a long tradition, I can say that the advocates in Edinburgh dispensed with their wigs in 1790 in sympathy with the French Revolution. Perhaps we may get the same kind of sympathy here, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
