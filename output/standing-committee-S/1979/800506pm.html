</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had nearly finished my remarks when we adjourned for lunch and I shall now finish them, although, unlike the Solicitor-General for Scotland, I hope I shall manage to say something more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Ministers have, during the past three and a half hours, found time to consider the matter I raised—that there appears to be a contradiction. The Solicitor-General for Scotland passed over part (2B) of amendment No. 20. He had to be forced into making a statement by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). He completely missed out the fact that a commitment was given in the other place by the Earl of Mansfield, on the matter of the officer in charge, that it would be looked at and that further points would be raised when the Bill came to this House. I hope that the Ministers have had an opportunity to consider that and give us their conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with interest that the Ministers have changed places. Perhaps the Under-Secretary is to reply, rather than the Solicitor-General. I hope that he can read a brief; the Solicitor-General has some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
difficulty in doing so. If he wishes, I can even give him the column number from which the quotation comes, but I am sure that he has it in front of him. Therefore, having raised this important issue, in terms of the commitments given by the Government, I hope that the Minister will now take the opportunity of replying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will be grossly disappointed to find that I can read, too. My disappointment is that he cannot listen. Had he done so, he would have heard me say earlier that we had considered the matter but we took the view, as did the spokesman for the Opposition in the House of Lords, that according to ordinary practice the police could be relied upon to provide safeguards in these matters, and that we did not consider that any further amendment was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>(4C) The suspected person may request to see the information being recorded on the form used in subsection (4) above at any time during the period of his detention".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the two amendments is to give an ease of working for the police in dealing with detainees, to give the detainees greater protection against abuse of powers by the very few members of the police who could abuse their powers—which we emphasise are the only members of the police we are speaking about—and to allow for democratic accountability for that. I shall deal with the amendments on the basis of those three points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have a standard form—laid down and approved by Parliament through an order laid by the Secretary of State— used in every police station throughout Scotland, the job of the police will be eased, because when they detain someone and arrive at the police station, all they will have to do will be to ask the desk sergeant or whoever is on duty at the desk for a form. That person is being detained. It is not a matter of that person being arrested, which would require a separate sheet, but a matter of a detention. The form will be available, and everybody who is detained and every policeman making a detention will know that that is the form to be used. It will make the job of the police considerably easier in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
such a case because they will know the exact procedure and there will not be different forms and books in different parts of Scotland or even in different police stations within the same police authority. The procedure will be the same, laid down by this Parliament, and that is the correct way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, so far as we are concerned, this will be another protection for those who will be detained. We have said over and over again that we are opposed to the principle of detention in the clause as it stands because we feel that it is against the civil liberties of people in this country. At the same time, if the clause is passed—and Conservative Members will probably be able to force it through when we vote on clause stand part —we shall need that protection. The amendments would ensure that the information would be separately recorded and clearly seen as being separate from other information recorded by the police during the course of a normal day, week or year. Presumably information about detainees collected on such forms would be filed separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major point is that at the end of a period of detention, whether a person were released or charged he would be given a copy of the form. It would contain in a clear form the information laid down in subsection (4). The detainee would be able to read exactly what had been recorded. He would know the time at which the detention started, the time at which it finished, the time at which he was told his rights and the time at which he was told under what suspicion he was being held. All that would be clearly specified at the time that the detention came to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as being a protection for the detainee, that would be a protection for the police. The point at which the information could be challenged would be at the point when the person left detention, or was charged. It would be much more difficult for the detainee to start querying the period of detention when he arrived in court, because he would have received a copy of the form containing all that information. If there were anything on the form that he did not like, any information that he considered wrong, he could query it at that point. The amendment would therefore protect both the detainee and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
police. The detainee would be allowed to say so immediately if he thought that the information on the form was incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another protection is that at any point during the detention period the detainee would be able to ask the police constable, who would be filling in the form as he went along, "What did you record on the form at that point?" or "At what time did you say that the detention started?" If the constable said that he had put down half-past six, but the detainee said that he was actually stopped, or told that he was to be detained, at seven o'clock, the detainee could say that he wished the time of seven o'clock to be recorded. At least then there would be a question mark over the information. The detainee would know what information was being recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that the detainee's solicitor should have access to the form, not just during the period of detention but at any time afterwards, and whether the person is charged or is released but is complaining about some abuse of police powers of detention. I have therefore stated in the amendment that the solicitor should have the right of access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last argument in support of the amendment is a most important one. If separate forms are kept, each police station will presumably file them under a separate heading. We shall not then receive answers such as that given to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) when he asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department why it would be disproportionately costly to provide information on arrests under the "sus" laws. He had previously asked for figures for the number of arrests under the "sus" laws, after which no charge had been pressed. That answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am informed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that information concerning arrests followed by no further action is not collected centrally in the Metropolitan police district and to obtain it would require an extensive manual examination of the entries in a large number of registers held at individual police stations. Such a procedure would be extremely costly, and as some entries may not be sufficiently detailed any resultant statistics could be unreliable".—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 31 March 1980, Vol. 982, c. 30.]</p></blockquote>
If in two years' time Opposition Members tabled a similar question to the Secretary of State for Scotland on the number of people in Scotland detained under this Bill and received that sort of answer—that the Secretary of State could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
not provide information on the number of people detained but not charged, as opposed to those who had been charged, because the police were incapable of getting that information as they would have to search through all sorts of different records and books—we should be very disturbed. It would be a desertion of the democratic principles of accountability that Members of Parliament should have access to such information when they are passing this sort of legislation through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would at least mean that all these detainees would be recorded on a form separately from any other recording done in police stations and kept separately there. Each chief constable would find it easy, if the Secretary of State asked for the information, to ask each police station to give him the figures. That would be a very important matter for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members might agree with my other arguments for the amendment. It will help the police to do their job and it will give them some protection against accusations of abuse, because they will be able to say "That is the form that we gave to the detainee. He agreed at the time that the particulars on it were correct." Therefore the amendment will allow the whole process to be eased through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention will be brief, as the Committee may be glad to hear. I do not regard the amendment as a matter of great principle; it is a matter of administrative convenience. It is an extremely sound amendment, to which I shall certainly give my support if my hon. Friend decides to press it to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(4) lists a considerable amount of information which, very properly, the police have to record when they are invoking the powers granted to them under clause 2. What is not clear is where it will be recorded and who will have access to the information. It is to try to tidy up these points in a simple and coherent way that the amendment has been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is the Glasgow Bar Association which makes the point that this recording should be done in a special book. It does not suggest a form but a special register kept for the purpose. If we assume that it is a loose-leaf register, we have come very near to my hon. Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that it will be common ground
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland or the Solicitor-General for Scotland, whichever may reply, that if we are to put the police to the bother of recording all this—and it is a bother on a busy night in a police station—the information must be put to some use. It seems to me to have two uses. First, it should be available to the accused person as a record of what happened, as an aid to his memory, so that he knows exactly what is the position. Is it to be a secret and silent archive, locked away in the recesses of a police station, unavailable to the accused? I am sure that is not intended by Ministers. I am strongly in favour of the proposal that the information should be on a specially designed 	<i>pro forma</i> and that the results should be available to the defence at any forthcoming trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has made a wise point. This is an occasion when we are thinking more about the protection of the police. It could happen that the policemen are busy; it may be a Friday night at Baird Street or at any busy police station in the centre of any city, and no doubt a great deal of rush and harrying are going on just because of pressure of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances it may be extremely difficult to remember what must be recorded, in what order, and when, unless there is a 	<i>pro forma</i> to guide the policeman through. It is particularly valuable that there should be order in this way, first to ensure that policemen do not inadvertently —usually it would be inadvertently— stray into an abuse which might result in a perfectly good case going by the board on a technicality, because the details of subsection 2(4) had not been followed. We could eliminate this difficulty if we had the 	<i>pro forma</i> to guide the policeman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, as I know from talking to many policemen and sitting in court on very many occasions, the police do not remember incidents as clearly as the suspected person. After all, it is, we hope, an event for an accused to find himself about to stand trial in circumstances where the powers under clause 2 have been invoked. Unfortunately for the police, it may be more of an everyday—or certainly every weekend—occurrence, and looking back they will find it difficult to recollect exactly what took place and in what order events occurred. In those circumstances, it is important that the police have the record
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one disputes that a record should exist, because it is the crux of subsection (4) as drafted. We ask that it should be conveniently available, and in a form that can be quickly brought to court and made common ground with the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who works in the courts in Scotland knows that there is a perfectly clear and simple precedent for this in the 	<i>pro forma</i> used under the Road Traffic Acts. Anyone who has had the misfortune to try to persuade a sheriff that there has been some irregularity in procedure in a charge brought under section 6(1) of the 1972 Act will know that the most depressing moment in court is when the Fiscal says to the policeman in the box "There would, of course, be a 	<i>pro formal</i>?" and the policeman says "Yes, indeed, there was a 	<i>pro forma.</i>" The 	<i>pro forma</i> is then produced, and the policeman is able to go through all the stages, which have been neatly recorded at the time, in an easily available form, and is therefore able to establish that the accused is mistaken in thinking that there were irregularities, or is clutching at straws which turn out to be totally hopeless for securing an acquittal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the amendment as a logical extension of the admirable intentions of the clause as presently drafted. It tidies up the situation and makes sure that there is an effective protection for the courts and a sound system of justice for those people who find themselves subject to the powers which we are now debating in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know of any policeman—I have talked to a large number—who does not regard the 	<i>pro forma</i> used in section 6 cases as extremely helpful. Anyone who thinks of the realities of a policeman's position in dealing with these matters would see why this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that there are minor drafting difficulties, and I am sure that my hon. Friend would be prepared to listen to him. But I think that the intention of the amendment is perfectly simple, and the Committee should wholeheartedly endorse it. I very much hope that on this occasion we shall have a more forthcoming and open attitude from Ministers than we have had so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a case where the Government can be helpful to the Opposition and can make the Bill a better
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) say that his would be a brief intervention. It is noticeable that so far no Opposition amendments have been accepted. None has found favour with the Government. It may well be that we are not arguing our case in sufficient detail. Perhaps we ought to make longer speeches in order to make the points that will persuade the Government that some of these amendments ought to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make it clearly understood that the Opposition are prepared to argue their amendments in great detail, at some substantial length, if that is what is required to persuade the Government to commit themselves to return to these matters on Report, even if the amendments are not acceptable now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that, although the Government have been in power for a year, their memory is not so short as to forget the frustrating position in which they may have been from time to time in proposing amendments which seemed to them sensible, only to have them battered down by a Government unsympathetic to making any changes. I thought that all that had changed in the previous Criminal Justice Bill and that there was a certain amount of cross-party wisdom in formulating criminal justice policy and trying to bring our legal procedures up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expected, when this Bill was brought in, that we should make fairly substantial progress, that our arguments would be put and that some would be rejected and some accepted. We are on our sixth sitting and we are still waiting for a conciliatory approach from the Government to various constructive suggestions made by the Opposition. If much more detailed and lengthy persuasive argument is required, I am happy to enter such debate. Therefore, I rise not wholly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) but certainly to support parts of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) dreams about the Thomson report, but whether we like it or not, the Bill is based on that report and we shall have to refer constantly to it. Thomson said that certain details should be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5. 15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government went a fair way on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
previous group of amendments to spell out the kind of thing that should be recorded. For instance, clause 2(4), which has just been amended, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and there shall be recorded—(a) the place of detention"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the police station or other premises"</p></blockquote>
to which the person is taken. It lists other things that should be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that we should take this a stage further and ask where, how, and for what purpose that is to be recorded, and to whom the record is to be made available. Those things are important. I speak as someone who is committed to this principle and anxious to make it work. But I am also anxious to make it respectable and therefore, more acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not lose sight of the point that in the past three or four weeks the facilities of Scottish television have been made available to two Government Ministers—the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Secretary of State—who have both spent some time trying, as I have, to persuade the people of Scotland that the Bill is acceptable and is an updating of the law. I have never known Government Ministers to make their case with such will and still encounter such failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that there are serious doubts about the Bill. If we do not approach the Bill with the attitude that we can make it better, more acceptable and more explicit, we shall only bring ourselves, the law and Parliament into disrepute. In the spirit of trying to make the Bill more acceptable and understandable, I support what my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden made a valid point concerning section 6 traffic offences. On Second Reading, I mentioned the fact that when people were breathalysed and subsequently charged, it was recorded. The lawyers on the Government Benches—most of whom are conspicuous by their absence at the moment—shook their heads and said that that was not true. It is obvious that they have not defended a section 6 road traffic offence for a very long time. Even the Under-Secretary disagreed with me on Second Reading. But the various stages in a section 6 offence are recorded and the 	<i>pro forma</i> is often produced in court. If it is necessary to produce a 	<i>pro forma,</i> the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
	<i>pro forma</i> is produced in court. The amendment seems to take us a fair way along the section 6 road. The fact that the 	<i>pro forma</i> acts against the interests of the solicitors convinces me that it is successful. If the 	<i>pro forma</i> in the section 6 offences has been so successful, there is no reason why the Government should not tell us today that they will come up with a similar type 	<i>pro forma</i> here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden rightly says that this is not an issue on which we would go to the stake or which means life or death to the Bill. Nevertheless, it is an issue that illustrates whether the Government are prepared to accept sensible amendments in order to make the Bill much more acceptable. While the amendment is not the be-all and end-all of the Bill, it is a test of the Government's approach to the Bill and whether they feel that they have got it right and nobody else has anything to offer. None of our arguments so far has appealed to the Government. If what is required is much longer and more persuasive argument in favour of the amendments, the Government should tell us that we are not arguing our case long enough, or going into sufficient detail to persuade Ministers that there is sense in what is being said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should proceed on the path that one gets marks for brevity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Maybe we get marks for brevity but we do not get any amendments carried. We are not interested in marks for brevity; we are interested in producing good legislation. We shall not produce good legislation if we proceed in the way that the Government are now doing. That is why I am happy to support two parts of my hon. Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the need—I say this in all sincerity—to submit the terms of the 	<i>pro forma</i> for amendment, acceptance or rejection by Parliament, nor do I accept that as part of the democratic accountability argument that I am prepared to enter at any later stage on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>pro forma</i> is a worthwhile approach, put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart, and the Government ought to accept the amendment. They may say that the drafting is defective, and that it needs to be tidied up. If that is the case, so be it. They can then come back on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>301</span>
Report with acceptable wording—they might even be as co-operative as to draft an acceptable form that my hon. Friend could table on Report—but there must be some indication of where the information is being recorded, on what form it is being recorded, the use to which the form is to be put, and who will see the form. All these matters should be made clear in this short but very important debate. We shall look forward with keen anticipation to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) I shall say that I shall be brief and I shall stick to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure my hon. Friend that I do not object to anyone else quoting Thomson. The writing is on the wall: "Thomson rules—OK." But it is helpful to have a few minds unsullied by the details of Thomson when we are considering the matter. The Under-Secretary of State is now restored to health, and I am pleased to see that—I have tussled with him in the hustings, but I wish him no ill. Now that we shall be back into gear on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it is important that the Minister gives some statement of intent in relation to the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are prepared to have a jousting match and an enjoyable occasion every Tuesday and Thursday morning on the issues concerned, if that is what the Minister wants. Alternatively, there can be a serious examination of some of the amendments which we are putting forward. We hoped that Conservative Members would consider them in detail. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), who seems to have temporarily lost interest in the Bill, said in an aside earlier today that we had not persuaded him. We are willing to try to persuade Conservative Members if we are given some advance indication that we shall not go through the Bill clause by clause, section by section, with the whip of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) firmly on the backs of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect to have differences of principle on the major issues—that is the opportunity for the jousting—but on this kind of issue and some others, including my own amendment, the Under-Secretary of State might indicate that there will be some flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
In conclusion, I remind him of what the Secretary of State for Scotland—for the time being—said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall listen very carefully to what is said in this House and even to the hon. Gentleman himself."</p></blockquote>
That was my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he produces any good suggestions, we shall, of course, look at them. I do not think that we should regard this as a sterile process resulting from one piece of advice with no change taking place thereafter. I certainly believe that my noble Friends dealt with the Bill with great skill, as a result of which it has been changed and improved in various ways."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 April 1980, Vol. 982, c. 818.]</p></blockquote>
We should like the Under-Secretary of State to give an assurance that he expects some help and advice to come from the Committee, as it did from the other place, and that he will consider some of the sensible suggestions that will be put forward. I hope that we shall get a statement of intent to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by saying to Labour Members that the Government will be impressed neither by the brevity nor the longevity of contributions from hon. Members. We shall be impressed by the merits of the arguments. If the Opposition feel that little indication has been given of a willingness to accept their points of view, they should examine the large group of amendments that we considered a short while ago. It will be seen that the major Government amendment—namely, to make the date of detention start from the moment the person is detained rather than from his arrival at the police station—is in harmony with Opposition amendments to that effect. That illustrates the Government's desire to be flexible when sensible suggestions for improving the Bill are proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I have listened carefully to the merits of those amendments and I do not believe that there is a great difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on the matter. There are two points at stake. First, there is the matter of the information which is relevant to a suspect's detention. Secondly, there is the more general question about the accumulation and future use of statistical information about detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disagreement on the principle of the recording of the necessary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
information. The Bill requires—the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) paid tribute to this— that virtually all the relevant information be recorded, that is, the place of detention, the nature of the suspected offence, and the time of the person's arrival at the police station. It is not being recorded in a secret document that is unavailable. As with all documents that are recorded at a police station, if there is any dispute between the parties—there is nothing peculiar about this document—at any subsequent trial the defence may have the records lodged. They can be examined, the police can be cross-examined on the contents and the accused can express his point of view. There is no problem about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to a 	<i>pro forma</i> being the appropriate way of doing that, I should first like to reply to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). He is right when he says that a 	<i>pro forma</i> is regularly used for road safety matters. That is not in dispute. The relevant point is that there is no statutory requirement for a 	<i>pro forma.</i> The police are not required by statute to use one, though as a matter of normal common sense and administrative convenience, it has been thought suitable and sensible that a 	<i>pro forma</i> should be used. It is for the assistance of the police, to remind them what questions to ask, and for the assistance of the court if an issue is discussed and debated in an eventual action. It is regularly used in cases of that kind. But there is no statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no objection in principle to the amendment of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). The problem is that if his amendment were accepted, it would impose a statutory requirement, irrespective of circumstances and of the availability of the 	<i>pro forma</i> in question. I am not saying that it would happen regularly, but the fact remains that, as with road safety cases, there is no argument for a statutory obligation to have the particular form of recording that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend having discussions with the police about the most appropriate way of recording these matters. We have no objection to the idea of a 	<i>pro forma</i> and I suspect that the police will have no ob-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
jection. There may be administrative problems but even if the police and the Government concluded that that was a sensible way of doing it, I would not like to see it written in as an absolute statutory obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it has never been used in that way in the past. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden, who has experience of these matters, will agree that there is no statutory basis for the use of a 	<i>pro forma</i> in road safety cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 6 traffic offences for example, will always be traffic offences, although the method of detecting them over the years may have changed with the introduction of the breathalyser and other aspects of road traffic work. We are talking here of a new introduction. We are not talking of something the character of which has merely changed because new methods have been introduced. Will the Minister not accept that at this time, when we are trying desperately to secure the confidence of police and people in each other, it would not be a bad thing to help that confidence by writing this in? We are starting afresh, not merely changing something. We ought to make a fresh start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman about the need to gain the confidence of all involved, and the necessity for the Bill to reflect that need. What is important on the question of gaining confidence is for the Bill to state clearly and unambiguously what has to be recorded. The way in which it is done is of less significance. The important thing is for it to be recorded in the statute. The statutory minimum information which can subsequently be examined in open court by the accused, his solicitor and by any person who has a legitimate interest in looking at these matters, has to be recorded. That is the important safeguard for the public. Whether we do it through a 	<i>pro forma,</i> some document or a police register on the bar of the police station is a matter of administrative convenience rather than an issue of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points of principle are, firstly, the information that is to be available to the suspect and his solicitor and, secondly, whether that information will be available
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
to the accused when he needs it if there is dispute about the allegations. I am sure that Opposition Members accept that both these points are guaranteed by the Bill in its present form. It is guaranteed that the information should be recorded and that it can be made available in any subsequent dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to road safety and other matters, and the technical point whether it should be one kind of document or another, I am glad that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth agrees that it would be quite wrong to make the 	<i>pro forma</i> a matter of parliamentary scrutiny. Such things are more sensibly dealt with at administrative levels, because no point of principle is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to Opposition Members that I do not think that the amendment in its present form is necessary as a statutory obligation. I do not object to the principle behind it. We shall certainly have discussions with the police on the kinds of ideas suggested by Opposition Members and which are in harmony with what I agreed was the proper approach. I do not see advantage or convenience in writing in a statutory form which would have to apply in all circumstances, irrespective of whether the information and the safeguards could be provided just as effectively by a different means in certain parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dispute of principle nor on the safeguards that are required. I hope that the hon. Member for Cathcart will agree that it is not necessary to have the statutory form that he seeks for a 	<i>pro forma,</i> and certainly not to have one that is subject to parliamentary scrutiny as to its details or form. Parliament is concerned with safeguards, which are rightly written onto the face of the Bill. In view of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a model ministerial answer. When the Government do not have a good case, the policy is to say "We agree entirely in principle but we shall reject the amendment." That is what we have heard so far. I had hoped that the Minister would go to the second piece of paper put in front of him—not the one marked "Resist", but that which states "If pressed".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a disappointment. There is nothing worse than apparently winning a case and then there being a refusal to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
implement to it. The Minister said, first, that he is entirely in favour of the principle and secondly, that it would be a good idea to work out a guideline—almost a sort of 	<i>pro forma</i>—with the chief constables, but that it would not be appropriate for Parliament to have its say on that. That seems to me a deplorable conclusion to reach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both Front Benches reached it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both Front Benches may well have done so. I was about to say why I think that it is wrong. In this instance, the Opposition Front Bench is in favour of the amendment. It may not be in favour of Parliament's discussing the matter, which may be an over-administrative view, but the Minister cannot plead in aid the Opposition Front Bench when he is rejecting the concept. In fact, it seemed to me that his argument strengthened the case for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not Parliament see the sort of 	<i>pro forma</i> that could be used? After all, a number of points are written into the Bill, some of which have been amended only today. We are reaching the position in which amendments that have been made to the Bill today have affected subsection (4), if not in detail at least in its wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that such changes, at the very last minute, have arisen from arguments and pressure from the Opposition. He said that some of the proposals in the thicket of amendments that we debated earlier came from suggestions that had been received. I believe that amendments Nos. 146 to 148 also dealt with this subsection, but no doubt I shall be corrected on that if I am wrong. However, the question of the time factor is now written into the Bill in a much more precise way. There have been so many changes under this Government that one cannot always keep up with them; but I believe that I have got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a change at the very last moment, yet the Minister is putting something forward as a definitive statement that apparently should be sufficient. The fact that the Government have needed to do that at the last minute shows that what was said as a definitive statement is not acceptable. That will be the basis on which a 	<i>pro forma</i> can be produced and put before Parliament for its decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
The next point that worried me in the Minister's answer—especially when he made the comparison with the breathalyser, which, as he pointed out, is not a statutory provision, so that he rejected any such provision in this instance—is that we are considering two very different matters. The breathalyser is an extension of existing law in respect of traffic offences; the offence of drunkenness while being in control of a car still remained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General believes that it was not an offence to be drunk while driving a car before the breathalyser was invented perhaps he will admit that; otherwise he should stop shaking his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous offence was what was loosely called drunk driving. Thereafter, that condition changed to one of being unfit. Now there are a number of technicalities, involving the taking of blood or urine samples and asking certain questions. That is a complete departure from the previous position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that what caused the Solicitor-General to shake his head so vigorously? I believe that we are saying virtually the same thing. The offence was there, however technical the change may have been; it was illegal to be drunk while driving a car before the breathalyser and it is equally illegal to do that since its introduction. It seems to me all the more necessary—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about whether something is or is not illegal, and not with a formula in relation to the law. I am saying that drunken driving was illegal before the breathalyser, which was a new departure of a statutory nature. Incidentally, I do not like the word "breathalyser". I have never known how it came about—I suppose it is derived from "breath analyser". Presumably this provision will be called a "detentioniser".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detention is a completely new provision —the Solicitor-General is shaking his head; if it is not a new provision we can wipe out the whole clause as we do not require it. Detention is a new provision in our criminal procedures. It has aroused throughout Scotland anxiety which should be allayed. It has brought upon it amendments which propose a five-year period after which the matter can be considered again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
In view of this anxiety, it is necessary to ensure two things. First, the information to be recorded about the individual should be known to Parliament. Second, it should be in such a form that monitoring can take place. Incidentally, by no means the least of my anxieties on this is the protection of the police. I should think that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) would agree on that because it is an extremely important aspect of this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly do not follow the hon. Gentleman's reasoning. He is, rightly concerned that the information, which is to be recorded on the 	<i>pro forma</i> should be information which is known to Parliament and the public. But there is no disagreement about that. The Bill in its present form requires that information to be recorded and there is no question but that that information will be available to the accused or to his legal representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question we are debating is not whether the information should be recorded and be publicly available, but whether it should be recorded on a 	<i>pro forma</i> as a statutory requirement or whether, in some circumstances, it would be more sensible to record it in a register book in the police station or in some other way. That is the only point that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the only point. There are two points. First, whether that 	<i>pro forma</i> should have Parliamentary scrutiny and endorsement and, second, whether there would be better monitoring with a 	<i>pro forma.</i> There is also the question of the protection of the individual and, above all, the protection of the police. Those are important matters. We are not arguing on the minor matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is rightly saying that we should require Parliamentary approval. But Parliament is now being asked that very question—to approve the information that it is proposed should be recorded as defined in clause 2. In exactly the same way, a 	<i>pro forma</i> that was submitted for deliberation by Parliament would be simply asking Parliament to agree to the particular information being recorded in a written form. That is what Parliament is being asked to do now. There is no disagreement about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is disagreement about it. We have not added to or subtracted from this clause precisely because it is possible to do it in the form that we would have if we were given such a 	<i>pro forma.</i> There is no guarantee, for example, that such information is all that will be recorded. A great deal more may be recorded. It is important that the suspect should know what is being recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the additional point to which I thought the hon. Gentleman might have paid some attention. If he is not concerned with the defence this will give to the police —we are putting them into very difficult waters with a new kind of provision—he should be concerned with the individual involved. What is important is the right of the individual, even during the discussion with the police, to be able to see what is being recorded about him. This is a notable extension of protection for the suspect which coincides with a notable extension of protection for the police. It is a matter which should be endorsed, or otherwise, by Parliament. It is a new provision which lends itself to proper scrutiny and monitoring. Indeed, it is a matter which, if the arguments adduced by the Solicitor-General are right, should help to prove the case if it goes under continual scrutiny and monitoring. That should be welcomed. For all those reasons I hope we can get back to page 2 of the brief which says "If pressed, will consider it".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Having spent so much time on the Committee with so many lawyers I am beginning to feel like a lawyer, having presented his case clearly and cogently, having had everyone else agree that his arguments are right, and having had the magistrate or judge sum up and say "Your arguments are perfectly logical, I fully agree with them" but then say "But, I am sorry I find your client guilty." Everybody seems to agree that my amendment is perfectly valid, right and correct, but the Government are not prepared to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, the matter is not just one of the principles involved in the amendment but of how the Committee is to continue its work. If in this way the Government are to reject amendments which they have agreed are reasonable in principle they are showing that they are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
stubbornly sticking to their Bill through thick and thin and, therefore, that they are prepared to be completely obstructive. If that is the way the Government wish to operate, we can just as well operate in that way. We can be obstructive. The Bill is very long and complex and we can keep the debate going for a lot longer than the Government wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it quite horrific that a Member of Parliament should actually say that something should not come under the scrutiny of Parliament—and I must call that to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I should have thought that that was what we are here for and is part of the democratic process. It is not as though we were arguing that there should be another debate. An order laid would not necessarily involve a debate. It might, but we know that a large number of orders and statutory instruments go through this place without great scrutiny or debate. Certainly, I would hope to debate some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major arguments on this matter were missed and the Minister completely missed the point. It may be that it should not have to be statutory, but it is important and vital that it should be a 	<i>pro forma</i> available to every police station in every police authority in Scotland. If a meeting of the chief constables of Scotland is called and they are told "We think that there should be a 	<i>pro forma</i>—there is no statutory obligation to use it but we think it might be a good idea", the chief constables of Aberdeen or Strathclyde will say "You're joking—we wont' have anything to do with that, it is a load of nonsense."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will say; "Rifkind off".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will not want to have anything to do with what they believe may add extra work to their police forces. Of course, it will add extra costs because there will be some printing to be done and, therefore, they will not bother with it. If the chief constables are told that there is no statutory obligation upon them to use a 	<i>pro forma,</i> there may be some who will refuse to use it. Then different types ofinformation will be recorded, in different ways, by different police authorities throughout Scotland. That will create the sort of problems I talked about for Members of Parliament trying to obtain that sort of information through questions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
to the Secretary of State when we require it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some police authorities which do not use a 	<i>pro forma</i> will say "We are sorry, we cannot provide the information—it is all there but it is hidden away." As the Minister said, the information will be there but it will be hidden away in a variety of different ways, on different forms, in different police stations, it will not be possible to dig it out other than at enormous cost. The Secretary of State will tell us that he cannot provide the information because of the enormous cost involved. That is not tenable from the point of view of Members of Parliament who seek genuine information which they require to protect their constituents from possible abuse under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, unless there is a 	<i>pro forma</i> with a copy available, paragraph (4B) of amendment No. 136 would not be operable. If there is a 	<i>pro forma</i> I presume that it will be printed in such a way that there will be a number of automatic carbon copies. That is technically possible these days—one writes on a form and three or four copies underneath are produced— we all use pads which do that. That would allow a copy of the form to be given to the detainee—the suspected person—either when he is released or when he is charged. As I said before, that seems to me to be a protection both for the police and the accused person, or rather the suspected person. That is the problem with detention; we keep slipping into the use of terms such as "accused person" whereas the persons involved are not accused—we are introducing a new principle for the detention of people who have not been accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the arguments used were spurious. Such was the argument that the police station may not have 	<i>pro formas.</i> What an argument. Surely any police authority can ensure that enough forms</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>are printed and that every police station always has them. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I agree that we are at present having some difficulty in obtaining our own papers. But the form in question will be a 	<i>pro forma,</i> which will be printed at one time and can be printed in sufficient quantities. It also means that if the printers used by the Strathclyde police authority happened to be involved in an industrial dispute and the Strathclyde police could not get their usual supply of forms, they would only have to ask the Central Region police if they can borrow some spare copies of the 	<i>pro formas.</i> That would be the advantage of having a standard form.</p>

Perhaps I should have said that the forms were not available because the machines had broken down. Nevertheless, a standard form would be available, so the argument is entirely spurious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst argument of all was that as there is no statutory obligation to provide 	<i>pro formas</i> for anything else there should be no obligation in this case either. What an appalling argument. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, we are dealing with a totally new concept when we talk about detention in Scottish law. If that is a new concept, surely the Opposition are equally entitled to introduce new concepts to protect the police and the detainee under the clause.

	<br><blockquote><p>"to enable the police to establish that person's identity".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is gloriously and unrepentantly misdrafted. I make no apology for it. It was done at speed and I can only ask the Committee's indulgence. If the principle, to which I will address myself shortly, and which I think is totally clear, finds favour, perhaps the Committee will either take an assurance from the Minister that the Government will introduce their version to effect the proposed change, or be prepared to put the amendment through as a marker which can then be tidied up on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important amendment. I cannot promise to speak briefly to it because it has substance. Its intention is to take out that power which would allow a constable to put questions to a suspected person in relation to the suspected offence during the period of detention. The Solicitor-General is leaving the Committee. I have no objection to that but I give him notice that his speeches will be very much a subject for discussion. I see that he still wishes to leave and not listen to his own speeches. I can quite understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue was the subject of a similar amendment, as those hon. Members who were on the Committee dealing with the Labour Bill will remember. It was moved by the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fair-bairn), now the Solicitor-General, who tabled an amendment to take out the power to question during detention. Unfortunately, through a lack of resolve—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
that is the kindest word I can use—on the part of the Conservatives, they did not push it to a vote, but it was put to a vote by the so-called rebels on the Government Benches. I was joined in the Lobby by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael) and by the late Tom McMillan, who had a certain independence of mind that was sometimes overlooked and who on that occasion felt strongly on the issue and joined us in voting against his own Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A long debate took place on that occasion. The matter deserved a long debate, because to leave out the right to question clearly changes the whole character of the detention period. In my view, it removes many of the inherent dangers, but undoubtedly it is a matter of genuine importance. There was a long and rather technical discussion as to whether, as a result of carrying this, the clause would be disembowelled, emasculated or castrated, in which the then Lord Advocate now Lord Murray, and the present Solicitor-General and I entertained ourselves for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside that perhaps slightly racy aspect of the debate, it was indeed important. I quote the Solicitor-General, when in opposition, in c. 145 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Labour Government's Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill of 1979. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…we want to be extremely careful, if we are giving powers to policemen to detain people and then to question them in the sanctity and seclusion of a police station …"—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 23</i> January 1979; c. 145.]</p></blockquote>
He laid great stress on the fact that we ought to be extremely careful before doing that. He did not take it to a conclusion, which I regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be repetitive and there has been a fair amount of harrowing of this ground over a period of time. Basically the clause envisages that someone on whom suspicion has centred will be taken to a police station and held for six hours, specifically—unless the amendment is accepted—for the purpose of questioning. He has, of course, the right in statute to silence and I will come in a little while to how effective that right is likely to be. But clearly the whole point is that the police should be allowed to question him in the police station. What we are asked to envisage is a situation in which the police, having it in their mind—this is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
all too human and, perhaps, inevitable— that they have the right man but not having sufficient evidence to arrest and charge him, take him to a police station to question him in order to fill that lack. They are looking for self-incrimination, for the damaging extra-judicial confession and hope to obtain it by questioning. As I have said before in Committee, this puts the policeman in an extremely difficult situation, and no doubt there will be an increase in the allegations of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a great deal of discussion during the sittings of this Committee and over the months of the Committee stage of the last Bill about Chalmers v. Her Majesty's Advocate. My view is that the law has changed radically since the days of Chalmers. One point that is certainly clear is that Lord Cooper's laments—if I can use such a word about so distinguished a judge—and his commonsense comments on the difficulties of a suspect seem to me to ring extremely true in this day and age. In Chalmers v. Her Majesty's Advocate, Lord Cooper said that when someone is taken to a police station:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the eyes of every ordinary citizen the venue is a sinister one. When he"</p></blockquote>
—the suspect—
	<br><blockquote><p>"stands alone in such a place confronted by several police officers, usually some of high rank, the dice are loaded against him, especially as he knows that there is no one to corroborate him as to what exactly occurred during the interrogation, how it was conducted, and how long it lasted."</p></blockquote>
Those remarks about the difficulties of a suspect show the need for a high emphasis and strong premium on protection for someone in that position. That still holds as good today as it did in the early 1950s when Lord Cooper laid down his judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questioning amounts to interrogation if there is an unfettered power to question. That is an attack on the right to silence in the true sense of the word. It is perfectly clear—and we all recognise—that in terms of subsection (7) of this clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person detained under subsection (1) above shall be under no obligation to answer any question other than to give his name and address, and a constable shall so inform him."</p></blockquote>
This is in itself something of a safeguard and I do not want to write this off entirely. However, I believe that in the very difficult circumstances which I have outlined it is often extremely difficult to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
remain silent. A suspect can sit in a police station for about six hours—perhaps locked in a charge room because he is compulsorily detained—with police officers going in and out and having a wee go at him verbally every now and again to try to ensure that something useful comes from it. Such a situation will occur on many occasions because the policemen themselves are enthusiastically going about their job as they see it and are anxious to obtain the information which they lack and which will allow them to secure a conviction. I believe that the right to silence is imperilled, not by statutory encroachment nominally on it, but by the fact that many people would not have the courage to maintain that right to silence and, under the pressures which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) was so enthusiastically advocating, will begin to cave in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us may have read an article in today's 	<i>Daily Record,</i> for example. It is perhaps not the strongest of evidence, but is still an interesting article by someone who was a suspect in the Bible John case and who was ultimately cleared. The article made the point that over a lengthy period of time in the police station he was constantly questioned and on more than one occasion he felt like throwing in the towel. He felt that it would be easier just to say "Yes, I am Bible John" than to try to maintain the continuing truth that he had nothing to do with the particularly horrific offences then being investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Members will say that that is not a fair argument, because fairness is the test and the court will see that that is not fair. But we return to Lord Cooper and the lack of corroboration and the fact that police witnesses are multiple and the accused is single. If we reach a position of interrogation and questioning where enthusiasm runs out of control it is extremely difficult to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about admissibility of evidence, which has been simmering away as an argument in the background in our various debates and which can now be considered properly under this amendment. Under Chalmers we had a three-stage process, a troika, for the admissibility of evidence. We gathered from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) during the sitting on 24 April that he took a fairly restrictive view of the likelihood of admissibility in a situation like that in clause 1. He said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am strengthened in this view because my understanding of the law is that the evidence would almost certainly be inadmissible if it were pursuant upon questions from the police. It seems to me, within the context of the clause, that this is precisely the sort of area where, if the police wished to use this evidence in court, they would undoubtedly give a caution at the earliest possible moment. Because the police are aware of the laws of evidence, the clause seems to me, therefore, to have within its very nature the safeguards about which the hon. Member for Garscadden was speaking". [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April 1980; c. 83.]</p></blockquote>
We then entered a rather complicated argument in which the hon. Gentleman was rebuked—the Committee will remember—by the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who made some racy and amusing but professionally snide remarks about the danger of being represented by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South in criminal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General then started talking about admissibility, and I find this very interesting. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the law of Scotland is that, where suspicion has centred, the answers to those questions in all likelihood become inadmissible. Therefore, unless paragraph (	<i>b</i>)"—</p></blockquote>
that is the equivalent paragraph in the Labour Government's Bill that allowed questioning—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is taken out, certain answers would be inadmissible in evidence. I cannot believe that is a desirable state of affairs".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1979; c. 146–7.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, at that stage he was envisaging the necessity to take out the right to question, because he felt then, as I understand the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South does now, that it would be very unlikely that any confession which was obtained would be admissible as evidence. He went on in the second sitting of this Committee to discuss different kinds of suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed his argument there in terms of that passage, because he was talking about clause 1, as he will remember, and relying very heavily on the case of Cos-tello. He was making the point that suspicion had not centred in the full sense because there was no specific knowledge of an offence, just general circumstances which might lead an intelligent policeman to smell a rat, if I may put it that way. In those circumstances, under Costello, one could make a general inquiry and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
anything that was then blurted out or that came to light would probably be admissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are not on clause 1 but on clause 2. We are at a later stage, as the Solicitor-General will appreciate. If we take his argument at this later stage, suspicion has centred clearly in terms of a specific offence about which someone has been detained, interviewed and questioned. Therefore, is the Solicitor-General right in assuming that in those circumstances evidence would be inadmissible? Is he right on this occasion to join the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South in that camp? Or might these answers be admissible? Therefore, we seem to be in a doubly dangerous situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the answers are inadmissible, I do not think that we should have the power at all. As the Solicitor-General very eloquently said in the debate on the last Bill, it is very bad to extract evidence which is then not admissible in court: it is bad for the system, it is bad for the courts, it is bad for the police. It is bad, full stop. If that is still his view, as it is if we are to judge from his argument on Costello by analogy and from what he said in col. 146 of our debate on the last Bill, which I quoted a minute or two ago, there seems to be no case for retaining this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I should love to take that position for this argument for expediency, I do not do so. It is clear that we have gone a long way from that rather restrictive interpretation in recent court decisions. If one looks at Miln v. Cullen, Bulloch or Hartley—I shall take Hartley as my text, because I suspect that we have it on the desk in front of us at this moment—it is clear that the test is not the one applied in the previous passages but one of fairness alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at Lord Avonside's judgment in the report which appears in the 9 February edition of 	<i>The Scots Law Times,</i> we see that he quotes Brown v. Her Majesty's Advocate, and the views of Lord Justice-General Clyde and then goes on to say of the test of fairness: "I pause to interject that that, in my understanding, is … the basic test and only test".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is merely a matter of applying fairness. Because the courts have been increasingly suspicious and unwilling to enter into a trial within a trial, which was introduced into Scots law in the case of Chalmers, they have decided to leave the whole matter, on the basis of fairness, to the jury and not to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
withhold it from them. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) is looking very angry about something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the basic test is fairness, which is what Lord Avonside was quoting Lord Clyde as saying, that fairness is qualified by all the other cases to which Lord Avonside referred in that same judgment. The hon. Gentleman should look at that judgment and at Lord Avonside's remarks about cross-examination and interrogation. It seems from reading the case—which is one of the latest statements of the law—that the test is fairness, but whether or not something is fair depends upon the sort of questions asked, how they are asked and in what circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. That is an extremely sound point of view. I am arguing that in earlier sittings there seemed to be a suggestion that we were talking in terms of suspicion, whether suspicion had centred and if it had, certain evidence was, by definition, inadmissible, even if fairly obtained. That is the old rigid Chalmers second and third stage argument. That has clearly been abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting article which I intend to quote, by Gerald Gordon— Sheriff Gordon of Glasgow—which makes the point that we have gone so far from Chalmers, that there is probably no evidence that is now inadmissible by definition. One must now always apply the test of fairness, and it is right that it would be held unfair if there were unfair interrogation or pressure. That is a much more open and fluid situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spend a moment with Lord Avonside and his colleagues in the case of Hartley v. Her Majesty's Advocate although I do not know whether Lord Avonside would be pleased at the thought. I do not think that this is a direct parallel. It has been argued by a certain gentleman that, because this unfortunate youth was held, or was in a police station, from, I think 2.40 p.m. on one day until 2.40 a.m. the following morning, when he proceeded to make a statement which finally gave the damning evidence that the police needed, it proves that, if we restrict compulsory detention to a period of 6 hours, we shall be in the forefront of the civil liberties movement. I do not think that that is a valid argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point about Hartley is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
that that was a voluntary stay in the police station. I notice hon. Members pulling faces at the idea that it was voluntary, but the court took the view specifically that it was a voluntary stay in a police station. But it does help in deciding what fairness is.

In the Hartley case, the boy, aged 17, went to a police station and made a statement. The rubric states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An accused person aged 17 was convicted of murder by drowning a boy of five".</p></blockquote>
He appealed against the conviction. We are told that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appellant had been interviewed by the police on two occasions. The first had been in course of the initial investigation, when the accused had given an explanation of his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The second occasion was on the following day when the accused, after showing the police where he had been working on the day of the murder, went voluntarily to Cumbernauld police office. There, at 2.40 p.m., he gave a detailed statement of his whereabouts at the material time; when this was finished he agreed to stay at the station while further inquiries were made. He … remained till 2.30 a.m. the following morning, when he was interviewed under caution by the officer in charge of the case, who considered him a suspect. After some general questioning the accused became agitated, broke down and made a full confession".</p></blockquote>
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find interesting about that series of events under a voluntary stay in a police station is what is said about interrogation. The important point about the judgment was that the court held—I now quote Lord Grieve—that there was not, in fact, interrogation. In the case of H. M. Advocate v. Rigg the court found very clearly that the nearest that the policeman in charge of the case, whose name was Samson got
	<br><blockquote><p>"to interrogating the appellant, in the sense of cross-examining him, was to ask him if he was sure of the correctness of the answers he had given to the few questions which he had been asked. In no way could that be described as cross-examination".</p></blockquote>
It is interesting to look back at what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
happened there. Samson, who was in charge of the case, and Constable Turner, saw the boy at 2.30 a.m. on Thursday morning. His purpose was to go over the statement of the appellant in detail. He cautioned the appellant he considered him a suspect. The caution was in the usual proper form. The appellant said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's O.K. It wasn't me".</p></blockquote>
The officer went over the statement to the part where the appellant was at the burn. He then showed him a photograph of the dead child and asked him when he had been there, and whether he had seen the boy at the burn. The appellant answered "No." The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The appellant was asked general questions as to whether he had seen the dead boy or any other person at the locus, or whether he had heard any cry or shout. The answers were negative. He was asked whether he was sure. The appellant became agitated and said: T did see something. The wee boy was there and somebody else'."</p></blockquote>
Then it all came blurting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from some very general questions about whether the appellant was at the locus, the only question asked was whether he was sure about the statement he had given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was held that that was fair: I do not dispute that. That probably was reasonable, given that the boy was there voluntarily. But the point I am making is that it was held to be fair because there was nothing that amounted to cross-examination or interrogation. He was merely asked whether he was sure about the statement he was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is to introduce compulsory powers, it seems that the test of fairness should be as rigorous as that—perhaps more rigorous—because one has got a person there on a compulsory basis. If I were in the policeman's shoes and I were asked whether I would keep to that narrow line and restrain myself to the remarkable extent, my answer is that I should be very doubtful. The very careful test applied by Lord Grieve and Lord Avonside in Hartley v. H. M. Advocate seems to underline the dangers in putting the policeman's situation of holding someone not on a voluntary basis, but on a compulsory basis in a police station in the hope that further incrimination will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps referring to this as a voluntary stay in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
police station. In my recollection the voluntary basis on which the young boy was there was very specious. Instructions had been given by two senior officers that were he to try to leave he was to be prevented. Will the hon. Gentleman agree that, in that case, there was 	<i>de facto</i> detention? It is important that that is established because the case seems relevant to our discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about that detail. Certainly the rubric says that it was on a voluntary basis, although I have not come across that in the judgment. It was voluntary in the boy's mind—perhaps we are now in the area of legal fiction but, as I understand it, it was a voluntary detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, whether it was voluntary or compulsory, my argument holds: had that boy been exposed to any cross-examination, no doubt the court would have found differently. I think that I am entitled to argue that it is extremely bad to put police in a situation where they are open to these temptations. I believe either that abuse will creep in or the very proper care that the court exercises will slip back and we will allow in evidence that which at present we would properly not allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that when for different reasons we have referred to Hartley—I take his argument about the extent and degree of interrogation in that case—there is a related argument? When considering whether there has been unfairness one examines all the facts and the circumstance of the case. So on a 	<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> if someone were held for 48 hours in a police station without food and water, whether he was interrogated and a statement obtained from him, clearly the Scottish courts would take the view that it had been unfairly obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A value that I see in Hartley and the reason for which it has been referred to is not that the present proposal is 50 per cent. better than what occurred in that case in terms of duration but if 12 hours, of itself, was not unfair surely that also indicates that neither is six hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we are arguing at present about whether the figure should be four, six or twelve hours. What concerns me is whether there should be a principle of compulsion at all and what is likely to happen under what we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
setting up. I accept that in the real world my worries may sound almost perjink— that is, too careful—even given that strange things inevitably occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about what the law should set down as the norm and as the standard which we should all try to achieve. I believe that the police would want to do that. I am not satisfied that it is wise to put the police in such a position and for us to leave people exposed to questioning as a reason for their being detained. I should much prefer to exercise a right to go about my business. It is bad for the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had some support from the present Solicitor-General during the Committee stage of the Labour Bill. He will no doubt remember discussing the possibility of allegations against the police. There is a serious danger in this legislation that there will be a great proliferation of allegations of irregularities and abuses in police stations. As someone who has practised, in the courts, although not with the star billing of the hon. and learned Gentleman, I have often heard allegations—many of them no doubt totally unfounded—about what goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Solicitor-General stated during the Labour Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is this unfortunate and undesirable questioning of the credibility of the police with regard to written statements, we shall get it all the more under this procedure".</p></blockquote>
That was an expression of disquiet and anxiety. Although the hon. and learned Gentleman did not push the matter to a vote, I believe that he was absolutely right. Matters are dangerous both for the suspect and for the police. The Committee should bear that strongly in mind when considering whether the right to questioning should remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person is sufficiently suspected to be detained and taken to a police station and questioned, what is the purpose?—so that the suspicion becomes a certainty. That is the area which is very difficult."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 30 January 1979, cc. 147–150.]</p></blockquote>
The present Solicitor-General is dashed well right. In those circumstances, the only reason for taking someone to a police station and questioning him is that a police officer has a suspicion and wants to make it a certainty—to use the hon. and learned Gentleman's word. There is a danger of short cuts being taken to achieve
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
that certainty. Once that is allowed to happen a dangerous set of circumstances is built into our legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to avoid that and were to remove the right to question there might still be a use for detention in respect, for example, of the stopping of interference with witnesses and the establishing of identity, and so on. There might be a number of reasons for maintaining that machinery—perhaps for the purpose of finger-printing, with which another amendment is concerned. I hope that that proposal is not carried but it might survive. However, we should remove the worst abuses—or possible abuses—if we got rid of the right to question, which might be seen, and become in practice, the right to interrogate, and which could lead to courts having considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point that I shall not rehearse but to which I shall refer. I am much strengthened in my view by the fact that Thomson, while recommending that the power of detention should be introduced, made perfectly clear—we have gone over the matter on a number of occasions and shall do so again in a later amendment—that part of his package would be for tape-recording of what happens in a police station before evidence is admissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what was said by the hon. Members for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and South Angus (Mr. Fraser), I travel hopefully, trusting that something will be written in to avoid the depressing experience of our English colleagues for eight long and weary years which, we are told, passed without action. We may get written in something to ensure that the tape recording is linked to this provision for questioning. Whether it is with or without it, I think that questioning is dangerous, and that we should try to remove it by supporting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has advanced a fairly detailed argument on the subsection but without any reference to subsection (7) which requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person detained… shall be under no obligation to answer any question other than to give his name and address and a constable shall so inform him."</p></blockquote>
Given the fact that in terms of what the court said in the case of Miln verses Cullen a police officer could require to have someone invited to a police station and ask
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
him questions without giving him a caution, he would take a risk if he did that. Nevertheless, the broad test of fairness might mean that he could get away with it and find that his evidence was admissible. I would be interested to hear his argument on whether a policeman should exercise any power under clause (2) as, under subsection 7, he has effectively to give that caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a partial caution. It was a form of caution that was heavily criticised by the hon. Gentleman's colleagues when we tried to introduce it into an earlier clause. But of course I welcome the fact that there is something of a caution there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is 16 years old, frightened and in a police station, being questioned about what one was told in a stabbing in which one was involved, and expects to be there for many hours under continuing pressure, and has a right to silence and is told about it at the beginning of the period, it may be something of an illusory safeguard. Of course, it is important that it is there, but I do not consider it a sufficient safeguard, given the dangers I have mentioned. It is a matter of balance; but I should prefer to do without the whole mechanism of questioning and compulsory detention. I regard subsection (7) as inadequate in terms of undoing the damage that may be done, although, of course, I am glad that it is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will conclude, Mr. Gourlay, because I realise that I am trying the patience of the Committee, although this is a fairly important matter. My attention was drawn recently to an extremely good article, which perhaps members of the Committee more skilled in these matters than I already knew of. It was entitled "The Admissibility of Answers to Police Questioning in Scotland", and appears in a book called "Restyling the Criminal Law", edited by Glazebrook and published in 1978. The article was written by Gerald Gordon, who was professor of criminal law at Edinburgh University and author of the standard work on Scottish criminal law. He is now a highly respected member of the Shrival Bench in Glasgow. He is also a member of the Thomson Committee, which is particularly interesting, because I detect some backsliding, shall we say. That is a pejorative term, so I will say that I detect some fairly fundamental doubts about some of the things in the Thomson report regarding the power
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
of detention. I am glad to be able to quote Sheriff Gordon, because he was being lauded by the hon. Member for South Angus as a particularly persuasive authority on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from the first paragraph of the article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A few years ago it would have been unthinkable to suggest that effectively there was no law of confession in Scotland: today I should have been guilty of exaggeration, but only exaggeration, had I entitled this essay, 'Is there an exclusionary rule in Scotland any longer? The end of an auld sang'."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) would like an historical note on the end of an auld sang with its memories of the Treaty of Union debates and the speeches of Bellhaven and Queensberry. I cannot remember and I look in vain for help from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the serious point. Sheriff Gordon is saying that we have now gone a long way from the days when any category was 	<i>per se</i> excluded. It is an extremely useful résumé. He goes through Aitken, Chalmers, Murphy and Thompson. He charts with a great deal of authority and persuasive power the enormous departure from the exclusionary principle that once predominated in Scots law. He makes the point that the great power of the courts, the great escape hatch, is to leave it to the jury The jury, can often be influenced by all kinds of extraneous circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I was particularly interested in the account of the case of Murphy. The quotations are on page 337 of the article. Murphy was asked to make a statement and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'I don't want to talk about it', to which the officer made the now legendary response, 'What don't you want to talk about?' the purpose of which, as he was eventually brought to admit at the trial, was, indeed, 'to get him to talk about it'."</p></blockquote>
Subsequently another police officer appeared on the scene—a Mr. Slipper. Mr. Slipper's line was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'I am not going to show you any statements or any signatures but I will tell you that we know about the meets in your home before the job and all the details'. Murphy said 'It looks like you know a lot about it.' Mr. Slipper said 'We do and you know that what I have just said to you is true'."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Murphy then—most unwisely—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Can I tell you my side?' Mr. Slipper said 'Yes, these officers will see to it'."—</p></blockquote>
and they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
Certainly that was at a stage when suspicion had crystallised upon Mr. Murphy. Perhaps to some extent he was misled by staetments along the lines of "We have already got statements from other people." If I may say so, that is a fairly traditional trap to set. Yet the jury— it was left to the jury on the fairness principle—decided to admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have come a long way from Chalmers. My final quotation from Gerald Gordon's article is of particular importance to the debate. It comes from an authority eminent by any standards. In the penultimate page of the article, Gerald Gordon says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the absence of any guidelines for juries beyond 'fairness', there is a risk that undesirable police practices will be encouraged, or at least condoned, as means justified by ends and by the good faith of the police in their endeavour to catch criminals. In the heyday of 	<i>Chalmers</i> a policeman may have been inhibited from pursuing his inquiries because of the knowledge that the court would reject the evidence he obtained; today he will always be well advised to chance his arm to the extent that his own conscience will allow because of the strong likelihood that any relevant evidence will be admitted".</p></blockquote>
I do not welcome the fact that we have reached the point when an eminent sheriff can say that a wise policeman would be sensible to "chance his arm", on the grounds that the evidence thus obtained will almost certainly get by under the fairness rule. I certainly do not think that we should be in the position where
	<br><blockquote><p>"undesirable police practices may"</p></blockquote>
—it is only may, of course—
	<br><blockquote><p>"be encouraged, or at least condoned, as means justified by ends".</p></blockquote>
That situation, which presently exists under the law of Scotland, seems to me highly dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real danger that hon. Members on the Committee may be carried away by their enthusiasm for the law and order issue. We are all enthusiasts for law and order. My constituents worry about that just as much as anyone else, and I worry about it just as much as any other member of the Committee. However, no one should allow his enthusiasm to lead him into arguing that the ends justify the means, whatever those means may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come to the considered judgment that if we put the police and the accused into that position we shall be going too far. We are being invited to write into the statute a particularly dangerous provision.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
However admirable the intentions as regards catching the guilty may be, that provision cannot be justified in terms of protecting society as a whole and ensuring that the law of Scotland is seen to be fair and seen to be giving proper protection to all those who may be at risk. I hope that the Committee will look upon the amendment kindly, and that the Government may be prevailed upon to take out the power that would allow members of the police force to take people for questioning to police stations when suspicion has crystallised. That power is foreign to our traditions. It is dangerous. In his heart of hearts, I think that the Solicitor-General would agree with that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal briefly with one or two points. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to my earlier comments, but it seems that while everybody is worried about the question of admissibility and fairness and some of us have thought that the law has been progressing in the wrong direction, his amendment is doing nothing to solve this position. After all, his amendment is dealing with a new power and he said that if this new power to detain is given to the police and is exercised, there should be no questioning. But we all know that the form of questioning which the law allows takes place at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the Bill is that were the police to find themselves in the position in which he is trying to set them, they could decide not to use the detention power and could go back to inviting someone to come down to the police station to help them so that they could conduct their questioning as they do at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is that in presenting the amendment at this stage the hon. Gentleman will be removing the benefits and safeguards for accused people which, in a way, this power provides for them. I now see, as I did not see this morning, why he thought that four hours' detention was enough, because if all the police are able to do is to ask persons their names and addresses, take their fingerprints and search them, I should have thought their four hours would be excessive for that. The obvious reason for having a time limit is to allow the police to do a little more than that. To pursue their inquiries is a vital and important part of this particular power,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
and anything that diminishes their ability to use it is dangerous, in my belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden referred to the speech I made earlier and read out one part of it. In fairness to me, I believe that he might have read out the whole of that passage, because it ties together. I was speaking about the position once suspicion had centerd, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the evidence would in all likelihood, unless it was spontaneous, be inadmissible".</p></blockquote>
It was after that that I went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"my understanding of the law is that the evidence"</p></blockquote>
—that is, that sort of evidence—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would almost certainly be inadmissible if it were pursuant upon questions from the police". —[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April 1980; c. 83.]</p></blockquote>
I still stand by that. I find that in the case of Rigg, to which the hon. Member for Garscadden referred, one of the reasons why the statement in Rigg was found to be inadmissible was that its spontaneity was in doubt because of its length, which suggested that it could only have been adduced as a result of certain questions having been asked. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the statement of the law which I gave is a tenable statement in view of the authorities that there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to re-emphasise what I tried to say in an intervention in his speech. There is no question, to my mind, but that under clause 2(5)(	<i>a</i>), which allows a policeman to
	<br><blockquote><p>"put questions to him in relation to the suspected offence".</p></blockquote>
there is nothing that will allow anything to happen which does not happen at present, or any interrogation or cross-examination. If the hon. Gentleman will read the case of Hartley and all the statements by judges made in it, he will find that it is very much on all fours with that. An excerpt from that case reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The appellant agreed to stay at the station while further inquiries were made. In fact, two senior officers, Samson and Cowie, had instructed that the appellant should be kept at the station".</p></blockquote>
Whatever view the Committee may take of that, Lord Grieve, in his judgement of that case which appears on page 30 of the report, went on to compare Hartley and Rigg and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is some similarity in the facts of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
two cases, in so far as both the accused in Rigg's case and the appellant in this case were 17 years of age and were detained in a police station for a prolonged period before making an incriminating statement".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the rules that Hartley applies of what evidence is admissible or inadmissible provide the sort of safeguards that the hon. Member for Garscadden is looking for. Lord Avonside defines what he means by cross-examination and interrogation. Commenting on the case of Chalmers he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"police officers may question a subject so long as they do not stray into the field of interrogation. Secondly, and most importantly, cross-examination is just what it means. It consists in questioning an adverse witness in an effort to break down his evidence, to weaken or prejudice his evidence, or to elicit statements damaging to him and aiding the case of the cross-examiner".</p></blockquote>
I believe that these safeguards which the law at present allows are right. I should be far more worried about this power of detention if I thought that there was anything in it which would diminish those safeguards. But the most important words—and, to my surprise, the words being removed above all by the amendment —are the words in the proviso in this subsection, which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that this paragraph shall be without prejudice to any existing rule of law as regards the admissibility in evidence of any answer given".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the safeguards which exist in the law at the moment, which I believe we see in Hartley, are being brought over lock, stock and barrel into this claiuse. Were it not for this proviso, I should not have felt so easy about it, but in view of the proviso I believe that the amendment of the hon. Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to intervene in the debate, and certainly I shall not get involved in the debate about the admissibility or inadmissibility of evidence, but something that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said has provoked me to rise to my feet, albeit briefly. I hope that when the Minister replies he will not allow the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South to go unanswered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When taking up the point put by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) this morning on the question whether it should be four hours' or six hours' detention, the hon. Member for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
Edinburgh South said—I am not misquoting him—that he did not understand this morning why my hon. Friend was in favour of four hours as opposed to six hours but that he understood now. He said that my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden thinks that all that the police are entitled to do is to ask for the name and address and take finger-prints, palm-prints or any other prints. Again I quote the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, who said "But he knows"—referring to my hon. Friend—"that the police will want to do much more."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if the Under-Secretary replies to this debate he will make abundantly clear to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South what the police can do under the Bill. It is clearly spelt out in the Bill. Indeed, in proposing and passing an amendment earlier today, the Minister went to some lengths to spell out in subsection (7), as was mentioned by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), that not only had the police to make it clear to the suspect that he needed to give only his name and address and to answer no other questions; the Government have gone a stage further today. They say in their amendment that the police have to give that warning of caution not only once but twice—first at the point of detention and secondly at the point of arrival at the police station. There is a great danger that during these debates things will slip in which will be almost accepted because they go unanswered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will take up his hon. Friend's point and make it abundantly clear that what can be done is spelt out in the statute, that the conditions and circumstances in which it can be done are also spelt out, and that they can do no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content to leave my remarks at that, because no doubt the Minister will want to clear that point up.

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was correct in pointing out that the whole tenor of the comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) were not so much in opposition to what the Government are proposing but in opposition to the whole trend and development of the law since the case of Chalmers to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the sort of questioning which the police, under the present rules of admissibility and fairness of questioning, can make and have made for many years are rules which have developed since Chalmers. The hon. Gentleman was largely suggesting that he would like to go back to a Chalmers situation in which the law had never developed in the way that it had. That may be a reasonable argument to put forward, but it is not directly affected by the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will be aware, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, that the Bill includes a specific proviso, making it clear beyond any misunderstanding that the existing rules of admissibility of evidence are not in any way affected by the power of questioning provided for under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must accept that the power of questioning was not simply incidental to Thomson's recommendations. Thomson looked exhaustively at the matter, as I am sure did the previous Government, and both concluded, as have the present Administration, that to have the power of detention without any power of questioning would make a nonsense of the situation, and would end up with the police having, in effect, less power than they have at present.

I refer the hon. Gentleman to the bottom of page 30 of the second Thomson report, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But whether the court will go so far as to exclude evidence of a statement to the police will depend on a combination of factors and not simply on whether the maker of the statement was a suspect.</p></blockquote>
In conclusion, on page 32, the committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is only reasonable that an investigator should ask questions of persons who, he thinks, might be concerned in the subject of his investigation, and that the more he suspects a particular person the more he will question him until he is satisfied in his own mind that that person is the one to be charged or cleared of suspicion. There is in our view nothing improper in the police asking questions, checking the answers and coming back to the suspect to ask for his explanation of any discrepancies. We are not suggesting

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
that a suspect should be compelled to answer police questions, or that any adverse inference may be drawn from his silence at this stage."</p></blockquote>
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the Thomson committee, the previous Government or the present Government who have come to this conclusion. I refer the Committee to an editorial in 	<i>The Guardian</i>—not a newspaper noted for its pro-law and order sympathies or support of everything that the Government are doing. On the subject of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, on Thursday 31 January, it posed the question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The issue which needs to be resolved is whether the police have the right to detain someone suspected of an ordinary criminal offence for up to six hours for questioning. The answer to that is: yes—so long as there are adequate safeguards".</p></blockquote>
That was not the 	<i>Daily Telegraph,</i> but 	<i>The Guardian,</i> which came to the view that in Scotland that power does not at present exist, although a comparable power does exist in England—in 	<i>The Guardian's</i> view as well as that of the Government—and that that was a reasonable proposal which should command the Committee's sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was debated in another place. The present Lord Justice-Clerk, who had discussed it with the Lord Justice-General, put forward some very useful observations. It was largely as a result of comments made in another place that an amendment was made to the clause, so that there can be no misunderstanding, making the proviso that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"paragraph shall be without prejudice to any existing rule of law as regards the admissibility in evidence of any answer given".</p></blockquote>
That was always understood to be the situation, but to ensure that there should be no doubt, that will be an added safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further added safeguard compared with the previous Bill. Not only is there a proviso that evidence must be taken within the normal rules of admissibility of evidence, but it will be the normal procedure, now that judical examination is to be introduced, that statements which the police wish to found on will be put to an accused at the stage of judicial examination and he will be able to comment, deny or otherwise react to them. That was not a proviso in the previous Labour Government's Bill, but it is our intention for clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
The general point is that there is no change in the admissibility of any existing rule of evidence. The comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) would be valid and legitimate only if he wanted the Committee not simply to repudiate the Bill or the clause but to go back to Chalmers. I do not believe that that is the Committee's view. It was certainly not the previous Government's view, nor has it been the view of any of those who have put forward evidence or expressed opinions on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to ask questions in the way that I have indicated and with the safeguards provided for in the Bill, is acceptable and should commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pick up that last point. I am not sure that we are getting it right. I am here as a layman listening to legal experts. I wonder if there is a safeguard:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that this paragraph shall be without prejudice to any existing rule of law as regards the admissibility in evidence of any answer given."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that we should found on that as a great safeguard. All the evidence that we have had, in the references to Chalmers and since, to the Thomson report and elsewhere, suggest that we are coming down to the very simple rule regarding admissibility, which is fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once detention is written into our structure, leading up to the final judicial procedures, most questioning within detention, if that were the only rule, would be seen as being fair. I cannot see any other safeguard that strengthens this in any way. If the Minister can indicate it to me, I should be very grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic point that I am making is that when a suspect is in detention and is being asked questions, the situation will be precisely the same as the one which exists at present when a suspect has voluntarily gone to a police station and may be being asked questions by a police officer. A whole body of law has developed over the years, so that the courts can determine whether any voluntary answers given by a person in that position, as question and answer under the Bill will be, should be admissible in evidence. The general test of fairness is one that has been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
By writing this proviso into the clause, we are making it abundantly clear that, should the courts in future need to interpret this clause, they will not be able to come to the conclusion that, because a specific power of questioning was provided in the Bill, therefore Parliament intended that somehow the previous laws of admissibility were being changed. It might have been possible to argue that, because a specific power of questioning was being put into the Bill, the courst might argue in future that Parliament clearly intended this to be a major change as regards the admissibility of evidence and that therefore they would come to a conclusion that evidence which would not previously have been admissible would thereby be admissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By putting in the proviso, we are making it clear to the courts beyond any misunderstanding that Parliament did not intend that any conclusion that they might have come to with regard to the admissibility of evidence before the Bill was on the statute book should in any way be affected by the passage of the Bill on to the statute book and the inclusion of this specific power in the clause. Therefore, the interpretation that the courts will place on any evidence which the prosecution wish to found on will in no way be affected by this clause. The proviso makes that clear and guarantees that the courts will understand Parliament's intentions when they have to interpret the Bill when it is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether Parliament's intentions will really matter in a court of law. The important thing is what is in the Bill. I am not at all sure, like Satan in Hell, that that which is urged main purpose to persuade did not dissuade me most. It seems to me that the argument that we have heard is the very argument that strenthens the case against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been saying that up to this period the question of admissibility has become more and more flexible; now it has become virtually a definition of whether fairness has been applied or not. If that is the case, I do not see what specific concrete guidelines or safeguards are added by these three lines. What we then say is that the test has been fairness, which has become virtually the only test. All that the three lines are saying is that fairness should continue to apply. But fairness will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
then continue to apply in a situation in which we have written in a new process and a new stage—the stage of detention. Therefore, "detention" is written into part of the procedures, and the test applied there means, as I see it, that, if the only safeguard before was fairness, the only safeguard here would be fairness, and questioning within detention would be seen as perfectly proper; but it would be questioning without the safeguards of proper judicial proceeding. It comes in even before clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that the courts would not conclude that questioning itself was unfair, as at the moment they would not so conclude. They are concerned with whether the questioning itself would reveal that there had been cross-examination or undue pressure upon a suspect and was not truly voluntary as far as the suspect was concerned. It makes no difference for that purpose whether the suspect has come to the police station or has been brought to the police station and has had it pointed out to him that he need not answer any questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no distinction between the two, but as the job of the courts is to interpret— the hon. Gentleman is quite right—not the intent of Parliament but the intent of Parliament as seen by the Bills that have been put into law, that is why the words written into the Bill are so important in emphasising that there is no change in the admissibility of evidence as a result of these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should feel a little more satisfied with that answer had the hon. Gentleman been keener to accept the 	<i>pro forma</i> provisions we had written in before, but he has not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has that to do with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has a great deal to do with it. While the hon. Gentleman is concenrned with the paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>e</i>), it is perfectly possible for a report to be written which would give the impression of voluntary questioning. One reason I want 	<i>a pro forma</i> is to ensure that whatever comes forward as a report from the proceedings goes down on paper and has been seen, and can be seen, by the suspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is confused. I do not think that any hon. Member who was suggesting a 	<i>pro forma</i> was suggesting that the 	<i>pro forma</i> should have the full question and answer session that takes place during the six hours under detention. That certainly is not what the hon. Member for Cathcart or anyone else was suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it has no 	<i>pro forma</i> and if a report is to be written, that report can contain what purports to be voluntary statements which could have come from a process of interrogation. It would be very useful to have a 	<i>pro forma</i> with the powers of the suspect to see what has been noted at that time. If we write in detention as part of the process, questioning in that situation becomes part of the process. Conservative Members have been saying that the police have found it necessary to do this, that it has been done in this way, and that there has been a kind of interrogation, but short of charging. Once we bring in another process, short of detention, the kind of question that could arise after charging could become normalised as part of the process before the charge. I see no reason why that should not develop nor why the amendment would prevent it. Parliament will be seen as seeking to add another formal stage as part of the process leading up to judicial proceedings. I think that that should be prevented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged in thinking that because of the speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, now the Solicitor-General for Scotland, on the Labour Government's Bill. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What a person says in a police station—even when he has signed it over a docket which says that he has read it and wishes to add nothing or take anything from it—is frequently denied by him. He may say that the policeman wrote it down, that he did not say it, but that he was told that, if he did not sign it, he would be charged with something else. If there is this unfortunate and undesirable questioning of the credibility of the police with regard to written statements, we shall get it all the more under this procedure". —[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1979; c. 147.]</p></blockquote>
The present Solicitor-General was precisely describing this procedure of detention in another form. He thought that then. I have checked on the bill; its wording is virtually identical to the wording in this Bill, but he objected to it for the very reason that I am advancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
The hon. and learned Member cannot stand on his head for ever. If I am wrong, and since clearly it was exactly such questioning that the hon. and learned Member was objecting to and saw developing, why does he now think that I am talking about a non-reality if he saw it as crystal clear, as the former learned Member for Cathcart used to say, as this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will study the record from which he has just quoted, he will realise that my hon. and learned Friend did not divide on the issue. He did not vote against the then Labour Government on the issue. Clearly, he was persuaded that it was not necessary to do so. That is what debate is supposed to be about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the courage of the hon. and learned Gentleman. He has to give his reasons for withdrawing the amendment. He argued the case. I am not talking about his amendment; I am referring to his arguments. Whatever he did with his amendment the hon. and learned Member did not withdraw his arguments. It is no denial of what he said in those proceedings to say that he withdrew the amendment. We are concerned with the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow with great sympathy the hon. Gentleman's line of argument. Will he also accept that in column 166, when the then hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire asked leave to withdraw his amendment it was "with great reservations"? I think that we are entitled to an explanation from the Solicitor-General as to what were those "great reservations" at the end of the debate and why they have been overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have silence again. I think the Government are in real trouble. I think they have it dangerously wrong. The gravamen of the opposition to the question of detention, among other things, is that we are writing in part of a judicial process along criminal procedures without the safeguards of judicial protection. It is exactly around that point that the whole basic fear and anxiety centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways this is the most crucial amendment we shall have to deal with. The answers we have had so far go no-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
where near either satisfying my worries and anxieties nor, I believe, most of the legal and other bodies which have brought forward opposition to it. I must have further answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the Solicitor-General. His reference was in relation to the unfortunate and undesirable question of the credibility of the police in regard to statements. He is saying that there was a permanent feature of suspicion in relation to police procedures, with which I think he had a certain sympathy. Indeed, as a practising advocate he must frequently have challenged it himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have the evidence this morning in Scotland's 	<i>Daily Telegraph,</i> sometimes known as the 	<i>Daily Record</i>—the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> in Scotland is clearly the 	<i>Daily Record.</i> Certainly it carries as much authority in Scotland as the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> can ever hope to do in England and Wales, and a great deal more authority with the working people. I am never facetious about the 	<i>Daily Record</i> and never facetious about the 	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i> A friend of mine believes that if all the letter writers in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> were rounded up one would have all the British reaction coralled together—and let them debate it out. So I have no illusions about the 	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the centre pages of the 	<i>Daily Record,</i> there is an interview with the man who was taken in and questioned in relation to the Bible John aspect. His description of the questioning is the sort of questioning which is now being described as possibly admissible evidence, because the test of fairness applies. What the clause does here, unless we get more explanations, is to make the possibility of that kind of questioning a permanent feature of our judicial process. That is why the 	<i>pro forma</i> made sense, to give protection. The Solicitor-General was wrong. The Solicitor-General should either answer the question or vote with us on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wait for the hon. Gentleman to answer now. Is there no way of compelling him to answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been a Member of the House long enough to know that an hon. Member can choose whether or not to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it is a sad situation when the Solicitor-General, when we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
not putting down and withdrawing an amendment but adducing a whole argument, does not answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Secretary of State cannot be preventing him from answering? He is a senior Law Officer in the House of Commons. We want an answer. He is here to serve the entire Committee and not just his own party. He is here to serve Scottish law. Some of us belive he was right then, and honour him for it. We would honour him more if he would now stand up and either amplify, withdraw, resign or vote with the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was somewhat hesitant about entering into the esoteric dialogue that was going on between my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and the Under-Secretary because it was of such interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the astonishment of my hon. Friend that we have been debating, for almost the whole of the afternoon, one of the most important amendments to the Bill, which was eloquently and expertly put by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I was able to make three telephone calls and miss nothing of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the middle of this major debate, almost all of which I have sat through and which, in the previous Committee was instigated and inspired by the Solicitor-General. Yet I have sat, and sat in vain waiting for an explanation from him of his position now that he has achieved the exalted rank of Solicitor-General for Scotland and is the Government's spokesman on legal affairs. We might reasonably have expected some understanding of exactly what he felt—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been rather lenient with the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in his pursuit of the Solicitor-General for Scotland on this case. We are discussing an amendment, and irrespective of views held previously by hon. Members, whether Ministers or otherwise, they are not compelled to reply to them. We are not discussing a timetable motion, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. If the Solicitor-General for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
Scotland refused to answer, could it be noted down and used against him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate how lenient you have been, Mr. Gourlay, to me and to the hon. Member for Rentfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). But even that excellent leniency in no way matches the leniency with which we have been treating the Solicitor-General for Scotland in his not replying. No doubt as the debate progresses he might find an opportunity to catch your eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose was not to quote, as did the Under-Secretary, an anonymous leader writer in 	<i>The Guardian,</i> because, whoever he may be, I do not know what experience or understanding he has of Scots law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend accept that, as 	<i>The Guardian</i> is printed in Manchester, the police powers in any other part of Britain must seem extremely liberal by comparison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chief constable of Manchester certainly takes the trophy—or golden truncheon—for exercising his powers with a degree of enthusiasm and alacrity which is not seen in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer the Scots press on this issue. I prefer in particular, the article written by members of the Department of Criminology at Edinburgh university. I know that the Secretary of State has tried to dismiss these people as a bunch of militants or eccentrics, but they or their predecessors have been responsible—perhaps this is a criticism—for training some of those here today. They raise another point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Numerous studies have shown that the use of interrogation, like the taking of fingerprints, is of detective value in only a very small number of cases, though the police themselves tend both to overrate and to overuse these techniques."</p></blockquote>
If that is correct—I ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland or the Under-Secretary to indicate if it is untrue—it seems that the arguments against the inclusion of this power are not only those of principle or those put forward by my hon. Friend, but that it is not effective. If its proven effectiveness is not great, it seems strange to include it when it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
causing the concern mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden. I hope that the Secretary of State or the Solicitor-General for Scotland might direct their minds to the effectiveness of this provision as well as to the other aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a lengthy debate and a number of hon. Members have spoken. We have not been honoured with a contribution from the Solicitor-General for Scotland, but I realise that he cannot speak in all debates, although it is a pity, when he has been so centrally involved in all the arguments. I miss his contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is shy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shyness has not been one of his characteristics in the past. I suppose, if one is a Conservative Minister in Scotland, a certain shyness, in hiding away from the public gaze, is politic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the reason why I am afraid that I must ask my hon. Friends to join me in voting for the amendment. I cannot be satisfied with the arguments that we have heard. We were told by the Under-Secretary of State that I wished to go back to the rigid days of Chalmers. That was the implication. The strange thing he said was that if I were to be valid and legitimate—I do not know whether I am legitimate, but I have perhaps a little more confidence about my validity. Let me assure him that I am not wanting to go back to the days of Chalmers, as such. I accept that that was far too rigid a situation, far too much of an artificial division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to the test of fairness being applied by the courts at the moment as a concept. I worry about the rate of change in the definition of fairness, but that is another matter. What makes me a little anxious about this proposal is that, despite the proviso that has been written into the Bill about the present court attitudes on admissibility—which I welcome —if we have the statutory entitlement for policemen to question under compulsory detention, given the point I made of the old Lord Cooper judgment that there will not be any likely corroboration of any complaint made, unless we get video taping or tape recording as an absolute essential part of the process, it seems to me that we are likely to get cases of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will also happen is—I suppose we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
have something called fiscal drag, but we might now call it legal drag—the way in which the courts are moving crabwise into the middistance and clawing their way from the old purities. The rate at which that is happening will, I fear, be much increased by the statutory writing in of this power to question in a police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards judges, faced with a statute that specifically says that one can take a man for six hours to a police station to question him in relation to a suspected offence, it would be ludicrous and not fair to them to be over-scrupulous about, perhaps, the form of that questioning. I do not say that they would accept anything, but I suggest that they would almost certainly, thus encouraged take the looser view of what was allowable. That would increase the pace of drift, if I can put it in that way. That, combined with the fact that the suspect is in a position of real risk, and where he has few friends in a police station as a suspect, makes me think that the whole thing is dangerous and should be repudiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, that there is no question of my wanting to condone the false invitation— if I may put it that way. If a situation exists—apparently he has drawn my attention to the case of Hartley—in which someone has a right to leave a police station because he is there on a voluntary basis but, apparently, is to be prevented from doing so by senior officers, the answer is not to change the law to condone at least part of that irregularity by saying "We are really very good boys because we are going to confine you to six hours", but by attacking the irregularity altogether. One could then say, if that is a right that is desirable—that people should be there on a voluntary basis—we should be striving not to bring in a new artificial limitation on a six-hour basis, to limit the abuse, but still build it into statute, but should be trying to make the word "invitation" what it ought to mean, a genuine invitation which can be refused and where people have a right to leave at any time: that is, unless there is sufficient evidence properly to detain them by arresting and by charging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me a perfectly straightforward and clear point of view and is one that should commend itself to anyone who is interested in the good health of the Scottish legal system. Of course the proviso is valuable about how prejudiced
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
any existing rule of law is as regards admissibility. It is valuable if we are to keep the right to question at all. I should be strongly opposed to any suggestion that a proviso should go out while leaving the right to question. But if we are getting rid of the right to question, the proviso goes with it, which is why I would take it out by the amendment. To use a cliche of yesteryear, I want it all to go, bag and baggage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attempts by the Under-Secretary to pray in aid the press struck me as slightly comic. Normally, when law reform is based on a considered report such as Thompson, an establishment—to use the term loosely—rallies to the colours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on this occasion there has been a remarkable range of opinion expressing doubt and anxiety about the proposals, particularly about the right to question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow Boroughs Association has given its point of view, which is honourable and well-prepared and should be listened to with respect. The Faculty of Advocates and the Criminal Procedure Committee of the Law Society and a whole range of other institutions have bombarded me and other members of the Committee with memos expressing their disquiet about what has been happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If 	<i>The Guardian,</i> I believe it was— although I may be wrong—came out with a rather surprising view, 	<i>The Times</i> came down on the other side. I remember the nice story of how Geoffrey Dawson once referred to 	<i>The Times</i> as an organ of the Left but not, he hoped, of the extreme Left —a judgment that most people would now uphold, which seems to me a good counterweight to 	<i>The Guardian.</i> Disquiet has been shared by a wide range of Scottish legal journals, papers and public opinion. There has been a good deal of informed criticism of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is something to be said for consensus in matters of criminal procedure and the framework of the criminal law. It is not right to make fundamental changes if they are to bring dissension, disunity, anxiety and disquiet in their wake. Clearly, there is not just what Lord Mansfield described as vociferous minority protesting, but a wide range of respectable opinion which is saying "Look, this won't work; it's dangerous and runs counter to the best interests of the current legal system."
