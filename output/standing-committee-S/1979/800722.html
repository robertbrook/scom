	<div class='clause'>Clause 13</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF JUDGES TO ACT AS ARBITERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>17 July</i>], No. 18, in page 10, line 24, after the word "Session", to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"agrees that the said appointment can be appropriately undertaken by a Senator of the College of justice and ".—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be delighted to know that I had finished with amendment No. 18. For reasons that I can well understand, the Government have resisted it. I am not entirely convinced by their reasoning, but the amendment is not one on which I would wish to delay the Committee. There are more interesting matters to come. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 10, line 30, after "may", insert "from time to time".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the payment for any senator of the College of Justice who may find himself acting as an arbiter or oversman as envisaged in clause 13. Our aim is to clarify. As the Committee will remember, there is provision for payment. My hon. Friends and I think that the provision would be made clearer if the phrase "from time to time" were inserted, to allow a certain flexibility in the fixing of rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister will tell us that the amendment is not necessary and that that measure of flexibility is already implied. He may be right. But we thought the matter worthy of an airing, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that his suspicion is entirely justified. The amendment is entirely unnecessary. Section 14 of the Interpretation Act 1978 provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an Act confers power to make … orders … it implies, unless the contrary intention appears, a power, exercisable in the same manner and subject to the same conditions or limitations, to revoke, amend or re-enact any instrument made under the power."</p></blockquote>
That provision enables the Secretary of State to amend any order made by him fixing the fees payable for the services of a senator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a point that I should like the Minister to clarify. Surely the phrase "from time to time" would be an advantage to the Secretary of State, especially in the light of the decision announced last night by the Leader of the House to impose, as it were, a policy of voluntary wage restraint. The judges concerned could be considered as among our top people. That being so, the Secretary of cerned could be considered as among our State might feel that they should set an example to lesser mortals, particularly as many imagine that judges are paid well enough already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure me that whatever policies are announced in the House —whether or not they represent a U-turn— they will extend to such top people, who could be said to be even further up the ladder than we are and who should be giving a clear lead to the rest of the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without wishing to comment on the merits of the hon. Gentleman's interesting proposal, I should say that the Secretary of State would have discretion to act in the way that the hon. Gentleman has suggested, if he chose to do so. Although the phrase "from time to time" does not appear in the clause, it is what, in effect, the law already permits. That discretion will be available to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us briefly what he considers to be the going rate for a senator of the College of Justice? That might be of interest to the Committee. As it is anticipated that the clause will come into effect almost immediately,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
and as these rates have to be set by the Secretary of State, no doubt the Under-Secretary has clearly in his mind what Lord Wheatley or Lord Dunpark may be worth. It would help the Committee if he indicated that before we dispose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that the sums paid are not paid directly to the judge in question. They are not part of his emoluments. They go into the public public exchequer and therefore, I suppose, help in a modest way to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that when a similar power is exercised in England—in the nearest example that we have—the cost of the services of a judge of similar standing for two days normally works out at a going rate—to use the hon. Gentleman's phrase—of some £500. The sums are paid into the Exchequer and it is entirely for those who seek the use of an arbiter to decide whether they think the money is worth it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is of some interest. I accept that the money does not go to the judge as an individual. The Committee will be relieved to hear that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the whip will be cracking in Parliament House as Ministers urge judges out on safari to do this sort of work in the interest of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I shall not pursue the matter. I accept the Minister's assurances that the words are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the pace of change in the law disconcerting. The Interpretation Act 1978 has crept upon me unawares, and I am delighted to have that information. As I remenber the measure, it was 1889, or some such date. With that small piece of education completed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF JUDICIAL FACTORS ACT 1849</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>In the Judicial Factors Act 1849—
	<ol>
	<li>section 5 (factor to lodge monies in
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
one of the bank of Scotland) shall be amended as follows—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>for the words "fifty pounds" in both places where they occur there shal be substituted the words "five hundred pounds"; and</li>
	<li>that section as amended by subparagraph (i) above shall be subsection (1) of that section, and after that subsection there shall be added the following subsections—</li></ol>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>The Secretary of State may by order made by regulations amend subsection (1) above by substituting for any sum for the time being specified in that subsection such other sum as appears to him to be justified by a change in the value of money.</li>
	<li>The power to make regulations under subsection (2) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument; and no such regulations shall be made unless a draft of them has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."; and</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>in section 19 (accountant to make requisitions and orders on the factor) for the words "forty-eight hours" there shall be substituted the words "seven days".—[	<i>Mr. Rifkind.</i>]</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 7 —Amendment of Judicial Factors Act 1849.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 10—Amendment of section 2 of Trusts (Scotland) Act 1961.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 38.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 22, in Title, line 27, after second "1976" insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"; to amend the Judicial Factors (Scotland) Act 1849".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 11 is seen by the Government as a technical improvement on new clause 7, which was tabled by the Opposition. I congratulate the Opposition on proposing their new clause, which the Government were happy to accept in principle. However, because of certain drafting problems the Government thought it appropriate to introduce their own new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the clause is to amend section 5 of the Judicial Factors (Scotland) Act 1849 by increasing the cash limit of £50, which a factor is entitled to retain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
for periods in excess of 10 days, to £500. It gives effect to the proposal in new clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland has observed that if it was considered right in 1849 for the judicial factor to be enabled to retain £50 for day-to-day expenses, that amount should be considerably increased in 1980. That is an argument that I think all of us would find difficult to resist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the new clause inserts two new subsections into the 1849 Act, the effect of which are to enable the Secretary of State in future to change the amount of £500 if it is thought appropriate. The new subsections also provide that the power can be exercised by statutory instrument, a draft of which will be required to be approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the new clause amends the 1849 Act by substituting for forty-eight hours the period of seven days within which a factor is required to lodge objections to any requisition or order made upon him by the account of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reserve my comments on new clause 10 until my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to delay the Committee. As the Minister said, new clause 11 is a more skilled redrafting of new clause 7. I make no bones about the fact that our attention was drawn to the anomaly by the Law Society. It appeared in the society's original memorandum on the Bill and it seemed a sensible amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, who has been extremely courteous and helpful. A surprisingly large number, certainly in my experience, of the new clauses tabled by the Opposition have found favour with Ministers. That is something that we all welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Judicial Factors Act 1849 is ancient history. I agree with the Minister that the £50 provision is archaic. But it struck me when I read section 5 that if a judicial factor transgressed and held a sum in excess of £50—presumably now a sum in excess of £500—he would be charged interest:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a sum to the estate at the rate of twenty pounds per centum per annum".</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether that has been amended over the years. It seems extraordinary—I mention this as a historical
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
curiosity—that in 1849 interest rates were running at 20 per cent. It suggests that there must have been a Government of a certain colour in power in that year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liberal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think that the Minister is wrong. I have not checked to see who they were, but I suspect that it must have been a Conservative Government. Perhaps it was one of Lord Derby's brief interventions, but I am not entirely certain. However, the evidence is beyond condradiction if the interest rates were running at 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also note that
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the money has been so kept from innocent causes, the factor shall be dismissed from his office, and shall have no claim for commission.".</p></blockquote>
My limited experience of judicial factories is that nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to have been dismissed from office for innocent or other causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his welcome of the new clause and for putting it in tidy legislative form. It is a minor, but useful, improvement of the sort that is intended by a miscellaneous provisions Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 10 fits into the scheme of judicial factors. If it were adopted, it would allow for a small but important improvement in the administration of judicial factories in the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position is difficult because a judicial factor appointed by the courts in Scotland—which could be any one of 11 different types—has powers under section 4 of the Trusts (Scotland) Act 1921 to carry out certain functions, which include selling property, granting leases, borrowing money and acquiring residential accommodation for incapax. Further to those powers, section 5 of the 1921 Act empowers a trustee generally to go to the courts if the power that he seeks to exercise, contained in section 4,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is at variance with the … purposes of the trust".</p></blockquote>
The difficulty for a judicial factor is that, unlike an ordinary trustee, he does not have a trust deed that will spell out the main purposes of the trust. If a judicial factor seeks to exercise any of the powers under section 4, almost invariably he will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
apply to the court to do so. That is a clumsy technique.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It frequently happens that the Court of Session, on a petition from the judicial factor, will refuse it as unnecessary. Nevertheless, a considerable number of those applications are made to the court. In the Scottish Law Commission's report on the powers of judicial factors, which was sent to Parliament in July of this year, it was stated out that there were about 575 such petitions over the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of making an elaborate and clumsy approach to the Court of Session and going through the necessary procedure, it is proposed that a shorter interim solution might be adopted pending a wider review of the law of judicial practice in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would operate in this way. If the judicial factor had any doubt about his right to exercise the powers in section 4, he would discuss the matter with the accountant of court. If the accountant of court approved of the particular proposal, that would be sufficient to enable the judicial factor to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary it is a small improvement. It should result in a small reduction in the earnings of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh but should mean that the administration of judicial factories in Scotland is improved and cheaper for the beneficiaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final observation of my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has given rise to some understandable concern on the part of certain of my hon. Friends. Despite that, the obvious merits of the proposals in the new clause commend themselves to the Government. I have no hesitation in recommending that the new clause be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 26.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clauses and amendment correct an anomaly which has arisen as a result of the Legal Aid Act 1979, which widened the powers of the Secretary of State to prescribe financial limits on legal aid. However, in doing so it has deprived the Secretary of State, of his previous power to adjust the lower income limit for civil legal aid—that is, the level below which an assisted person is not liable to make contributions from income. It was not intended to remove that power, which existed until the enactment of the 1979 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of the public have been safeguarded for the time being by providing under the Legal Aid (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) No. 2 Regulations 1979 for a nominal contribution of £1 to be made by certain recipients of legal aid who, but for the anomaly, would not be required to make any contribution from income. This is clearly not a satisfactory long-term solution and I am sure that the new clause, which rectifies the anomaly, will be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause arises from an initiative by the Opposition, reflected in new clause 6, which seeks to abolish trial by civil jury in the sheriff court. Unfortunately, new clause 6 is technically defective, as Opposition new clauses invariably are, and for that reason the Government, who are able to accept the principle of the Opposition's intentions, tabled their own clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone on the Opposition should respond to the invitation issued by the Under-Secretary and briefly put on record the reason why new clause 6 was tabled. I begin by thanking the Under-Secretary again for not merely redrafting but totally reconstructing the clause. I believe that I can see the kernel of the Opposition's version in one line of the clause. It appears in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>)(i),
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
which states that, in relation to the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1907,
	<br><blockquote><p>"section 31 (jury trial in sheriff court) shall cease to have effect".</p></blockquote>
There has been much debate over the years about the continuance of civil jury trials both in the Court of Session and in the sheriff court. The subject was originally considered in the Strachan report way back in the year dot. It was so long ago that I cannot remember the date. The Grant committee—which I believe reported in 1967—also considered the matter at some length. I am sure that the Committee will remember that the Grant report came out in favour of the abolition of civil jury trials in the sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequently, the matter was discussed again by the Law Society and other interested bodies. The Law Society recommended that which is embodied in the clause 13—namely, the abolition of civil jury trials in the sheriff court—and so the abolition of such trials in the Court of Session. However, Labour Members did not take up that issue, and therefore, a more modest proposal is before the Committee. The reasons for that can be stated succinctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is little evidence that civil jury trials now take place in sheriff courts. I used the word "think" because I put a written question to the Secretary of State for Scotland to which he replied on 14 July. That reply gave the figures for the Court of Session and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Figures for the sheriff courts are not held centrally, and I regret that they could only be obtained at disproportionate cost."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 July 1980, Vol. 988, c. 409.]</p></blockquote>
However, the Court of Session figures indicate that in 1977 there were five civil trials, in 1978 there were seven and in 1979 there were eight. I consider that such trials would be considerably less common in the sheriff court than in the Court of Session, despite the greater weight of business. The figures suggest that they have fallen almost into desuetude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may wish to be reminded that at the time of the Grant committee report the figures for civil jury trials could be gathered without involving disproportionate cost. It may be that the committee was prepared to expend the cost. In any event, the grant report gave figures for the years 1960–65, which varied from a giddy high peak of 21 such jury trials to only eight in the last of those years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
Therefore, we are talking about a form of action which is now, I suspect, almost unknown. That is understandable because the procedure is complex and expensive. In effect, the legal profession and its clients have been voting with their feet by not taking up the option of civil trials. I do not want to sound too chauvinistic, but such actions are—to use the Grant committee's word—a "transplant". To that I shall add the word "alien". It is an alien transplant from the nineteenth century English system which is now, I understand, very little used even in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general I believe that the jury system should be defended strongly. For example, I should go a long way to try to stop anyone who was ill-advised enough or misguided enough to suggest that criminal jury trials should be abolished. A criminal jury decides on a comparatively comprehensible—I shall not use the word "simple"—concept of innocence or guilt. The Committee will probably agree that a civil jury has to deal with much more outre and likely concepts that are artificial and complicated. It has often been said— as it was to the Grant committee—that it is difficult even to change a jury in a civil case because of artificial and contrived concepts of negligence and so on that are likely to come up in reparation cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also complicated issues concerning the appointment of fault, contributory negligence and the assessment of damages to be considered. Most of us, including myself, although we do not wish to exclude the public from the administration of justice, think that the issues to which I have referred are possibly best determined by a judge sitting alone, who has the continuity of experience which no juries can be expected to have and which cannot easily be imparted to them in a simple charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If civil juries were to be used to any extent in the sheriff court, they would be extremely disruptive of the routine and administration of the courts, which already presents a difficult problem in itself. If a civil jury trial is listed, a certain amount of time has to be set aside for it and nothing else can be cited or called for that period. Very often settlements are reached, perhaps at the eleventh hour or even at the eleventh hour and the fifty-fifth or fifty-ninth minute, with the result
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
that the sheriff and the court are left idle for the two or three days that were set aside for the full proof or whatever else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, put very simply, the system is not used, it is not wanted, it is disruptive when used and seems not the most efficient way of discharging the complicated issues which are apt to arise in, for example, reparation proof or one of the more complicated forms of civil action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, it seems extremely sensible to get rid of it. We thought that perhaps there was a case for the Court of Session. We are not sure about that, and believe that there might have been something to be said for going root and branch and extirpating civil jury trials altogether. We have decided to stay our hand and in the Court of Session it will remain an available option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sheriff court I believe that the balance of convenience and argument was clear, hence the new clause and our gratitude to the Under-Secretary for adopting the clause and putting it into good, shipshape and Bristol fashion so that it may reach the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will note, the new clause is concerned with the Solicitors (Scotland) Act. It will be appropriate on this occasion, as on the one previous, if I allow the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause should appeal to my colleagues and will no doubt seem an appropriate measure for the statute book to people back home. It has a complicated genesis, as the Minister said. I introduced a non-controversial and minor Private Member's Bill, but some Con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>

Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said. However, I believe that it was lamented only by me. The draftsmen in the Lord Advocate's office had laboured long and hard to produce the Bill and I wish to put on record my gratitude to them. They took a great deal of trouble and must have been aggravated when it seemed as though it would get nowhere. At least a miscellaneous provisions Bill presented an escape hatch, and the Private Member's Bill duly appeared as a new clause. Unfortunately—and here my gratitude to the draftsmen in the Lord Advocate's office had perhaps better be slightly muted—it turned out that my Bill had been drafted on the basis of the wrong statute. It had to be redrafted on the basis of the consolidation measure of 1980. I suppose that mistakes can be made in the most smoothly running departments. In the absence of the Solicitor-General let me even allege that his is a smoothly running department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose is clear-cut, simple and necessary. For some time there has been concern in legal circles about the delay in the operation of the disciplinary committee of the Law Society of Scotland. As the Committee will be aware, its members are appointed by the Lord President and by the Secretary of State. Its unhappy task is to deal with lawyers who are found to be in default, for example, the way in which they have dealt with their clients, or in the technicalities of solicitors'
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
account rules. The work has been delayed because the committee is small and has not been able to sit as regularly as would have been liked. New clause 14 seeks to ensure that there are adequate members on the committee by raising the limits from between five and seven members to between 10 and 14, and to between two and four for the Lord President's appointment. That should allow the business to be dealt with much more expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, there is provision to update the maximum fine that can be imposed on a solicitor from £250 to £2,500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One week's pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, one day's pay for a senator of the College of Justice, as we have discovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure has been £250 for a very long time. There is clearly a case for updating it and, more importantly in some ways, providing for regular updating by order, which does not require the inconvenience of an amending statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society's disciplinary tribunal rightly felt that £250 was ludicrous, and that where no great moral turpitude was involved, but where perhaps there was careless accounting a fine of £250 was totally unrealistic in terms of the income of a solicitor's firm. However, the only alternative was to strike at the person's practising certificate and therefore at his livelihood. There was a yawning chasm between an inadequate fine and something which might put a man totally out of business. It is to fill that gap that the suggestion has been made that the fine should be increased to £2,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some confusion. It has been urged on me that it should be £5,000, but £2,500 is a fine which will be noticed and which will represent a reasonable sanction. It will allow a proper mark of disapproval without attacking a solicitor's practising certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need say no more. The position is clear. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for his help, and I hope that the new clause will find favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate may delay us a little longer. It is undoubtedly the most contentious issue before the Committee today. I understand that in contrast to some of the other new clauses, it will be resisted by Ministers for reasons that I perhaps understand, although obviously I cannot agree with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause 2 appears a little complicated. It would extend the jurisdiction of the sheriff court to allow it to include divorce actions by amending section 5 of the Sheriff Court (Scotland) Act 1907. I could describe it as a paving clause in the sense that it does not try to delineate in any detail what scheme for divorce might follow from the extension of jurisdiction to the sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the clause relates to the machinery and procedure for obtaining a divorce. It does not intend to strike at the social grounds for divorce, which were settled in the Private Member's Bill that was introduced by the then hon. Member for Argyll, Mr. Iain MacCormick, in the previous Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
Perhaps there should be arguments about the social criteria. Indeed, much to my surprise, the Royal Commission on Legal Services strayed into that area, taking a somewhat brave view of its terms of reference. I do not intend to follow that example. I wish to raise what I consider to be important issues concerning divorce procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any member of the Committee will gainsay that there is widespread concern about the way in which divorce decrees are obtained in Scotland. There is a feeling in Scotland that the present situation is too complicated. It is felt that the system is too clumsy, and, above all, that it is too expensive. Recent attempts at reform—I refer especially to the Act of Sederunt that brought in the present affidavit procedure—have done little to cure the ills of which we complain. I notice that the Law Society memorandum on divorce described it as "tinkering" with the system. It has certainly not had the effect of reducing the costs of an undefended divorce, which are rising rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in practice only a couple of years ago. If a client who was not eligible for legal aid had come to me, I would have quoted confidently a figure of about £200 to £250 for an undefended divorce. Now he would face a bill upwards of £400 even if there were no complications such as custody and a financial settlement. I have not seen figures recently, but the average is probably above £400. My contacts in the profession assure me that that is not an unfair figure to quote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend break that figure down? The Committee relies on his expertise in this respect. Why is that amount quoted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason that the figure is so high is that there is a lot of work to be done. The question is whether that work is actually necessary or whether it has merely become part of the system but could be dispensed with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an intolerable situation. It is intolerable for the public because it leads to delay and frustration. It must be intolerable for the Government because the Solicitor-General for Scotland inveighs, at the drop of a wig, so to speak, about the amount of money spent on the legal aid fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present costs bear heavily on legal aid figures because so many of those in
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
divorce actions are recipients of legal aid. It is also intolerable for the legal profession because it gives us—I say "us" because I am still connected with the profession— an extremely bad name and forces lawyers to take a great deal of stick for work which the system demands they do but which the vast majority of them would concede is no longer necessary. That is a burden that should be taken from the profession by sensible reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of schemes "floating about", if that is not too undignified a way of describing it. First, a report was published recently by a committee that was set up by the Lord President of the Court of Session and chaired by a distinguished senator of the College of Justice, Lord Cowie, who recommended a number of changes within the procedure of the Court of Session as we know it at the moment. He suggested, in particular, that divorces which fell under section 1{2){	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>) of the Divorce (Scotland) Act 1976 should become the subject of an experiment in divorce by post. There should be no legal process involving lawyers but a simplified exchange of forms, which could be done by the parties themselves and would not involve the legal services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Cowie's committee recommended that that process should be the subject of experiment. It thought that the first category—section l(2)(	<i>d</i>), which is divorce by consent after two years' separation— would cover about 10 per cent. of all cases. If it were extended to take in the other category—the five-year unilateral divorce, if I may use that shorthand—a further 15 per cent. of cases would be taken in, making a total of roughly 25 per cent. of the cases presently before the Court of Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that this would apply not only to cases that fell into those two categories but to those where there were no ancillary matters such as disputes over custody or financial claims by or to either party. Therefore, we are talking about a very narrow band.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also had the Royal Commission report—largely by the Law Society of Scotland, as I understand it—which recommends that jurisdiction should be extended to the sheriff court. That is what is embodied in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) asked why there is this expense and how it is broken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
down. It is necessary briefly to explain what happens at the moment and why the situation is Gilbertian in its complexity and, I believe unnecessarily difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a lady is raising a divorce action in, to take an area at random, the Royal Borough of Ayr, she will go along to her solicitor in Ayr. There will then be a general discussion, advice will be given and the action will be decided upon. At that point a legal aid application may be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in parentheses, in defence of the legal profession, that some of the lengthy delays in these matters result from the time that it takes the Department of Health and Social Security to carry out the necessary investigations before legal aid can be granted. From personal experience I think that such investigations take three or four months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about the unconscionably long delay before decree is reached, it is fair to say that the first three or four months have nothing to do with the legal profession but are the result of the complicated mechanics of the legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once legal aid has been granted, we get into—I only sketch it in—a complicated situation in which statements will be taken from the pursuer and the pursuer's witnesses. These will be put into affidavit and sent to Edinburgh. They may well come back to the instructing solicitor for further amendment, and notary publics become involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Counsel is then briefed and there will be a great deal of coming and going between the three different branches of the profession—the instructing solicitor in his provincial outpost, such as Glasgow, and the WS or SSC in Edinburgh who briefs counsel, and counsel himself. Ultimately, after a great deal of coming and going, the affidavits will appear before a senator of the College of Justice and, if all goes well, decree will be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly an enormous amount of paperwork has to go backwards and forwards, and three separate, legally-qualified persons are inevitably involved. The only way in which one can escape that is if the pursuer is in Edinburgh or travels to Edinburgh to make initial contact with the solicitor, and the matter goes from there. I see heads shaking on the Government Benches, but certainly in my experience it is a three-stage process involving three different solicitors, a great deal of cor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
respondence and inevitably, a great deal of expense and delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything has to go through the Court of Session. When the affidavits are finally in order in the view of counsel and have been authorised and authenticated by counsel, there may be further delays because of the bottleneck in Scotland caused by the fact that a small, tight group of judges has to examine every paper. By any standards that is a clumsy and unnecessarily complicated arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution that I favour is an extension of jurisdiction to the sheriff court. In that event an undefended divorce action would be treated like any other civil action. In other words, the pursuer would institute proceedings for divorce. The summons would be served and if the defender acknowledged that service and signed an indication that he or she did not wish to defend the case, the ordinary action would continue like any other civil case. A decree would be taken without the necessity of any further proof or legal process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If matters of finance or custody of children were involved, they could be dealt with at a later stage, after interim arrangements had been made. That is a little controversial but it would have a number of advantages. First, these matters tend to be argued out in the sort of limbo state before decree of divorce passes. The final financial position of the parties is often obscure to the judge, who has to make a decision about the financial or custody arrangements. If the divorce went through and the arguments came later, that would result in a more settled situation in which a fairer and better informed judgment could be made by the legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will appreciate, the present position produces a situation in which moral pressure—I do not want to use the word "blackmail"—can be brought to bear in terms of the financial claims and the arrangements for the children. If one party is anxious for a divorce, perhaps to remarry, he or she is always open to that pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other party might say "Unless you make concessions you will not get your divorce. We will obstruct matters". They may not really want to make such concessions which the courts might not sanction if they had to arbitrate. Pressures might result from such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0968">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
It is a simple idea that the matter goes to the sheriff court where the action is raised, and that unless it is defended it goes through like any ordinary action. It brings simplicity into the system, which is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be said that the idea is impractical because sheriff courts could not cope with the work load that would result. I do not accept that. The only area where there would be real problems would be in Glasgow. I accept that Glasgow is an exceptional case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an interesting article not long ago in the 	<i>Law Society Journal</i> by Sheriff Principal Reid of Glasgow, who on examining the statistics—no doubt with the help of his staff—came to the conclusion that it would be possible even in Glasgow, and certainly in the sheriff court system, as a whole, to cope with the additional burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We sometimes exaggerate. There are always reasons why we should not make reforms and changes. The sheriff principal was right. These problems can be overcome. The idea that the sheriff court could not comprehend the complexities or difficulties of the average undefended divorce is such an insulting theory that it is hardly worth examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, complicated reparation actions and other civil actions come to the sheriff courts. There is no limit on the jurisdiction of the sheriff court in that respect. A case involving a ship's collision involving literally millions of pounds could be taken in the sheriff court, with all its subtleties and sophistications. The idea that a forum with that sort of jurisdiction and experience of custody, aliment and separation cases is not capable of dealing with divorce is totally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My initial contention, therefore, is that such cases should go to the sheriff court and that solutions should be found within the sheriff court framework. I hasten to say that the new clause would extend the jurisdiction but would not limit further consideration of the options. For example, there would be nothing to stop Lord Cowie's proposals about the two-year and five-year terms from going through at the same time. It could be done in the sheriff courts at the same time that the new arrangements that I have sketched were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those who are anxious to see Lord Cowie's proposals at least tried, I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
that there would be positive advantages of doing so within the framework of opening the sheriff court jurisdiction to divorce. From the forms and procedures set out in Lord Cowie's report, which are interesting and worth examining carefully, it is clear that it would be a considerable advantage if the forms could be returned to one's local sheriff court. People will become confused by them, however clearly they are drafted, and if they are returned to the local sheriff clerk one can go to him and say "What do I say to question 4? These are my circumstances".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In exactly the same way as, day and daily, sheriff clerks help, for example, executors of small estates to complete confirmation forms and so on, they could help those trying to obtain a do-it-yourself divorce under Lord Cowie's proposals to get matters right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we maintain the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Session, the forms have to go back to Edinburgh. People do not have easy access to Edinburgh unless they live there, and the Court of Session is not the place where one can go to have a chummy chat about how to fill in a form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are big advantages—even if one prefers the Cowie scheme to the Royal Commission on Legal Services scheme—in proceeding with an extension of jurisdiction of the sort that I have outlined. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we should meet the complexities that Lord Cowie met—for example, how the application, summons, or whatever it is called, passes the Signet and all the other mysterious things that happen in actions in the Court of Session. We could get rid of all that, if we wanted the Cowie experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see the experiment running in tandem with the Royal Commission type of reform. Both could be better done by the extension of jurisdiction to the sheriff court. The paving clause and reform to which I have referred would open the way for divorce law reform in either of the ways suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrap up this debate from my point of view by explaining why I think it so important. On 11 June 1980, in Scottish Question Time, I put a question on divorce procedure to the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I urged upon him that the present cost of £400 or £500 was an intolerable burden on people who were trying to dissolve marriages in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
The Solicitor-General replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yes. This is an important matter. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that, of the spiralling sum, 92 per cent. goes to his part of the profession. I do not think that removing such procedures from the Court of Session will alter that."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 June 1980; Vol. 986, c. 555.]</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that that was a particularly statesmanlike point. Perhaps the Solicitor-General was thinking of himself at that moment as a member of the Faculty of Advocates rather than as a Law Officer representing the people of Scotland and the entire profession. However, I believe that he does on occasion suffer confusion about his roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the proportion of the total divorce cost that goes to the struggling junior advocate at the end of the day is small. It may well be about 10 per cent. If the advantage of taking the divorce to the sheriff court, under a reform such as I have outlined, were purely to lop off 10 per cent. and take out the Faculty of Advocates, I might argue that, on margin, it was worth doing. I agree that it would be on margin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not really the basis of the argument. We would not just get rid of the need to employ counsel. In the vast majority of cases, we would not be employing Edinburgh solicitors to brief counsel and to act as postal clearing houses for the documentation and affidavits passing backwards and forwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, from the point of view of the legal profession, that that would mean a considerable restructuring. There would be a strain on solicitors' firms in Edinburgh and on solicitors who have offices in Edinburgh. That is a matter that has been drawn to my attention. However it is important that we consider the public good and not that narrow vested interest. So we will get rid of counsel and the Edinburgh solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has studied a tax of account in a divorce case and anyone who has read recent judgments—one or two have received publicity in this area—will recognise that a considerable difference in the amount of work and correspondence will result if the necessity to employ Edinburgh solicitors is abolished. If that practice is abolished, there will be no need for everything to be shuttled to Edinburgh and back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if one's divorce is to take place in Kilmarnock, with the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
matter being attended to there, and one trots round the corner to the local sheriff court and lodges one's papers, it will be a much cheaper, easier and simpler process, with none of the problems of negotiating at long range and through an intermediary solicitor employing counsel in the Court of Session. I do not know to what extent costs will be cut, but it would not be rash to say that there is no reason why we should not halve costs by using such a method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Block fees, for example, are laid down in divorce actions. If one considers the block fee where only an Edinburgh solicitor is involved—a case where the whole business is carried out in Edinburgh as though it were the local court—and the block fee where there is an outside agent instructing counsel, it will be seen that there is a significant and important differential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real argument is that the structure of courts would be more efficient and could give more immediate and constructive help to the client. Although I defend the Court of Session and the expertise of advocates, I do not argue for a fused profession. It is important that we maintain the expertise of the Faculty of Advocates. However, in this area its monopoly is artificial and cannot be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On every conceivable ground we should consider the clause sympathetically. In my opinion it is not defective. It is only partial in the sense that it extends jurisdiction but does not sketch in exactly how that jurisdiction should be exercised, but that is something that may be dealt with properly at a second stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing is to ensure that we get away from escalating legal aid costs and from the intolerable delay to the public. The legal profession is caught with an artificial work burden which brings it a lot of abuse and suspicion from the public. This cannot continue. It is thoroughly unsatisfactory. It borders on the scandalous that we have not yet considered divorce procedures and the reforms that are so necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that there is a crisis of morality in the legal profession. Strangely enough, it is the legal profession that is pushing for reform against what seems to be an inertia in administration. It is a crisis of competence if we cannot do something about the abuses that so clearly exist and over which there is such widespread public anxiety.

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
I recently received a telephone call from a lady in my constituency asking me to visit her. Her fiancé was waiting for a divorce. Her case illustrated to me exactly the worry and misery that can be caused. It was the simplest possible divorce. It was undefended and there were no children of the marriage, so the only dispute was about periodic allowance, which had, in fact, been agreed between the parties and was being paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting feature was that when the action started many months earlier, the lady who was raising the action was employed. Therefore, her legal aid contribution was £288, a substantial sum for a working-class woman living on her own. She subsequently lost her job and, because of the inflexibility of the system, no amendment was made to her contribution, which was not met. After months it was discovered that the whole business was in suspense because the Law Society had not received its £288. It is clear that the procedure is far too expensive and should be simplified. The result was that, as the months passed, delay grew upon delay, and a wedding had to be cancelled, with the complication that the lady was pregnant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those things happen, and I am not here to pass moral judgment. But clearly, the distress, confusion and difficulty caused in such a situation is considerable. If we were to tackle now, with courage, the whole problem of divorce law reform, we could, at least, minimise the dangers of such muddle, confusion and distress. If we do not tackle it, we leave behind, 	<i>in situ,</i> a system whose endemic characteristics are high expense and a high propensity for delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic about the new clause and that this debate will concentrate his mind upon the genuine need for action in the legal system in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, I am surprised that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has sought to introduce into a miscellaneous provisions Bill a clause that would remove the jurisdiction in divorce from the Court of Session through to the sheriff courts of Scotland. In presenting his argument, he seems to be perpetuating a myth that if divorce is simply moved to the sheriff courts
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
it will become cheaper, simpler and more compassionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole issue of divorce jurisdiction in Scotland requires the most careful examination, particularly in the light, not just of the report prepared within the Court of Session by Lord Cowie, but of the Royal Commission report on legal services in Scotland under the chairmanship of Lord Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose the new clause. The right approach to divorce in Scotland is along the lines of family courts as set out in the Finer report. I think that the previous Government indicated, in broad terms, that they, too, considered that family courts were the right approach but, for reasons, of public expenditure they were not prepared to take it. It is certainly recognised in the Royal Commission report that family courts at present are not acceptable to the Government for public expenditure reasons. Nevertheless, I firmly believe, that that is the right approach and that that is the system towards which we ought eventually to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the hon. Member for Garscadden draws support from the report by the Royal Commission for his argument that divorce jurisdiction ought to be extended to the sheriff courts. However, the important statement in the Royal Commission report—which the hon. Member seems to have failed to examine—was that on page 153:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The transfer of jurisdiction to the sheriff court would not of itself and without simplifying procedure reduce the cost."</p></blockquote>
That was a short simple statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, I think that the hon. Member would accept that I said that this was a paving and enabling provision and that one then had to move to the second stage of decision. I came down in favour of treating divorce actions as ordinary civil actions if undefended, or one could combine that with the kind of experiment suggested by Lord Cowie. However, I went on to sketch in how that could be done. The important point is that inevitably would cut out an enormous amount of correspondence arising from the long distances involved, and the need to employ one branch of the legal profession rather than three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one detail to which the hon. Member did not address himself was that of those 5,000 consistorial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
actions in which children are involved. He may talk of those 10 or 15 per cent. where no children are involved. If he is talking about average costs of divorce actions, I have no doubt that in ordinary divorce cases—two years plus consent, or five years' separation—where there are no children, the cost of the divorce is much less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complications arise in consistorial actions where children are involved. Although the number is not set out in the Royal Commission report, by making some calculations I have worked out that in 1980 there will be more than 5,000 divorce actions in Scotland involving children. It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that this is just a paving change—that the jurisdiction should go to the sheriff courts, and then we should see what happened. The Royal Commission, to achieve anything like a satisfactory solution to children, has had to develop the most elaborate scheme for investigation of their best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission suggests that all matters relating to custody, or any divorce where children are involved, should be referred to the reporter of the children's panel. We start with the premise that 5,000 cases would be referred to the reporters of the children's panels in Scotland. Then, under the scheme which the Royal Commission thought appropriate, within six months the reporters would be required yet again to look into the provision made for the custody of the children in the divorce action. I do not want to examine in detail whether that provision is appropriate, but if that is the conclusion that Lord Hughes and his Commission arrived at, it is a dangerous proposition to advance. Moving divorce to the sheriff court, without taking account of a new scheme that will have to be made for the investigation of the best interests of the children in custody, makes it impossible to say whether there will be any saving of public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the saving in that would arise from the Royal Commission's suggestion that legal aid should be withdrawn in divorce actions, the counterbalancing cost of this scheme of children's reporters must be examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is being unfair. He is assuming that a total new service, an investigation into every divorce
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
where there are children, is being added in the sheriff court. He says that that will be expensive. He is right, but there is no need to assume that that would happen. At present there is no such inquiry in the Court of Session. The court accepts statements from the parties. If the same proposal were made for the sheriff court, none of the additional expense to which the hon. Gentleman is referring would be incurred. Perhaps extra expense should be incurred to add a dimension to divorce which is not in the present system, but the hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like. He is advancing a false argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never suggested for a moment that I was comparing like with like. I said that if one simply transfers the jurisdiction to the sheriff court, one faces the problem of what to do about children. I said that the Royal Commission examined this aspect carefully, suggested three or four different methods by which the welfare of the children might be considered, and stated its preferred choice. I was pointing out that it is, inevitably, an extremely expensive method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I answer the point that I understand the hon. Gentleman to be making? In his proposals, Lord Cowie is dealing only with those cases where there are no children and the divorce is a matter of consent or of five years' separation. In those circumstances I can see that no corroboration is necessary. The Royal Commission says that there will be savings in costs in going to the sheriff court. It is tucked away, but nevertheless, the Commission makes the startling proposition that we should get rid of corroboration in divorce actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say where? I had not intended to intervene now but this is an important statement, and the hon. Gentleman cannot just shrug it off. He surely must have looked it up. After all, he is an advocate in practice in Edinburgh, where they like to keep their divorce actions. He will have had time to look up the reference between expensive actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for that eloquent and brief intervention. The summary on page 169 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In undefended divorce actions the court in place of affidavit evidence should be able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
to proceed on written forms completed by pursuers with a signed declaration that what is stated is the truth, and without need for corroborative evidence."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a fairly radical change to introduce into the law. Cases involving two years' separation plus consent are different. However, it would remain within the law of Scotland that adultery would be grounds for divorce and it seems that, one way or antother, that needs to be examined carefully. If independent evidence is required, whether that person is brought to court to give that evidence or whether he gives it by affidavit, there will still be expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is extremely interesting. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that he is making a fairly powerful persuasive case for attacking the proposals of the Royal Commission on Legal Services in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman about corroboration. Does he also accept that in its scheme for divorce in the sheriff court the Law Society rejects specifically the idea that the rule on corroboration should be abandoned and that there is nothing in taking divorce to the sheriff court that implies that one has to go along with that proposal? Is the hon. Gentleman not opposed to divorce jurisdiction going to the sheriff court? He dislikes the scheme we have been discussing, and merely thinks that we ought to have the whole thing cut and dried before we make any move. Is that his view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that that is my view. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that I am attacking the scheme put forward in the Royal Commission's report. I said at the outset that I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman set out on this new clause. If a person goes to the sheriff court and has not thought through what he will do about corroboration—the scheme has not involved consideration of what is to be done about children—what is to be done on motions for interim custody and access and such matters? How will they fit into the existing business of the Court of Session? I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman can advance any argument that his proposal would be in any way cheaper, simpler, or more compassionate than the existing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also said at the outset that I firmly
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
believe that we ought to move along the road to a family court that is wholly outwith the existing sheriff court system. However, I do not see that, by moving the jurisdiction in divorce to the sheriff courts, we are in any way going satisfactorily along that line of route. It seems that we are merely in danger of getting in a considerable muddle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one tries to stand back from consistorial actions to see what has to be achieved one sees that any scheme has two conflicting parts. The mechanism in the majority of cases requires to be quick, simple and cheap, but it must have the facility to slip into overdrive at a moment's notice—for example, when there is a heated dispute about access to, or custody of, children. Every time one considers divorce actions, one has to go back to the central point—what is to be done about the children. In the case of a young couple who have been separated for two years and who have no children, it is almost a clean, simple, administrative act to break up their union. But problems arise as soon as children under 16 years old are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finer had the right approach: there is a balance between simplicity and cheapness if the case is straightforward, but a sophisticated mechanism is necessary if consideration of a matter such as custody is required. I do not see that the proposal in the new clause does anything to assist our consideration of the right approach to divorce in Scotland. I certainly do not see that anything in the evidence or in the line that has been taken indicates that it would be cheaper. If it is to be cheaper, the hon. Member must face up to it and say, as the Royal Commission suggested, that that there should be no legal aid for consistorial actions, otherwise there will be considerable cost and no benefit to individual litigants in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The method of argument used by the hon. Member is familiar to the Opposition. When a reform is proposed the best response is to suggest instead revolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Labour Party conference, we worked diligently and came up with a motion to nationalise the pharmaceutical industry. "No", said the leadership. "Let us instead have revolution at 12 o'clock next Tuesday." The same method is used
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
here. In order to prevent a reform of the system that would be cheaper and more humane, it is suggested that we go the whole hog and adopt the Finer recommendations. Of course we want to implement the Finer recommendations and to develop the concept of the problems of divorce and families being dealt with in proper types of family courts. But that is not what we are dealing with here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no indication that by 12 o'clock next Tuesday the Government will rush through the implementation of family courts in Scotland, especially as there would be additional expense because of the differing kinds of social work that would be attached. The argument in favour of family courts is one not only of expense but of their social value, so there is no question of that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is, which is easier to develop? Let us imagine the Court of Session trying to deal with such problems in the role of a family court, with wigs and gowns. It would be nonsense and the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) knows it. The truth is that divorce actions in Scotland, despite recent moves and reforms, remain a painful, and for many people, expensive and unpleasant business. This is an attempt to make them easier, therefore more humane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has cast doubt on the report of the Royal Commission, but what it argues is sensible and practical. If the hon. Gentleman tables a new clause on family courts the Opposition will support him, but if he does not, he should at least pay attention to the Royal Commission which says in its report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we must say we cannot see any justification for requiring parties and their witnesses to go to the expense of having to travel to Edinburgh to obtain a divorce. It is not simply that costs are needlessly high because of having to attend before the Court of Session. There are other factors."</p></blockquote>
Those other factors are listed. One that it does not mention is one which some of us with experience of advising and assisting people know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember having to help a family of travelling people for whom the process of going to Edinburgh was in itself terrifying and for whom the process of having to spend two or three days in Edinburgh living in hotels was both difficult and expensive. Often those are the type of people who are faced with such problems and who require most assistance. So, apart from the expense
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
of the action, the expense of travelling there can be a factor of considerable importance to people with low incomes. They do not all travel by train. They may come from all parts of Scotland and this can be difficult for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific costs arise from the present position. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) described them in some detail. He mentioned the triple involvement of solicitors, the documents and so on. I quote again from the report of the Royal Commission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An examination of accounts suggests that a very large part of the heavy cost of executing procedures is incurred in the initial enquiries and preparation of precognitions and affidavits which are normally undertaken by the local solicitor. The transfer of jurisdiction … would not of itself and without simplifying procedure reduce the cost."</p></blockquote>
The report adds that the employment of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Edinburgh solicitors and advocates must mean a significant addition to the expense."</p></blockquote>
The report points out that the sheriff courts are already involved in other aspects of consistorial business and suggests that it would be useful to have them dealing with all aspects. The Opposition agree with that. I cannot understand why the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) objects to that in relation to corroboration. After all, he voted for the removal of corroboration in relation to the imposition of fines on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Has he forgotten? Was he so ignorant of the proceedings that were taking place on that Bill that he did not vote for the clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman, in case he has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
forgotten, was a member of the Committee which allowed an extension of the rejection of corroboration. I accept that I initiated that in relation to compensation cases. But this Government, whom he supports, also brough it in in relation to the road traffic legislation, and he supported it. He raises the question of corroboration which, in any case, is already dispensed with in many civil actions, in order to add to his present argument, not for introducing family courts, but for retaining the present system and the bonanza for Edinburgh-based advocates and others. His arguments would be better if they were consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for the attack. It is nonsense, and he knows it. I was saying that if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) wishes to introduce divorce into the sheriff court and claims that it is cheaper, he should decide whether he requires evidence to be corroborated in the sheriff court. I was passing no view on whether that evidence should be corroborated, but if one continues to have corroboration, it is undoubtedly expensive. One must have not only a form from the pursuer, but also a form or an affidavit from someone else, and ensure that the two tie in. If that is introduced into the sheriff court, one must have regard to the expense. That has nothing to do with the minor changes made to the law on corroboration in Committee on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised because I thought that the hon. Gentleman was attacking my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden for introducing a system which would lead to an end of corroboration in such matters. If he was not doing so, I cannot understand his reason for raising the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that in cases where there is no dispute, sworn evidence of this kind should be unnecessary."</p></blockquote>
that is, the affidavit—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and we recommend that the court should be able to proceed upon a written form completed by the pursuer with a signed declaration that what is stated is the truth."</p></blockquote>
Of course, we are also dealing with divorces which are in many cases undefended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
The truth is that divorce is an expensive, protracted and often unpleasant business. There is delay, inconvenience and often not only hardship but a good deal of fear, as people experience more and more complications. I have encountered that when people have had to travel to Edinburgh. It is simplest to decide to move towards family courts, one aspect of which would be to remove the wig of the hon. Member for South Angus. But those who wish to retain the full panoply and paraphernalia of the courts, with all their inhibitions and terrors, can hardly also say "Let us, next Tuesday, have the family court." If we wish to move in that direction, a simple, cheap and necessary step is to have the proceedings as close to people's homes as possible, and as low-key and inexpensive as possible. That demands at least the introduction of divorce cases, like other consistorial actions, into the sheriff courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now some eight weeks since the Royal Commission made its various recommendations including those affecting the law of divorce. The contributions during the course of the debate, particularly that from my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), illustrate the number of issues that are already seen to separate not simply members of the Committee but various outside bodies in regard to the details of the law of divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this early stage in my remarks I wish to say that the Government feel the new clause is premature and that it is far too early to come to a firm decision on the principle enunciated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). It will be necessary to consider in some detail the proposals of the Royal Commission to see whether they ought to be implemented and, if so, in what particular form. It is of interest that during the course of the debate my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Garscadden between them have already identified, so far as I can determine, three areas where the Royal Commission's proposals are at variance with views of the Law Society of Scotland. Clearly, consultation will be required to determine the appropriate position to take. For example, the Royal Commission proposed that the sheriff court should have exclusive jurisdiction for actions of divorce in the first instance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0975">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
and the Law Society is opposed to that particular suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the proposals of the Royal Commission, about automatic reference to the children's panels. That is a radical change with wide implications, and it is not a proposal on which the Law Society has come out in support. Equally, the hon. Member for Garscadden has informed the Committee that the Law Society is opposed to the Royal Commission's proposals on the rule of corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are just three areas where there are clearly wide differences of view, even among those who support the principle of the reference to the sheriff court to deal with some actions of divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I anticipated that that argument would be used and I do not say that it has no validity, but it might be helpful if the Minister will indicate whether, on the matter of principle, the Government are sympathetic to the idea of an extension of jurisdiction. Second—and I believe this is an important point— what sort of time scale for the procedure for consultation does he envisage? Does he accept that this would be a suitable matter for Government legislation rather than for it to be left to private Members' legislation as has always been the case for the social and moral content of divorce grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the hon. Gentleman that the Government are open minded at this stage on the question of jurisdiction for a divorce. Of course, we acknowledge the force of the arguments put from a number of quarters, not least from the Royal Commission, in support of a transfer of jurisdiction to the sheriff court. We are equally aware that some powerful arguments have been put against such a change, as we saw when the former Member for Argyll, Mr. MacCormick, put forward his proposals in a similar way. Therefore, the Government are open minded. We have had a specific set of recommendations from the Royal Commission and wish to consider both the principle of a transfer of jurisdiction to the sheriff court and the way in which that might be done if the principle were thought acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the views of the Royal Commission, and that in a number of important
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
respects the Law Society takes different views. I understand that the Society of Writers to the Signet is now considering the matter as it clearly has a legitimate interest in that area. I presume that the Faculty of Advocates will also have a view it will wish to make known and, clearly, the judiciary is involved. Quite apart from the issues of principle there are administrative problems with which we shall have to deal, if such a change is thought appropriate. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus pointed out, there are about 10,000 divorce cases, and a substantial number of these could be taken in the sheriff courts if such a change were made and, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden acknowledged, a very high proportion—about 50 per cent. of the total —would be taken within the Glasgow sheriffdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding the remarks of the hon. Gentleman, plainly a deep study has to be made of the implications for the Glasgow sheriff court if it were to be asked to absorb such a substantial increase in work and it would be only right and legitimate to consult those involved before coming to such a decision. The Government are conscious that the cost factor, emphasised in the speech of the hon. Member for Garscadden, is not only an important emotional point but a perfectly legitimate point about which we are equally concerned because it creates problems for sections of the community. In that respect, the proposals of Lord Cowie are not only interesting in themselves but form an initial change in the rules as regards the processing of divorce applications which will deal with a wide proportion of the sort of cases the hon. Member for Garscadden had in mind. I am able to say to the Committee today that Lord Emslie, the Lord President of the Court of Session, intends to implement in the near future the proposals of the Cowie committee. I am sure that in the very wide area of undefended cases not involving children, the new simplified procedures which the Cowie committee has recommended will have substantial cost implications for those seeking divorce actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have mixed feelings about what the Minister has said. Perhaps he will say a word or two in amplification. I presume that it will be done by Act of Sederunt and that therefore there will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
no debate or discussion in Parliament on the matter. Does the Minister consider that that is satisfactory? When will the Act of Sederunt come into force? What are the Minister's proposals for the dissemination of information and so on? This is an important change. They are complicated forms. I would think that there would have to be a public information exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee is aware, the Cowie committee's terms of reference did not involve any changes in the law. The committee's task was to proceed on the basis of the existing law and simplify the procedure in the interests of the public and of those seeking a divorce through the Court of Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in assuming that as the committee's proposals did not involve any change in legislation, it follows automatically that no legislation is required to implement those proposals. I am sure that the Lord President would welcome any helpful suggestions that anyone might wish to make about the details of the proposals, but these are essentially changes for the Lord President to make through an Act of Sederunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden emphasised that his main consideration was to simplify and to cheapen for the applicant the processing of straightforward, undefended divorce actions. Whatever view the members of the Committee or anyone else might wish to form on the whole question of jurisdiction, the consumer is concerned with cost and there is no doubt that the Cowie proposals, in the area to which they are relevant, would have substantial implications to the benefit of a pursuer in such actions and would lead to significant reductions in cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the effects of the affidavit procedure was to eliminate the problem to which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) referred—the need to bring people to Edinburgh? It appears, however, that the scheme, as it is operating at present, has been more expensive than paying people their train fare from Glasgow to Edinburgh. That may need correction. By making a change for the right reasons, additional costs have been incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
rightly identified the fact that sometimes the right and positive theory will have unfortunate practical consequences. My hon. Friend can be assured that the Cowie proposals which deal with postal applications in the areas with which they are concerned, would not have such a consequence and would substantially meet the objective of the hon. Member for Garscadden of substantially reducing the cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to intervene six semi-colons ago on the throw-away remark that this would be done by Act of Sederunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, that is extremely important. The hon. Gentleman referred to the element of expense. It would be nice if we could examine that consideration. There are many implications in terms of law and—more important—there are many implications for our constituents. We are dealing with human problems here. For far too long—for five centuries, I understand—there have been Acts of Adjournal and Acts of Sederunt. It is time that democracy was allowed to bear on some of the arcane mysteries of the College of Justice in Edinburgh. Is this not something that should be debated by laymen in the House of Commons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that the House of Commons is a legislature and as such is required to be involved when legislation is proposed. If any changes in legislation are proposed, they can be effected only through the House, and that is right and proper. But the whole point of the Cowie proposals was that the committee was investigating matters that did not require legislation in order to be implemented. It has been for many centuries the custom of the Court of Session to control its own detailed procedure by Act of Sederunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to change that whole principle and procedure, he must extend his views beyond the simple question of the matter we are discussing and must promote in the normal way his desire to reform the whole concept of Acts of Sederunt and Acts of Adjournal. Unless and until the hon. Gentleman is successful in that endeavour we have to live with the existing legal procedures and not those that the hon. Gentleman might prefer to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no legislative changes inherent in the Cowie proposals. Therefore, there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
no way in which the sanction of this House should be required for them to be implemented. There is a recognised procedure which has existed for many years and the Government could not prevent an Act of Sederunt—even if they wished to—if the Lord President wished to pursue it. The Government have no desire to do so in any event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I described, from a sedentary position, as the Fraser manoeuvre. The Minister says that if we want to achieve something small we must go the whole hog and turn the whole of Scottish law upside down. Would it not be a simple matter for the Scottish Grand Committee to discuss the proposals so that its view, and the view o this House, should be made known to the senators before they discuss it? That would be an interesting step forward, quite apart from legislation giving us more formal responsibility in the matter, which I should prefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are not matters entirely for me. If the Opposition wish to have certain subjects discussed in the Grand Committee there are recognised ways of achieving that. We achieved it with the concern of some Opposition Members, about the Crown Office circular. The Opposition have it within their power to ensure that matters are debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary agree that the Lord President's previous attempt to simplify divorce procedures, as the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said, was extremely unfortunate and was counter-productive? Will the Under-Secretary also accept that a substantial change has been proposed. It is not minor procedural tinkering. It is a total departure from procedure as we know it. The final paragraph of the working party report says that the aim is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtain divorce without legal representation".</p></blockquote>
The Minister was waxing eloquent about the need to consult the Society of Writers to the Signet, the solicitors to the Supreme Court and Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all, as reasons for not hurrying forward with the new clause. I have some sympathy with that, but should we not also have the same con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
sultations with wider public interests before we include something as fundamentally important as this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already indicated that, as far as I am aware, the Lord President would be only too happy to hear the views of anyone who wishes to put ideas to him. The Cowie committee's report has been published for some time. Any interested bodies who wish to make submissions based on it are free to do so, which is perfectly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Session is not a Department of the Government. The Secretary of State cannot instruct the Court of Session. We have an independent judiciary and I presume that it is the hon. Gentleman's desire as much as it is ours that it should continue to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) likes it or not, part of our existing constitutional arrangements allows the Lord President, if he wishes, to enact Acts of Sederunt in connection with the procedure carried out by the Court of Session. Even if the Government or the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West objected, there is no constitutional way in which we could prevent that from happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the Government do not wish to prevent it from happening. We think that the change is perfectly sensible and one that directly responds to the objections that the hon. Gentlemen have spent the earlier part of this morning seeking to assert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister guarantee that even if the Government are allowing the Lord President, or having to watch the Lord President—because they cannot interfere—carry through this reform, this will not pre-empt the wider issue of divorce jurisdiction being extended, or of other divorce law reforms being adopted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great tendency for people to say—the Under-Secretary said it— that because there has been reform within the Court of Session there is no need to worry about those difficult issues that attack interests in other areas. Can we have a categorical assurance that the impetus to look at wider reforms will continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can happily assure the hon. Gentleman that, as I have in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
dicated, the Government are open minded on the proposals of the Royal Commissiion. We intend to consult on the basis of those proposals. Any implementation, in the interim, of the Cowie recommendations will in no way predetermine or prejudge the outcome of those consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recognise— in private if not in public—that the Royal Commission's proposals will obviously require consultation and discussions with outside bodies. He is really proposing a choice of two things. He knews perfectly well that we cannot implement divorce in the sheriff court. He knows that that will not happen. He knows that there is to be consultation. He can therefore say that we are doing nothing until the end of that process of consultation. If that is what he wishes, let him say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government are saying: Let us go ahead with the consultation but in the meantime let us give support to the Lord President's objective to implement the Cowie proposals which will reduce the cost and will simplify the procedure. If the hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friend are opposed to that, they are putting up an even more remarkable case in favour of the status quo than anyone in the Faculty of Advocates could ever have dreamed of. I did not think that that was the hon. Gentleman's objective, but if it is, I am happy to give way in order that they can indicate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No that is not what I want to say. It struck me that in line with recent statements, any day now we shall hear a proposal to denationalise the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the law should have been in public ownership in the first place is not for me to say. I do not think there are any specific proposals to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only speak for myself, but I do not want there to be a long delay. All the Opposition are concerned about is that this change that has been brought in by Act of Sederunt seems to be more than an internal change of procedure. It raises matters of principle about the future shape of divorce law reform which should be the subject of wider debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
The Committee is small and rather narrowly-based in composition. I read its report with care, but I do not believe that it constitutes the kind of consultation that ought to precede a change of this significance. I repeat my anxiety— not about the Minister personally but in terms of the inertia of the system— that there is a great temptation for people to say "We have done something. It may be modest and it may be small but we have done something. So let us use it as a kind of bulwark— entrenchment—against those who want to make further progress." I should be most upset if that were to be the result of this so-called modest initiative from the Lord President.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Cowie proposals are not some minor procedural matter that are of interest only to the members of the Committee. But I emphasise that the proposals have been published, which is not what normally happens with Acts of Sederunt. It indicates that the Committee recognises that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman needs reassurance, I repeat that the Government do not intend to use the implementation of the Cowie proposals as an argument that the whole matter is now closed and that no further change is required. We are prepared to look on their merits at the proposals that have been put forward by the Royal Commission and the Law Society, and as a result of that consultation we shall be in a position to consider what changes may be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made the great mistake of reading the outrageous unemployment figures before I rose to pass comments on what the Minister has just said. Let me put on record that neither the Minister nor any other Conservative Member speaks with any authority for any person in the United Kingdom after the publication of the fact that l.9 million people are now unemployed, 236,000 of whom are unemployed in Scotland. Perhaps we should add a few judges to that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the matter under discussion. Let me put on record that we register the strongest possible protest at the decision that has been taken by the Lord President to implement the re-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
commendations of the working party without adequate and proper discussion on the very important matters involved. We do not accept that by Act of Sederunt is the way to handle this proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither is it good enough for the Minister to say that if the Opposition wish to discuss this subject, facilities are available, as though the Government have no responsibility to facilitate a discussion on this important matter. It is not good enough to say that if there is to be discussion, it will have to be initiated at the behest of the Opposition. The Government have some responsibility in this matter, and it would be much more gracious if the Minister had accepted his responsibility and given us some indication that arrangements were being made for such a debate to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that this raises an important matter almost of morality. This is the first time in Scotland that we have had what is often referred to in shorthand as the quickie divorce by post. I may be in favour of moving down that road, but I know that a lot of my constituents who take a serious view of the sanctity of the marriage contract will find this move offensive. They will find it doubly offensive if it is being done in this hole and corner, backdoor way in a closed Committee under the pretence that it is merely a minor procedural amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He may find not only that some of his constituents are worried about divorce by post, but that some of his colleagues are worried about the whole subject. I well remember that during the course of a Private Member's Bill, which was introduced by Iain MacCormick, the then hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire —George Reid—tabled an amendment to provide for exactly what is suggested by the working party—divorce by post. I spoke against that amendment. I am not ashamed to say that I described the proposition at that time in the words of a then popular song being sung by Sydney Devine.
	<br><blockquote><p>"What was it that the Church, the court room and man could buy?"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
I thought that that song adequately described the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have serious reservations on this matter, and that is why I am so anxious to have this matter discussed publicly and not introduced by a backdoor method at the behest of any working party, or the Lord President, or whoever is responsible for introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that there has not been a greater outcry on the Committee about what the Minister said. Frankly, on behalf of the Opposition, I want to register the strongest complaint about the way in which this subject is being handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an English Member representing a Plymouth constituency, Miss Fookes, with divorce available in the county courts throughout England and Wales, you must find it difficult to comprehend the situation in Scotland where anyone from the Orkneys and Shetlands right down to the Borders who wants a divorce has to take the case to one place and one court only—namely, Edinburgh. People from the length and breadth of the land within the boundaries of Scotland can obtain a divorce only in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an aside, what my hon. Friend said about whether a Government will legislate on this important matter is central to our discussion. There is no point in the Minister saying that he is prepared to have discussions, that he wants to know all the opinions on the Royal Commission's recommendations on divorce, if, at the end of the day, these opinions and discussions will merely be pigeonholed on the pretence that Governments do not legislate on such moral issues and that it is left to Back-Bench Members to take up the cudgels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be appropriate and help discussion if, before we came to a decision on the matter, the Minister were to indicate whether, in the lifetime of this Government—I do not know how long this Government will last against the background of today's unemployment figures, but I assume that they will last for another year—there is a possibility of their coming forward with proposals based on their discussions against a background of what is said by the Royal Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
When reading his brief on the new clause, the Minister opened with exactly the same words with which the Civil Service briefed me when I replied to a similar debate four or five years ago— "inopportune at the moment", "it is not the time", "it is a wee bit premature"—nothing changes. We do nothing, and in the meantime the people of Scotland continue to suffer and to travel the length and breadth of their land. What the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and the Minister said is a recipe for continuing that situation and doing nothing at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that ordinary folk in Scotland reading this debate tomorrow will have any great hope in the forward looking attitudes that parliamentarians are supposed to have in developing new approaches to the problems that affect people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of taking divorce to the sheriff court in order to make it easier. If the argument was that by taking divorce to the sheriff courts we would make divorce 	<i>per se</i> easier, I would be against that. I am not in favour of making divorce easier, but there is a difference between making it easier in the sense that we make it convenient— avoiding what happens at present, with the long distances that people have to travel, and the network of solicitors and advocates through which they must go —by taking it to the sheriff courts, and making it easier morally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one on the Committee would favour making divorce easier morally, and I would not want the impression to be given by our debate that we do. That is not what our debate is about. It is about whether we ought to end the ridiculous situation where only the Court of Session in Edinburgh handles divorce cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problems in a divorce action which includes arrangements for children of a marriage. When Iain MacCormick put his Bill before Parliament there was much discussion of the way in which the English courts give a county court judge the right to delay implementation of a divorce action for up to six months in order that the needs of children can be taken into account or considered further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also the position in Scotland. The Court of Session might agree to a divorce, but it has the power to say,
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
"We will agree to a divorce in six months' time provided that by then we can settle the problems relating to the children." I will not pooh-pooh the problem of the children. I regard it most important. But the suggestion of the hon. Member for South Angus that the way to deal with it is to establish family courts is a recipe for doing nothing. We all know that there will not be family courts. I doubt whether any member of the Committee who lives his normal allotted span will see family courts come into existence. I do not believe that it will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some young fellows around here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am probably the youngest member of the Committee, so I speak with greater authority than my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will not be family courts and we ought to turn our mind to how we deal with the position against that background. We are misleading people by suggesting that this is the way to resolve this problem and deal with all the difficulties involved when in our hearts we know that no such courts will be set up. If the Committee is to do anything about this, it must impose its will on the Government and make them think again about how we can remove divorce actions from the Court of Session to the sheriff courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problems of Glasgow sheriff court, and I am not pushing them aside. But the fact that they exist has never been a reason for not tackling them. There might be problems in business management in the Glasgow sheriff court, and while it is one of the most important—if not the most important —sheriff courts in Scotland, it is the only area of Scotland where there is but one sheriff court within the sheriffdom. Every other sheriffdom has a number of them. My constituents in Stirling would not object to travelling the 18 miles to Falkirk to have their divorce action heard in Falkirk sheriff court, nor would the people of Falkirk object to going to Stirling to have their divorce action heard there. They do, however, object to having to go to Edinburgh to have it heard there through a loop of solicitors and advocates, thus adding to the costs.

	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
I was surprised when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) explained the procedures that still exist. When Iain MacCormick, the former SNP Member for Argyll, put his Bill through one of the main arguments in favour of reforming the divorce laws was that much of the investigatory nature would end, but it appears that it still goes on. The grounds for divorce were changed in the hope that much of what was happening at that time would end, but that was a false hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to say that the first job of a consultant was to look for his next job. I have come to the same conclusion with regard to solicitors. Their first job is to look for the next. I am not castigating my hon. Friend, I am getting at his profession. It is depressing to hear that these investigation still happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the constant references by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) to the problem of travelling. I am not clear whether he appreciates that in the uncomplicated case, because of the affidavit procedure, travelling to a court, be it in Edinburgh or elsewhere, is now a thing of the past. Travelling is necessary in cases where a problem of custody or financial provisions has still to be argued out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the hon. Member accepts that, and that he has been merely speaking in a rather telescoped fashion. But does he not appreciate that if his argument were to be carried through and we were to transfer jurisdiction to the sheriff court, where parties were living apart—a man could be earning his living in Caithness while the woman and the children were in Dumfries—one party, at least, would have to embark on a sizeable amount of travelling. Therefore, the issue is not as black and white as the hon. Gentleman has presented it. Manifold problems will still have to be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to that is that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) is clutching at straws if he cites a case where the parties are living apart, perhaps one in Elgin and one in Dumfries, and where one of
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
those parties would have to travel to the sheriff court. I do not know how many such cases there might be but I strongly suspect that the percentage would be very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon. Member said at the beginning of his intervention: where there is no dispute, no travel is involved. His hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said that there were about 5,000 cases involving children, and probably more where other arrangements for property and money have to be made by the Court of Session. Therefore, in the majority of cases extensive travel is involved because divorce actions can be heard only in the Edinburgh Court of Session. That has prevailed in Scotland for a long time under successive Governments and under successive legislators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make myself clear. There are more than 5,000 divorces in which children are involved. But in all those cases one party does not have to travel to court. Where children are involved, at present there is an elaborate affidavit procedure, which is costly—I do not seek to escape that. But that procedure avoids the party having to go to court. If one is to put evidence before the court relating to those children, one has either to bring the party to give that evidence, have an affidavit, or have an independent person coming forward with a report to the court. The Royal Commission suggested that that person should be the reporter from the children's panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal briefly with the Royal Commission's suggestion that the reporter from the children's panel should deal with the report in relation to the children. Against the background of family courts, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and the background of public expenditure, which must exercise the Government's mind almost day and night, I suspect that the reporter to the children's panel system would be less costly than the family court system. But that is a matter for debate, which we shall go into at a later date. In my constituency case load—I suspect that this is true for every Member of Parliament—I receive numerous complaints from people involved in divorce actions having to travel to Edinburgh. I am not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
arguing that it is a great inconvenience for my constituents, because it is not, although it might be in some cases. But as one gets further from Edinburgh the inconvenience becomes that much greater. I find it difficult to explain to people why only one court in Scotland deals with divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Although I cannot vote on this issue because of a pairing arrangement I strongly advise my hon. Friends to press this matter to a vote in order to put their feelings on the record.

	<p>my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, who held the position much earlier in parliamentary history and by other Ministers. They all said the same thing and had the same answer to this proposition: "The proposition is premature." My argument is that now is the time. Unless we as a Committee impose our will on the Government, nothing will happen and we all know that nothing will happen. We shall go through this Parliament and probably the next, and we shall come to the end of the century in the same position as we are in on 22 July 1980. Therefore, I advise my hon. Friends to press this matter to a vote.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 6.</p>
	<p>anyone who enrols as a solicitor, which, if I remember rightly, involves a petition to the Court of Session—should at the same time automatically be applying for admission as notary public.</p>
	<p>At the moment one can be a solicitor throughout one's career without ever bothering to become a notary public. I am not a notary public, which, while I was practising the law, did not cause any great inconvenience. If I were now in everyday practice, I should certainly want to be a notary public, because, as a result of the efforts of the Lord President at simplification to which we referred in the previous debate, there is now an affidavit procedure in divorce which means that any solicitor with consistorial practice has to be a notary public to notarise his clients' affidavits. If he is not, he has constant trouble in looking for a brother solicitor who is prepared, perhaps for a small fee or some other form of consideration, to oblige him by acting as a notary public.</p>
	<p>We now have an intimation that there will be some limited and fundamental changes in procedure in the Court of Session. But even if we accept that</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
	<p>about 25 per cent, of present undefended divorces will fall into the category of quickie cases, the other 75 per cent, of the ever-increasing divorce total will require affidavit procedures. Even in the "quickie" there will have to be notarised documents. Therefore, it becomes absolutely essential that there is a way of becoming a notary public cheaply and simply. In fact, qualification as a notary is becoming a built-in necessity for anyone who wants a mixed practice in Scotland today.</p>
	<p>The problem is that, under present rules, to become a notary public in Scotland one has to go through an initiation ceremony which no doubt would be worthy of the masonic lodges. I do not think that one has to roll up one's trouser leg above the knee, stand on one leg and repeat oaths, but one certainly has to lie flat—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does my hon. Friend know that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, because I have not gone through the initiation ceremony and all sorts of strange, cabalistic and expensive rituals may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one has to raise a petition, travel to Edinburgh, invent one's own Latin oath and pay a considerable fee to the clerk in charge of the admission to notaries public. All that is clumsy and unnecessary. In the days when to be a notary public was perhaps a luxury— almost a status symbol for some people —no doubt there was justification for keeping the old ways. But now that it is almost an essential part of the tools of the trade, it is appropriate that it should be an automatic result of the petition for enrolment as a solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was hoping to be able to say that I would withdraw the new clause. If we had extended divorce jurisdiction to the sheriff court or had had a firm undertaking from the Minister that there would be some changes that would make us less dependent upon affidavit procedure, the steam would have gone from the new clause. But clearly we shall live with the present expensive and time consuming affidavit procedure for a long time. In those circumstances the kind of proposal embodied in new clause 4 has become essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garacadden (Mr. Dewar) and I freely concede that there are some attractive reasons for supporting his proposal. However, the Government are not yet convinced that the Committee should accept this recommendation. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that the Government have been only too happy to accept a number of his proposals, but there seems to be a sharp clash of view here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may, for instance, be aware of the view of the Clerk to the Admissions of Notaries Public—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not anticipated that rather emotional reaction of the hon. Member for Garscadden. He may be privy to some information of which I am not entirely aware, but I think that the gentleman in question is entitled to express a view on the hon. Gentleman's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clerk's evidence to the Royal Commission was that, despite the many similarities between the Scottish notary public and the solicitor, they were fundamentally different in concept. His view was that a notary public was a public official, while the solicitor worked within a highly confidential solicitor-client relationship. Accordingly he thought it important that the two roles should not be confused and that, therefore, any solicitor who wished to become a notary public should make his specific application to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the Government have come to the conclusion that that is a wrong judgment to make, but there is clearly a difference of view here. We will look further into the matter, but at this stage we are not convinced that the amendment is one to commend itself to the Committee. I hope that, with the assurance that the Government will examine the matter further, the hon. Gentleman will agree not to press his new clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose we have had some concession that it will be looked at, and we should be thankful for small mercies. If I were to table a new clause tomorrow, abolishing Under-Secretaries, it would be very likely that the Under-

	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Secretary of State for Scotland would have an unfavourable view on the matter. I would not necessarily give a great deal of weight to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With all respect to the Clerk to the Admission of Notaries Public, I think he has a vested interest which no doubt he honourably advances. But I do not think it one that should overwhelm the Committee with its authority. Frankly, the distinction he draws is gobbledegook, and it would only have validity if there were a situation in which solicitors, for example, on occasion applied, and were refused, or that there was some sort of discretionary element in admission. But it is an empty ritual formula involving seals, Latin oaths, fees, journeys to Edinburgh, all sorts of such nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have a look at this matter before the Report stage and consider whether something should be done. It seems self-evidently sensible, and as far as I know is supported widely in the profession. But on his assurance that he is seriously considering the matter and is not objecting to it out of hand, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RECORDING OF VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"At the conclusion of a criminal trial under solemn procedure if a verdict of acquittal is brought in the jury shall not be asked by the court if that verdict is unanimous or by majority and such information shall not be given or recorded in the minute of proceedings.".—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 20, in Title, line 3, after "Scotland", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>";and the form in which verdicts in criminal jury trials are recorded".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of a criminal trial the jury is asked for its verdict and, whether the verdict is "guilty" or "not guilty." The jury is then asked whether the decision is unanimous. If unanimous, it is normally recorded that it is either unanimous or, if appropriate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
by majority. Strangely, if the verdict is by majority the figures are not announced, although I have never been in a jury trial at which, within five minutes of its conclusion, I was not aware of what the figures were, as almost invariably the court attendant has that interesting piece of gossip ready and waiting for the counsel, solicitors, or anyone else who may be interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the new clause is that when a verdict of acquittal is brought in, the presumption of innocence obviously runs. I do not think that the court procedures— a very simple point—should do anything to undermine that presumption of innocence. It is undermined to the extent that if someone comes in and says "Our verdict is not guilty", ant it was a majority decision, that information is of no practical value in regard to the further administration of justice. The majority verdict is an acquittal in the same way as the unanimous verdict is of acquittal, but it clearly leaves —perhaps is intended to leave—in the minds of those in the court a lingering doubt. People have often said to me, as my client has walked from the court after a majority verdict of acquittal "You were lucky". That may or may not be so, but he has got a verdict of acquittal, and it should be left to rest there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the effect of the new clause is merely that when the verdict is either not proven or not guilty there should be no further inquiry as to whether it is the verdict of all, or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was a matter that the Thomson committee looked into and, indeed, had submissions putting both points of view. The committee's conclusion was that on balance it could not support any change of the kind proposed by the hon. Gentleman. That was the recommendation in paragraph 51.57 of its report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically their argument was that if there were a majority verdict there would be circumstances in which the dissenting members of the jury wished it to be known that the verdict was not unanimous. One can understand their reasons. Again, this is an area where there are arguments on both sides. I am prepared to say to the hon. Gentleman that I will consult the various interested bodies on this question to see whether they share the views of the Thomson Committee. The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that if such a change were to be made it would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
require legislation. On that basis I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel free to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what my hon. Friend feels about withdrawing the new clause. I am certainly not at all happy about doing so. The new clause arises from some of the discussions we had on what was in some ways a more appropriate Bill the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. It is certainly appropriate also to bring it in here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that we had certain discussions about the nature of the majority system in Scottish jury verdicts. At that point I had argued for a numerical change. We regarded the simple eight-seven majority as insufficient for guilt because dubiety existed. Another aspect is that when a person is found innocent, those defending the eight-seven verdicts felt that to be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were sufficient to say that a majority verdict could find a person guilty, and that was an end to the matter, it did not lessen his sentence. Even if it were brought in by eight-seven he still served his five years. The other side of the coin is that when a man is declared innocent, he should be declared "innocent" and no dubiety should be left. I have enough anxieties over the "not proven" verdict for this reason. No man leaves the court with a "not proven" verdict, feeling that he can present himself to society completely in the clear. But that verdict is allowed. Where the verdict is not brought in no matter what the figures for the majority verdict or whether it was a majority verdict—the point that we are dealing with here—the man has not been found guilty. Ergo, by all the rules and custom of law, he should be declared innocent. He should not carry out of that court the obloquy of having merely been found innocent by a majority, which suggests that many people on the jury—perhaps seven of them—felt that he was guilty. The option is open to the jury in Scotland to offer a verdict of "not proven". If that has not been used, a stop occurs at that point. If a man is found innocent, he is found innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other arguments. It would take too much time to deploy them. One is that of rehabilitation. There is no merit in saying that we wish to aim for the rehabilitation of people, and to secure that—in
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
this case—innocent people go back into society and are properly treated, if such an obloquy hangs over them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to pursue the question beyond what the Minister has said about whether legislation is required, but, short of a firm promise from him that such a direction will be given, I hope that my hon. Friend will consider adhering to his view and that we pass the new clause by the decision of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the major arguments used by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) was, I regret to say, wrong. He said that this process would not assist in the rehabilitation of offenders. Either the person has been found "not guilty" in which case the issue of rehabilitation does not arise, or if he has been found "guilty", the fact that he was guilty by a majority as opposed to unanimously is unlikely to be of any significance in his ultimate rehabilitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had heard myself saying precisely that, and that I then went on to amplify what I meant. The position is that if a person has been through such a process there is also the question of rehabilitation, not in the sense of having been an offender but of being brought back as a full member of society. If he comes back into society with this type of cloud over him, it is to that extent more difficult to rehabilitate him—in the sense of absorption—back into his full social, civil climate. That is all that I meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. I said earlier that the Thomson committee had recommended against any such change. Notwithstanding that I am prepared to have the matter discussed with the various interested bodies to see whether they come to the same or a different conclusion. If the bulk of opinion put to the Government suggests that a change of the kind proposed would be advisable, it will be possible to do that without legislation. However, in advance of knowing the views of other outside bodies, we have only the advantage of knowing the views of the Thomson committee which does not support the new clause. At this stage I cannot give the assurance sought, but I can give an assurance as regards future discussions on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me a good deal of pleasure to move the new clause, especially as I do so in full confidence that it will be accepted—an unusual position in some of our discussions of recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the clause arose from a case with which I had to deal as a Member of Parliament—not as a lawyer— because the legal proceedings that had been taken ultimately failed. It was a case involving compensation for pneumoconiosis. Because of the statute of limitations, because of the time bar, the case was lost and no compensation was obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was an interesting case. I shall not go into the details, but it hinged on whether the fact that one could take legal action was known in time or whether the only material fact that mattered was the plaintiff's knowledge that he had the disease. I have read the appeal and Lord Hailsham made clear his sympathy for the appellant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises particularly in Scotland because in England the courts have discretion to waive the time bar. In this case, the man had developed pneumoconiosis, had consulted his local trade union branch secretary who told him that he could not apply for compensation. The man did nothing about it, and then 10 years later he read in the press that somebody had received compensation. The action was raised. It was time-barred, because under Scottish law the material fact that he adduced, that he had only just discovered that he could apply for compensation, was not seen as a material fact within the meaning of Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to thank the Government for their immediate response when I raised this matter, especially the Solicitor-General. I have been giving him a lot of work—for good reason—during the past few months. On this occasion he has emerged well and he has acted as quickly as he could by suggesting that a new clause could be brought forward in this Bill. I have to thank also the Government for preparing the clause. The technicalities were such that I could not have done it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
The new clause gives the Scottish courts a discretion to override the time limits in which an action for damages in respect of personal injury is required to be brought by the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973. Since 1975, the English courts have had the right to bring in this discretion, and therefore we are merely asking for a similar power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) empowers the courts, on application being made to them by any person who would have been entitled, were it not for the problem of the 1973 Act, to bring an action of damages for personal injuries, to override these time limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) is a necessary transitional provision. It provides that the court's power to override the time limits applies, first, to rights of action which accrue after commencement of the new clause, which it would do in any event and, second, to rights of action which have accrued before such commencement, provided final judgment has not been pronounced in respect of them. In other words, it would resolve any doubts whether and to what extent it applies to rights of action which have accrued before its commencement and became time barred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the problem of subsection (3). I welcome the Government's support for the clause. I am concerned, however, that subsection (3) would not allow parties who have already brought an unsuccessful action which has been dismissed—as happened in my own constituent's case because it was time barred—to ask the court to exercise its due discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at that because I thought that once the new law had been brought in an action could be raised irrespective of whether an action had been raised under the previous legislation. The material facts still exist. Surely it should be open for someone previously time barred to proceed with a new action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that definition is right, I have won the war but lost the battle. If the Minister's comment is not satisfactory, I may wish to pursue the matter further. That sounds ungracious, but it is not meant to be. There will be opportunities on Report or in another place to pursue it further if the clause is accepted as it stands. With that caveat I thank the Minister and hope that he can give us further assurances on subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
attacks that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) made on my reactionary political views, I take this opportunity to congratulate him on introducing the new clause. I, too, welcome its introduction. There was a loophole in the law of Scotland. It was unfortunate that on a number of occasions people lost what might otherwise properly have been a claim for compensation from their employers. An appeal had to go all the way to the House of Lords where it was indicated that there was a problem. It seems that this is an opportune moment to rectify that error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for the way in which he expressed himself. The new clause will be of considerable benefit to the law of Scotland and will deal with the problem that has created concern in the areas mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). The Government welcome the new clause and hope it will have the benefits to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's specific question was on subsection (3) and retrospection. I freely concede that it is difficult to decide whether the benefit of bringing application for an action after it has been time-barred should apply to those who have raised the issue and had a plea of time bar by the defence accepted by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On such occasions it is always difficult to decide with finality. However, it would be very serious if a defender, who having had an action raised against him and the court having time barred it, and who quite properly assumed that the matter was completely dead and could not be reopened, were suddenly to find himself exposed to a possible action. He may have destroyed papers and other evidence relevant to the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I freely concede that this is a difficult area. Clearly, where a time bar application has not been made it is possible that those consequences would flow. It is particularly so when a pursuer has raised an action that has been specifically dismissed by the court and the defender has no reason to believe that the matter can be reopened. If the defender found some years later that there was a possibility of it being reopened, that would create an even greater sense of injustice. That would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
outweigh the obvious benefits to the pursuer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that this was not an easy decision. We felt that on balance it was the place where the line legitimately had to be drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the tone of his remarks. I cannot accept his comments on the specifics. Of course, it would create a sense of injustice in a defender but, virtually by definition, the defender is at least better off and able more strenuously to maintain his sense of injustice than the poor pursuer, who in the case to which I referred lost his job, his livelihood and his compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with cases in general terms. It is almost inevitable that various companies will be involved. As I have said, the first action was not expected. It was a surprise in the sense that any action being brought is a surprise. It is something that one does not expect. But surely such action would be anticipated in the case that we have discussed, the action having already been taken and the law having been changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were left to the discretion of the court, it could decide whether more hardship was being caused to the defender or the pursuer. I merely seek that the discretion remain so that the case can be examined. In the case heard by the five Judges of Appeal there was no question of sympathy. They recognised that the man had lost compensation on a technicality of Scottish law. We all recognise that and we are changing that area of the law.

This is not a retrospective provision in the normal sense of the word. If it were left to discretion, a fresh action would be taken. The only problem is that one could say that the defendant had certain expenses in the past in defending his case. In this instance the balance of injustice falls the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that I must pursue this matter at a later stage to try to wipe out subsection (3) and to try to overcome the problem on Report or in the Lords. In the meantime, I hope that the Minister will consider not so much what I have said but what he already knows in relation to the case to which I have drawn his attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter need not detain the Committee for long. The position purely and simply is that at present, in an intestacy, the executor-dative, that is the person appointed executor by petition to the court—a procedure with which, surprisingly enough, we are all familiar—has to go through the performance of finding caution. It seems totally illogical that this should be a legal necessity when the entire estate is passing to that person under the prior rights which are enshrined in sections 8 and 9 of the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of finding caution is to indemnify the beneficiary against any wrongdoing by the appointed executor. As the beneficiary and the executor are one and the same person in those circumstances, the only bodies that can profit from this needless precaution are the insurance companies, which gather in the premiums for the policy of caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the effect of the new clause will be that in those circumstances—only

where the executor-dative is the sole beneficiary under the prior rights provision of the intestacy Act—we are waiving, as would be the case with an executor-nominate, the need to obtain a policy of caution. It seems a useful simplifying proposal that I hope will find favour with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a highly technical matter which I know finds favour with the Minister. Therefore, I need not detain the Committee, although for the record I shall explain the amendment. It would amend the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an unfortunate anomaly whereby, owing to drafting mistakes in earlier Acts, clients' money cannot be lodged in a building society although they can be lodged in a bank if they exceed £500. Clearly, there are times when it is advantageous to lodge money in a building society, and the new clause would allow sums over £500 to be lodged in clients' names by the solicitor who holds them in a building society as well as in a bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a more serious matter to be considered—namely, what might happen in a sequestration of a solicitor's estate. Under present law, when the money in the building society deposit or share account, or loaned to a local authority it can—even though it may be specifically earmarked and may be in the name of the client and held in trust for him by the solicitor—fall into the general client account and be appropriated for apportionment among the general body of creditors. The earmarking is therefore ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that sequestrations in those circumstances would be rare, but that that could have unfortunate consequences for the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
These are both highly technical matters. The clause would tidy them up. It contains a sensible suggestion, and would, I believe, make the improvements in the law for which this Bill is designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not kept an accurate count, I think that appropriately seven new clauses that were tabled in the name of the Opposition have been accepted this morning. That must be some sort of a record. I fear it means that our luck has run out for the rest of the day and that we are unlikely to get anything much on the Floor of the House while debating the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. I wish it were otherwise. I know that the Under-Secretary of State, who I thank for his courtesy and help through these proceedings, is always keen to prove that Opposition Members are wrong. I should be delighted to be proved wrong on this occasion, and I hope that our luck will continue for the rest of the day's proeedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that Opposition Members are occasionally right. I hope that the uon. Gentleman will not be too upset by that phenomenon. He said correctly that the new clause extends to building society accounts. It also extends to local authority accounts. The same conditions apply regarding payment of interest and the protection of clients' funds should a sequestration occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons stated by the uon. Gentleman, it is sensible to deal witht his anomaly in the way proposed, and I therefore commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
