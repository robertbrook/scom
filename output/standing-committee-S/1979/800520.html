<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Thursday 22 May at half-past Ten o'clock and, with effect from Tuesday 3 June, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
The proposal has the agreement of the Opposition, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While we on this side of the Committee have always done our very best to accommodate the Government in all that they seek to do, I do not think that we can let this pass without commenting upon it.<br><br>
It must be understood that this sittings motion, generously accepted by this side, results from the ineptitude of the Government in having got themselves into this position. We are still on clause 2 because of the inordinate length of speeches by Government Front Bench speakers, especially those made by the Solicitor-General when he was allowed to speak—apparently he was deprived of that opportunity for the last five sittings but he certainly made up for it on the first two sittings—and because of the ineptitude and failure of the Government to listen to advice from people earlier on so that we were faced time after time with last-minute amendments which should have been in the Bill or on the first list of amendments from the Government.<br><br>
For example, we were told last week that one of the reasons for the failure to understand the crucial question of the handling of children under the Bill was that no one had made any objections. When we examine it, we discover that those involved most closely in the children's panel, the Association of Children's Panels, had themselves been raising the subject but believed that a review had been rejected. Then we are suddenly confronted with a last-minute amendment. This kind
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
of thing has unnecessarily protracted our sittings and the lengths of the debates. Secondly, we discover that the largest Bar association of practising lawyers in Scotland, in its initial memorandum—which was in our hands about two months ago—had made precisely the same point in its recommendations.<br><br>
That is the second reason for delay. The first was the length of speeches from the Government Front Bench. The second was the failure of the Government to listen to discussions over the past year.<br><br>
The third was the failure of the Government to recognise the effect that the Bill would have on other aspects of judicial and criminal procedures. When confronted by the Opposition, they had to run away to bring in amendments. We always welcome the bringing in of amendments by the Government. But almost all were on issues which the Government should have taken into consideration.<br><br>
This is a tyrannical sittings motion, but, as the Minister says, the Opposition accept it because they recognise the impasse to which the Government's foolish actions have brought them. In the interests of law and order, good government and the reputation of the House, we are willing to accept it.<br><br>
The fourth reason is the intransigence with which the Government have opposed meaningful Opposition amendments. The question of detention, which we are discussing, should have been dropped long ago. It has been destroyed, splintered and rejected by all who were practising the law and those who were concerned with social matters and law and order in Scotland.<br><br>
Even more, has it been destroyed by the arguments put by the Opposition.<br><br>
There is no reason why we should not have made progress. We could have finished with clauses 2 and 3 by the second sitting if the Government had listened to us and withdrawn that clause, which at some point in history they will have to do. We are willing to accept the sitting motion to get them out of a mess, but it must be clearly understood that the mess is of their making. I leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p>Clause 27 Detention and questioning at police station.</p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>15 May</i>], No. 139,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0318">Image</span>

in page 4, line 10, after the words last inserted, to add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Subject to section (complaints procedure) below, the provisions of this section and of section 1 above shall come into operation on such day as the Secretary of State may by Order appoint.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9) An Order under subsection (8) above shall not be made until a draft of it has been laid before Parliament and approved by a Resolution of each House of Parliament.".—[<i>Mr. Buchan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following:</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 140, in clause 4, page 4, line 44, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Subject to section (complaints procedure) below, the provisions of this section shall come into operation on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) An order under subsection (5) above shall not be made until a draft of it has been laid before Parliament and approved by a Resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>New clause 4—<i>Complaints procedure.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After that slight break in continuity it would be well to remind the Committee that the amendment that we are considering, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), is important because it suggests the setting up of independent complaints procedure in connection with the police at the same time as any of the rather controversial powers of detention are introduced.<br><br>
It will not surprise the Committee that I rise to support my hon. Friend's amendment. It is a useful debate. I do not expect the Government to say that they will accept the amendment in the form in which it appears on the Notice Paper, I hope that the Under-Secretary will at least approach the matter sympathetically and give some indication that the Government are prepared to move towards an adequate police complaints procedure machinery in Scotland.<br><br>
I start with the perhaps rather simplistic view that there is genuine benefit in an impartial element in a complaints procedure. No one will quarrel with the proposition that the police have a particular place in our society. They are entrusted with very special powers and a position of authority. We are fortunate that those powers are seldom abused. But when they are abused it is of fundamental importance, because of the special position
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
of the police, that investigation is rigorous, thorough and seen to be fair. That is not the present position.<br><br>
I am not making a blanket attack on the integrity of the senior police officers who carry out most of the investigations under the present system. I am perfectly satisfied that the vast majority of the complaints, given the difficulties of investigation, to which I shall refer in a moment, are looked at rigorously and honestly. But, for all that, there is the matter of the perception of the inquiry and the level of public trust in the mechanism. If watchdogs are part of the system which they are supposed to be watching, one is open at least to the charge that justice is not seen to be done, however energetically one may argue that everything possible is done. I believe that trust and confidence in the police are essential to the proper running of our society. It is something that, by and large, we have at the moment and something which we must buttress on all occasions; we must support it and we must strengthen it in the interests of the police themselves and of every citizen working within our present framework of law and order.<br><br>
I would maintain that there is a very strong case for an independent element in this, the most sensitive of all complaints procedures and if that is to be rebutted, it must be rebutted for strong and powerful reasons.<br><br>
I recognise that it may be said that those who argue for this are attempting to introduce some sort of steam hammer to crack a nut. If we look at the report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland for the year ended 31 December 1978, which is the last issue available to us—we do not have the 1979 figures—and turn to table 11 we may, <i>prima facie,</i> get some support for that argument, because it is fair to say that in 1978 there were 1,183 complaints against the police, and although 499 of them—which is a very high percentage—were referred to the procurator-fiscal, only seven of them resulted in prosecutions. The Committee might think that that would suggest that there was no real cause for anxiety in the way in which the present system is working: a high referral to the procurator-fiscal, who is, I willingly concede, totally independent of the police, and at the end of it, when it has been winnowed down and sieved, only seven ended up in court.<br><br>
Again, we can look at the English experience, because the English have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
system with an independent element in their complaints procedure. I would argue that it is really fairly unsatisfactory in form, but it exists. We can look at the report of the Police Complaints Board for 1979. It is interesting that we have the 1979 figures for England whilst we are still struggling for the 1978 figures for Scotland. If that is one result of having an independent element in the complaints procedure, it will be one very happy by-product that we have the figures rather more quickly.<br><br>
If we look at the English experience we find in paragraph 20 that 12,344 complaints were submitted under section 2.1 of their procedure. The Committee will remember that under the English system the independent tribunal sees the cases, and if it disagrees with the findings of the senior police officer about investigation, it can insist on disciplinary proceedings being taken, whatever the police may think. In fairness, one ought to record that, of that massive number, in only 18 cases did the complaints board insist on an independent disciplinary procedure being taken in defiance of the view taken by the police authorities.<br><br>
This is a situation where it could be said that we are worrying about nothing, but that would not be a fair deduction to draw, because we go back to the point about confidence and we also go back to the point about the circumstances in which these complaints arise. In the Scottish figures there were some 358 complaints at the end of 1978 which were still in process, so it is an ongoing matter. The Committee might well think that many of the more difficult cases were likely to have been caught in the pipeline because investigation would be so lengthy.<br><br>
In any event, one of the problems about the present system is that there is a weary cynicism about complaints against the police, which anyone who has been a solicitor in practice in the criminal courts, or, indeed, any MP, will be well aware of. People will come to one the day after the incident very angry, very het up, very indignant. The procedure is explained to them, and it slowly comes home to them that the investigation against the police is being carried out by the police. This is a great tendency after a little while, particularly as inevitably—I do not necessarily make a complaint about this—the investigation itself is unpleasant. It obviously involves the complainant being put through the mill in terms of very careful question-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
ing, which is very proper because allegations against the police are serious matters. It may also involve friends of the complainant being put in this difficult position where they almost see themselves as being in the dock. That is, perhaps, part of the necessary process. But when people consider the inconvenience and difficulties of this process and see that there is no independent element in it, often—I have seen this again and again, and I am sure the Solicitor-General has seen it—the general attitude is "What's the point? The game's no' worth the candle. We're not going through with this—we are just going to drop it."<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
There is a high number of cases, in my experience, which on the face of it are serious and solid complaints, but fall by the wayside. The cynicism to which I have referred, which contributes to this, is very bad for the police and for the health of the whole public perception of police procedures. It is very difficult anyway to investigate a police complaint, because by definition there is seldom any corroboration. The classic police complaint is something that happens in a police cell, or a police van, and the only witnesses apart from the complainant himself are likely to be the two or three policemen against whom he is making allegations. I accept that it is human nature to stand by peer group loyalty. It exists in the police as it exists in any other section of society. I accept that however careful we are about investigation, many of the complaints will run into the sand, leaving behind them just a lingering doubt in the minds of those who have been investigating. If there had been other people there, the corroboration would not have been lacking.<br><br>
The important point is that an enormous number—much larger than are revealed in the figures which I have quoted—simply drop out of the system because of this disillusionment about the total lack of an independent element in the procedure. Therefore, the public perception of the police is damaged, and also the safeguards to the police themselves.<br><br>
The most worrying police complaint case that I ever came across involved a policeman who was dismissed from the force after an internal discipline inquiry which had no independent element. As I discovered after correspondence with the chief constable, the young man had never
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
been given an adequate explanation of why he had been dismissed from the force. I had a confidential letter telling me why he had been dismissed, but also conceding that it had not been thought wise to tell the man himself. When we talk of an independent element in complaints procedures in the police, we should be thinking about the policeman who is himself at risk, as well the fate of members of the public.<br><br>
I do not want to labour the point. I have, I hope, made my position clear. It may be said that it would be wildly expensive. I admit that I do not like the English system, which I think is a rather uncomfortable half-way house, but at least it accepts the principle. It is interesting to note that in 1979, with that massive number of 12,000 complaints, it was done with a total staff of 32, on a budget of under £400,000. I am not suggesting that one could have a pro rata cut in the Scottish figures, but if the English could manage at least some sort of independence input on that very modest budget—well under £500,000 and a staff of only 32—we are not necessarily talking about wildly expensive innovations in Scottish terms. It would be a small price to pay if it did something to reinforce trust in the police.<br><br>
I said earlier that we have a great deal of confidence generally in the police force. All hon. Members receive a little magazine occasionally which gives us digests of all the polls that currently appear in Britain. I notice that in the last one there was what was called an honesty score, in which the poll took the public perceptions of various professions. The police came out extremely well, edging in just behind doctors, who led all the rest. It will be no surprise to members of this Committee to know that Members of Parliament appeared with a very large negative score. The only people who do worse are trade union leaders. I do not want to give too much comfort to the Opposition Benches by going into that. My point is that the police have a good image. The vast majority deserve a good image in this country, but we could do something to ensure that that happy state of affairs continued if we were to look seriously at introducing an independent complaints procedure.<br><br>
I finish with a brief quotation from the report of the Police Complaints Board in England:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our report for 1978 covered the first full year of our consideration of complaints cases. In 1979
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
we have been conscious of our growing familiarity with the nature of police activities and procedures and we have felt increased confidence in our understanding of the views of complainants and of the police."</p></blockquote>
Then it goes on to give its considered judgment:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our respect for the overall integrity of the police approach to complaints is maintained, but our experience has strengthened our conviction of the value of a scrutiny of complaints by lay people."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Office would be well advised to listen to that voice of experience, and I hope that we shall have an encouraging response to the very reasonably and valuable amendment which my hon. Friend had tabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regard these as probably the most important amendments to come before the Committee during its consideration of the Bill. What surprises me about the amendments and the discussion surrounding them is that those people who have been generating a great deal of interest in the Bill, and in many cases a great deal of opposition to it, have not picked up these amendments as being crucial to the establishment of confidence if and when the Bill goes on to the statute book. I am very surprised that there has not been a greater degree of public interest in the content of these amendments and in the thinking behind them.<br><br>
I shall continue where my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) left off, by saying that it would be a great mistake, a fundamental error, for anybody to think that because in Scotland there were only 1,183 complaints against the police and only 17 of them eventually found their way into court, there was no problem about the way in which complaints against the police are handled, and about the confidence that people have as to whether these complaints are handled properly.<br><br>
Even if the Bill were not being considered in Committee, there would be a strong case for considering the possibility of introducing an independent element into the complaints about police procedures throughout Scotland. So the proposals contained in these two amendments and in new clause 4 could stand on their own, even if the Bill were not before the House, but because we are considering the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] we are under an obligation to consider these proposals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
in relation to the Bill. So while I want to speak about the proposals on their own, clearly the main burden of my remarks will be concentrated on the need to accept the concept of the amendments. If the drafting is defective—as Opposition amendments are so often declared to be—that really should not be a deterrent to the Government's coming forward with properly drafted provisions, and they should be prepared to accept the principles contained in the amendments and in new clause 4.<br><br>
I shall begin by giving a quotation from the speech of the Secretary of State for Scotland to the annual conference of the Scottish Police Federation at Peebles. As an aside, although I do not wish to be unkind, I must say that this was one of the most patronising speeches that I have ever read in my life. The police are very intelligent people, and there is no point in seeking to persuade them that everything in the cupboard is lovely, and that there are no problems. It was a very patronising speech, but nevertheless it contained the following interesting passage:
<br><blockquote><p>"Other provisions in the Bill"</p></blockquote>
—the Secretary of State is obviously referring to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"are directed to the same end."</p></blockquote>
What the Secretary of State was talking about there was the need to tilt the balance back in favour of the police. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Thomson Committee Report on which so much of the Bill is based recommended that the police should be given a power of limited detention to investigate crime. The Bill confers such a power."</p></blockquote>
That is the power we are debating in this clause. The Secretary of State goes on to ask:
<br><blockquote><p>"What reason does the innocent man have to fear a provision of this nature?"</p></blockquote>
Then he goes on to make a most astonishing statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"At most he will suffer some minor inconvenience if he is wrongly suspected and briefly detained."</p></blockquote>
A "minor inconvenience", if he is briefly detained in a police station, with no grounds at all, and wrongly suspected. The Secretary of State uses the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"At most he will suffer some minor inconvenience if he is wrongly suspected and briefly detained. That seems a small price to pay for the increased assurance of the effective investigation of crime and the conviction of the criminal."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
I happen to agree with the Secretary of State that the numbers involved who are wrongly suspected and, therefore, wrongly detained will be small. That is no good reason for saying that we ought not to do anything to try to deal with the situation where even a small number of people are wrongly suspected and wrongly detained—to use the Secretary of State's own words. Even if the numbers are small, Parliament has an obligation to take account of the problem that even those small numbers will throw up.<br><br>
It is for that reason that I am strongly in favour of the proposals put by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and my other hon. Friends. I was interested in the Solicitor-General's intervention on Tuesday when he gave, in my view, a wrong impression that nearly all the complaints went to the procurator-fiscal. When my hon. Friend asked who decided whether they went to the procurator-fiscal, we really did not receive an answer. What happens at the moment, when complaints are made against the police, is that the chief constable does not even see them. The matter is dealt with by the deputy assistant chief constable. He either investigates the matter himself or, more often than not, appoints a senior police officer, normally a chief superintendent, to investigate the complaint and then report to the deputy assistant chief constable.<br><br>
At that stage the deputy assistant chief constable may decide on a number of courses of action. He may decide that there has, as the Solicitor-General said, been a breach of the law, as distinct from police discipline code procedures, and, therefore, it is a matter for the procurator-fiscal to decide. At that stage he would send the complaint to the procurator-fiscal, and rightly, as far as the police were concerned, that would be the end of the matter, unless, of course, the matter went to court and the police officer was found guilty, when the police discipline code procedures would come into effect.<br><br>
It may well be that the complaint is not of a criminal nature but relates entirely to police discipline code procedures. The deputy assistant chief constable would then consider whether he should refer the matter to the chief constable, not for a finding of guilt or innocence but for disposal as regards the action which should be taken in relation to the police discipline procedures. The only time the chief con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
stable sees the complaint is when he comes to dispense the discipline as a result of the deputy assistant chief constable sending the complaint to him.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden says that a number of people come to see MPs. We have all had the experience of constituents coming and complaining about actions of the police. Equally, we have all had the experience—this is more often than not the case—where three weeks later one gets a letter from the deputy assistant chief constable who tells one that the complaint has been withdrawn and that is the end of the matter. But that does not satisfy Mr or Mrs A, B or C. They still have the feeling that the complaint has not been properly investigated. Whether one likes it or not, the procedure for dealing with complaints against the police is totally unsatisfactory.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I cannot understand why we should have this system in England and Wales of an independent element in the complaints against the police and yet the Government should be so hesitant about introducing it in Scotland. Even when the present Government were in opposition, they were equally hesitant about this matter. I cannot understand why the Government should be so hesitant about introducing an independent element in complaints against the police in Scotland. I am getting sick and tired of having to defend their Bill. If the Ministers and the Government want confidence in the Bill, they had better start to do something themselves to generate some confidence among the people of Scotland that this Bill is not the Draconian Bill that people fear it might be.<br><br>
Whether we like it or not, as parliamentarians we are still faced with the position that there is little or no support for the Bill. I regret that, because I am in favour of 90 per cent. of it. I am in favour of all the clauses that I introduced when I had ministerial responsibility for this matter. I have not voted against anything that I was in favour of in the last Parliament, nor will I do so. But that does not solve the problem that the Government have been unable to generate any confidence for their own Bill.<br><br>
We are becoming sick and tired of the way in which this whole matter is being handled. Every time we hand the Government a lifeline or give them an oppor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
tunity to generate some confidence in the Bill, it is just brushed aside as being unimportant, as not mattering—there are only 1,100 people involved; what do they matter?<br><br>
The Secretary of State says what does it matter if somebody suffers a minor inconvenience because he has been wrongfully detained. What way is that to generate confidence in a piece of legislation? The Government have a golden opportunity to grasp the opportunity that they are being given by my hon. Friends and myself at least to generate some confidence in the Bill and give it a chance to succeed, but they seem determined not to do so.<br><br>
What would an independent element in complaints against the police actually consist of? We are under an obligation to say not only what should happen but what it should consist of. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, I am certainly not in favour of the top-heavy bureaucratic system that they have in England and Wales. I think we have an advantage in Scotland. All members of the Committee recognise that we have the advantage of the procurator-fiscal system in Scotland. Whereas in England and Wales the police prosecute a fairly large number of their own cases, in Scotland the procurator-fiscal is the prosecution service. So to a certain extent we have the independent element.<br><br>
From my own experience, I know that police officers, particularly in Scotland, are worried about the problem of double jeopardy. A policeman will ask why he should be faced with the rigours of the police discipline code and then, at the end of the day, if that is not satisfactory to the complainant, the matter is taken through the courts for further procedure. I believe that to be a very real fear with which we are under an obligation to deal.<br><br>
So I suggest what was agreed by the Police Advisory Board when I was responsible for this matter. In my time, we submitted a paper to the Police Advisory Board in Scotland to suggest that an independent element should be introduced into complaints against the police procedure. As members of the Committee know, the Police Advisory Board is made up of a multifarious group of people. It obviously includes the police associations, the Association of Chief Police Officers of Scotland, the Superintendents Association, and the Police Federation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
None of the police associations was in favour of introducing an independent element into complaints against police procedures. But everybody else on the Police Advisory Board, a body set up to advise the Secretary of State for Scotland, was in favour of introducing the independent element. At the end of the day, after one or two meetings when we had fairly serious and detailed discussions, the position of the police associations emerged as being that, while they were not in favour of the independent element being introduced, if it had to be introduced the proposals contained in the document that I put to the Police Advisory Board were acceptable.<br><br>
These proposals were, first, that where someone complained against the police and the matter was eventually sent forward, the existing procedure would continue until the matter was disposed of to the procurator-fiscal. Of course, if the matter is sent to the procurator-fiscal, he is the independent element and that complaint would in no circumstances go to the independent body for consideration. There would be no question of a complaint being sent to the procurator-fiscal and then somehow or other finding itself before this independent body.<br><br>
Where the normal procedures that are presently in being were followed—in other words, where the case went to the deputy assistant chief constable and the assistant decided that it was a matter for the chief constable to dispose of in terms of the police discipline code—the complainant would, even at that stage, be approached and asked if he was content to allow the chief constable to dispose of the matter within the terms of the police discipline code, or whether he wanted the matter sent to the independent body. So there was another checkpoint along the road. Even where the complaint had been considered and investigated and the deputy chief constable had decided that there was a case to answer, and it was now for the chief constable to dispose of it within the framework of the police discipline code, the complainant would be approached again, and would get the opportunity to say whether he wanted the chief constable to dispose of the matter within the discipline code or whether he wanted the independent body to look at the complaint.<br><br>
If the complainant said that he wanted the chief constable to dispose of the matter, again there can be no question of double jeopardy, the chief constable would dispose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
of the matter and the complainant would obviously have to accept whatever decision was made. If the complainant decided that the complaint should be referred to the independent body, the new procedures would take over only at that stage.<br><br>
All the safeguards were built in, even to the extent that in the short Bill that was prepared there was a clause which stated that malicious complaints against the police would be offences that would be prosecuted. I know that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is anxious about unfounded allegations against the police. We are all anxious about unfounded allegations. It is necessary to deter that sort of thing and also to give people confidence in the procedures. A proposal was accepted that malicious complaints would be considered and would be referred to the procurator-fiscal, and that it would be for the procurator-fiscal to decide whether a malicious complaint of this nature should be proceeded against.<br><br>
All the safeguards were built in and we were able to assure the three police associations that there was no possibility whatever of double jeopardy where a complainant had decided to adopt one procedure and changed his mind and adopted the other procedure. We had eliminated any possibility of that happening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend a question concerning what he describes as malicious complaint? Is he suggesting in his proposals that complaints would be sent up to the independent element to decide whether they were malicious? If not, it seems that it is taking an unfortunate track.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure why my hon. Friend is worried. Obviously, he is worried about the proposals I am putting, but it is not a worry that could not be resolved. It may well be that the way to resolve that worry is to decide whether the independent element should consider whether the complaint is malicious. But the one thing we could not allow to happen—I say this in all sincerity to my hon. Friends as well as to other members of the Committee—was the development of a position in which people complained without any foundation. Just as present complaints against police procedure do not instil any great confidence in those who have cause for complaint, neither would the new procedures if there were opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
unfounded complaints. That situation would have to be dealt with. We should not back away from it.<br><br>
The Police Advisory Board—I do not want to inhibit or compromise the three police associations in Scotland—was, and I suppose still is, in favour of an independent element in the complaints procedure. I shall not go so far as to say that in the last Parliament the Bill was not introduced because we ran out of time. The Opposition know that the Bill was never introduced because we were a minority Government. We took the usual soundings and we were made aware that there would not be a majority to carry the Bill through the House. I shall go no further than that. But that is the main reason why the Bill was never introduced.<br><br>
Nevertheless, we have moved on a fair way since then. I come back to one of my original points, that, whether the Government like it or not, the Criminal Justice Bill in the last Parliament did not generate the kind of antagonism that this Bill generates. That is primarily because the last Criminal Justice Bill did not contain some of the proposals that are in this Bill. The Government have made no effort whatever to allay the fears and resolve the doubts of the many people—a great many in their own party: there was evidence of that in the debates at Perth, to which I referred at the last sitting—who have serious doubts about the efficacy of this legislation.<br><br>
The proposals for an independent element could stand on its own, without any shadow of doubt. It has now assumed much greater importance because of the introduction of the Bill and the powers that it proposes. If the Government want to give people confidence in the Bill, they have here an opportunity.<br><br>
I do not expect the Minister to accept the assurances that I have given him about the views of the Police Advisory Board, but I expect him to tell the Police Advisory Board that he is prepared to accept the principle of the independent element in the complaints procedure. Let us put a paper to the Police Advisory Board, discuss it in detail, and come back on Report with detailed proposals. That would be acceptable to the Committee.<br><br>
What is not acceptable is for the Minister to say that he is not prepared even to take it to the Police Advisory Board. Parliamentarians are not the fount of all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
wisdom. If the Police Advisory Board has any function or role in advising on police matters in Scotland, I hope it goes beyond the question of whether police officers should be able to wear open-necked shirts when it is a bit sunny and warm. The Police Advisory Board has a more meaningful role to play. We should take the views of the board on many of these important issues.<br><br>
It is not just the Labour Party—all-important though it is in Scotland—which says that there should be an independent element. A whole host of people are anxious that we should resolve the worries—the suspicion, perhaps—about the way in which complaints against the police are handled.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I will finish with two points. It is not just this legislation that would gain in stature and confidence if these proposals were accepted. The kind of proposal put by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) would bring a great deal of confidence to the police force itself. I remember well the case that my hon. Friend raised, because I sent him the confidential letter telling him why his constituent had been dismissed from the police force.<br><br>
I remember another case when, once the papers had been submitted to us, we were so horrified at the decision that had been taken under the existing procedures—this was an internal discipline matter—that we ourselves sent the matter to the sheriff.<br><br>
The only time in my understanding when a Secretary of State has sent an internal discipline case to a sheriff was by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). It involved Strathclyde police, and the sheriff finally disposed of it in a vastly different way from the proposals that were put to us coming from the normal police discipline procedures that exist at present. For goodness sake, do not let us have anyone saying that there is no problem. There is a problem, and if we bury our heads in the sand all we shall do is discredit ourselves.<br><br>
The Government have this opportunity to generate some confidence in their own Bill by, if not accepting the detailed proposals, at least accepting the principle. The Minister will disappoint not only this Committee—he might not consider that important—but many people in Scotland, probably the vast majority of them. Before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
he brushes these proposals aside, the Minister is under an obligation to say that he is prepared to take this matter to the Police Advisory Board for its further consideration and that if it accepts the principle, he will introduce the necessary amendments on Report. He should go further and say that he himself accepts the principle, because this would do a great deal not only to generate confidence in the Bill but for the confidence of police officers themselves.<br><br>
Every hon. Member on this Committee knows of a number of cases where the procedures which have been followed have not satisfied constituents or MPs. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) pursued a case over about two and a half years, and there are numerous cases like that. We ought not to deceive ourselves into believing that everything in the garden is lovely, when in fact there are improvements that we can make.<br><br>
We are not suggesting a great bureaucratic structure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden says. I have suggested a much simpler and much less expensive approach, but one which, in my view, would fit the circumstances in Scotland against the background that we have the procurator-fiscal service. I hope that the Minister will see the wisdom of these proposals and be prepared to accept the principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the Opposition spokesman has given us the view of the Opposition, it is appropriate that I reply on behalf of the Government.<br><br>
It is probably correct that the vast proportion of the debate that has taken place so far has been not so much on a complaints procedure in regard to the circumstances of clause 2, although reference has been made to that, but, in effect, about the general question of whether Scotland should have a police complaints board. It is right that the debate should have been largely on those lines, but, in all seriousness, hon. Members will accept that it would be extremely anomalous and slightly foolish to have a complaints procedure which existed only for certain kinds of complaint arising out of certain kinds of police activity. Either there should be a general complaints procedure of the kind proposed, or one should not apply in the first place.<br><br>
The hon. Member who speaks for the Opposition in these matters gave us a very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
detailed account of the previous Government's thinking, but he slightly misled the Committee as to what actually happened under the previous Government. We know that the previous Government, despite complaints from the police about their proposals in England and Wales, did legislate. They asked for, and obtained approval of Parliament for, a Police Complaints Board for England and Wales, which was set up at that time and which has been operating since then. The hon. Gentleman suggested that no such Bill had been introduced in Scotland, and I had that checked, because it did not accord with my recollection. In fact, on 29 November 1976 the previous Government introduced a police complaints Bill for Scotland. It had its First Reading but made no progress thereafter. We must ask ourselves why the previous Government, having introduced a Bill on lines very similar to the Bill which was proceeded with for England and Wales, subsequently withdrew it and made no attempt to proceed with it. They did not include it in their election manifesto for the last general election, and only today for the first time have we heard from the hon. Gentleman that the Opposition are apparently once again in favour of legislating for this type of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's briefing is totally wrong. The proposals to be introduced for Scotland bore no resemblance at all to the English and Welsh proposals. The panel of independents—if one may call it that—was to be only three strong, and only one of these at a time would sit in the set-up that was envisaged. It was a much simpler proposal. It bore no resemblance at all to the other Bill. The Minister has said that the Bill was introduced and that it had its First Reading. People reading the <i>Official Report</i> of this debate might assume that that meant that the matter was debated. But every parliamentarian knows that when a Bill is introduced and has its First Reading not a word is spoken about the contents of the Bill. It does the Minister no credit to seek to write into the record a misleading statement such as that. He knows perfectly well why the Bill made no progress. I have explained that we were made aware that there was not a majority in the House at that time to carry the Bill. There is no shame in explaining that that is the reason we did not proceed with it. If we could have put that Bill on the statute book we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
have done so. The Minister should have no illusions about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Scottish Bill was far simpler than the English one, it is even more remarkable that the then Government did not proceed with it and get parliamentary approval for it. If Parliament was prepared to approve a far more complicated and burdensome procedure for England and Wales, it seems remarkable that the Government were unable to proceed with a nice, simple, straightforward, commonsense solution for Scotland, The hon. Gentleman said that that very simple, straightforward Bill was nevertheless withdrawn because it became clear that there would be no parliamentary support for it. But he made the point that Parliament did not have an opportunity to discuss the matter. It is not as though there were great debates in Parliament in which it was made abundantly clear that the Bill would collapse in Parliament. No attempt was made by the previous Government to proceed with it. The situation is not simply that there would have been problems in Parliament, because that did not prevent the English Bill going forward, but that clearly there was very little support from anyone in Scotland for a Bill of this kind.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should also indicate, if he wishes to maintain his position, why proposals for an independent police complaints procedure were not included in the Labour Party's election manifesto for Scotland, and why they have never been mentioned by any representative of the Official Opposition until the debate this morning. Perhaps he could comment on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that that is not true. Time and time again the previous Government made public statements about the need to introduce an independent element; indeed, we had a press conference about it when we were introducing that Bill. So the Minister has it wrong. What astonishes me about his speech this morning is that he does not appear to remember the Bill. He is telling us that the Bill was introduced on 29 November in such and such a year. The Minister was a Member of the previous Parliament. He had resigned from the Opposition Front Bench because at that time he was in favour of devolution, although now he is not. I assumed that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
because of his interest in these matters he would at least have seen the Bill. It was a short, simple, eight-clause Bill—not a big Bill—but the Minister does not seem to remember having seen it. He seems to be speaking against the background that he did not even know that such a Bill existed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can go on as long as he likes but he is actually conceding to the Committee that the previous Government, which successfully proceeded with an independent police complaints procedure for England and Wales and put through a controversial Bill, voluntarily withdrew a much simpler and more straightforward Bill for Scotland. Yet today Labour Members seek to maintain in opposition that that is something which would be appropriate and desirable.<br><br>
It is right that the Committee should consider why the previous Government withdrew their Bill and why the present Government have no intention of introducing a similar Bill. The situation in Scotland is, as the previous Government realised, very different from the situation south of the border. There are a number of areas where these differences are manifest. The most obvious is, and has been for many years, an independent element in questions of complaints against the police. In England and Wales, because the police themselves decide whether prosecutions should be brought—whether against members of the public or against police officers—it is always a matter of controversy whether the police can be the proper judges in their own cause. In Scotland, because of the procurator-fiscal's very special position, that is a problem that does not arise. That is one major difference between the situation in Scotland and that south of the border.<br><br>
We are also dealing with an enormously different scale of problem. It is very important that the Committee should be aware of this. Let me just mention to the Committee the actual level of complaints in England compared with the level of complaints in Scotland and how these complaints are developing. In 1978 in England and Wales the total number of complaints was 28,234. In Scotland in the same year the total number of complaints was 1,157. Even taking into account differences of population, that suggests a number of complaints in England and Wales almost three times as great as that in Scotland.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The population is five times as great.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not actually five times as great. The population of England and Wales is not 25 million, which I should have thought the Opposition spokesman would have appreciated. It is at least eight times as great—maybe 10 or 11 times as great. This is exactly the point which I am trying to make to the hon. Gentleman. Even taking into account population differences, the level of complaints in England and Wales against the police is almost three times as high as that in Scotland in 1978.<br><br>
When we look at the figures for 1979—and I am able to give the Committee the provisional figures for 1979—we see something even more interesting. In England and Wales the figure has gone up from 28,234 in 1978 to 29,383. In Scotland, however, the figure has actually gone down from 1,157 to 942. Therefore, at a time when complaints against the police in England and Wales are far greater in number than in Scotland, we are seeing a situation where the number of complaints in Scotland has actually decreased in the most recent year for which we now have figures available. The whole scale of the matter, therefore, is very different, and the trend, so far as we can tell, is also different.<br><br>
There is another important consideration to which Opposition Members did not address themselves when speaking in favour of their amendments. If we were to have in Scotland a separate police complaints board, the only justification for it would be that in the Scottish context our existing system is less likely to find proved legitimate complaints against the police. We are now in the privileged position of being able to look at the effect which the Police Complaints Board has actually had in England and Wales and see how that compares with the situation in Scotland. It is a very constructive examination to make, and the Committee will be very interested in what an examination of these figures reveals.<br><br>
In 1978 in England and Wales, of the complaints which were not withdrawn and where the Police Complaints Board, therefore, had to initiate a full inquiry, some 10.2 per cent. of the inquiries concluded that the complaint was substantiated or that proceedings were required to be taken against an individual police constable or constables. In Scotland in the same year, without any independent police com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
plaints board procedure, the figure was not 10.2 per cent. but 12.1 per cent. Therefore, without a separate police complaints board, of the Scottish figures in 1978, as a result of independent inquiries by the police and the involvement of the procurator-fiscal, a higher proportion of complaints were substantiated.<br><br>
Whatever else these figures show, it cannot be argued that the establishment of a Police Complaints Board in England and Wales has led to a substantial increase—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will speak to any of his English colleagues who take an interest in these matters and will look at the figures published by the Police Complaints Board last week and the press reports on these matters, he will see that there is very great concern among those who originally favoured a Police Complaints Board that it seems to have had virtually no effect whatsoever in increasing the proportion of complaints which are actually substantiated against the police.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is seriously wanting us to involve ourselves in considerable trouble, expense and controversy in order to establish a separate procedure which at the end of the day will have no more different result from that which operates at the moment, he is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. He knows it, and the Committee knows it. What we have at the moment is a situation in Scotland where our existing police complaints procedure involving the procurator-fiscal certainly produces a comparable result with that in England and Wales with the Police Complaints Board. If the 1978 figures are anything to go by, they suggest that there is actually a slightly higher level of substantiation of complaints in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon. Gentleman define the efficiency of the police? Is it when crime and provable crime are increasing or when crime and provable crime are going down? There is an analogy which he might think through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the efficiency of the police is normally gauged by their ability to detect crime and to detect the offender responsible for that crime.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more crime there is, the more efficient the police are?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not necessarily follow, but what is certainly of interest is that, over the last couple of years, at a time when the level of crime has been increasing, in Scotland at least the number of complaints against the police has decreased. The hon. Gentleman seems to refuse to accept that, but it is quite clear from the figures.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen have made fine rhetorical speeches but there was not one iota of hard evidence to support their basic contention. I agree entirely that there could be various reasons for the figures. I freely accept that, but I think that the hon. Member for Garscadden must accept that, if the figures show anything, they support the Government's view and not his own. We can ignore the figures and say that we are not interested in such evidence as is available, that we have a deep personal passionate belief in an independent police complaints board, irrespective of any effect that it might have. The hon. Gentleman may take that view but if he is interested in evidence, I should have thought that at least the hon. Member for Garscadden, if not one of his hon. Friends, was interested in the practical effect of proposals of this kind.<br><br>
When we have a situation where such evidence as exists indicates, first, that the problem of complaints against the police is dramatically less in Scotland than elsewhere in the country, and that the existing procedure at the very least results in a similar proportion of complaints being substantiated, on what particular advantage or argument and in particular on what evidence is he founding to support his view that we should have a complete new bureaucratic structure of the kind proposed in the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a splendid series of pejorative phrases, such as "bureaucratic structure". The hon. Gentleman will not accept, but it must be within his knowledge, that there is a considerable amount of public disquiet. Very often one meets clients as a lawyer, or constituents as an MP, who ask "What is the point?" There is an obvious and clear-cut interest in justice being seen to be done. The arguments that the hon. Gentleman is advancing would be arguments against an independent complaints procedure in almost
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
any professional closed shop. I do not see why the police should be privileged in this sense. I should have thought that there was an obvious cause for saying that one should not examine what is happening on one's own midden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there were great public cynicism about whether it is worth complaining to the police in Scotland because we do not have an independent police complaints board, again the evidence points to the opposite. In England and Wales, with a Police Complaints Board, 45.9 per cent. of original complaints were withdrawn before they reached the board. In Scotland, without any independent board and in the knowledge that they would not be dealt with by an independent body, only 29.8 per cent. were withdrawn. So, without an independent board, Scotland has actually far fewer complaints withdrawn, and therefore presumably the complainant has felt that it was worth going through the appropriate procedure. Again, in 1979, on the provisional figures, in England, with this marvellous new Police Complaints Board, 47.4 per cent. of complaints were withdrawn before they reached the board, whereas as in Scotland the figure was only 28.8 per cent.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must listen to the facts of the matter, as he normally does. Unless he has other facts which contradict that, he and his hon. Friends should appreciate that there is not one iota of evidence to which the Committee have been asked to listen to substantiate the arguments he has put forward. For various reasons which perhaps I do not understand, the fact still remains that the position in Scotland is far better than the position in England and Wales, in that those who make complaints to the police in the first place are not as inclined as they are in England and Wales to withdraw those complaints, although they know that there is no independent board to look at them, and, at the end of the day, a higher proportion of complaints are substantiated by the police themselves than in England and Wales with this independent police board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the experience of the Police Complaints Board in England is long and the conclusion that there is positive virtue in independent scrutiny is misplaced? Would he think there was any virtue in having an

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
Ombudsman to look at Civil Service and local government matters? It seems to me that one could construct this kind of argument almost certainly to say that we should also get rid of that kind of nasty bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying—and I think that anyone in England and Wales who has looked at the way the Police Complaints Board has operated has also come to this conclusion—that the existence of that board has had no appreciable effect one way or the other on the total number of complaints, on the way in which these complaints are dealt with, or on the proportion of complaints which are ultimately substantiated by the complaints board. In other words, it is not that it has had a bad effect but that it has had no discernible effect one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be other reasons for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be other reasons, but if the hon. Gentleman is asking Parliament to approve a new procedure for Scotland, we are entitled to come to our view on the basis of such evidence as is available at the moment. The hon. Gentleman is saying, in effect, that he accepts that the evidence is against his argument but there are other factors, that although he is not quite clear what they are or what they conclude, he nevertheless insists on his own personal prejudice that the existence of a board would clearly benefit the situation in Scotland.<br><br>
I am basing my argument on the facts that exist. Labour Members are basing their arguments on rhetoric and nothing else. It is on that basis that I am happy to advise the Committee and my hon. Friends that there would be no benefit in having the amendment. I do not question for a moment the sincerity of Labour Members in wishing to improve the complaints procedure in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have statistical proof of our sincerity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not. It is based on exactly the same faith that the hon. Gentleman's arguments in support of his amendment were based. It cannot be proved one way or the other.<br><br>
In all seriousness, the hon. Gentleman will accept that the Committee is entitled
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
to take into account the actual evidence, such as it is, and the evidence, such as it is, is overwhelmingly against the amendments that we are presently discussing, and for that reason I cannot commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Under-Secretary has made the case that he has made, because I am bound to say that I think that it overlooks a very important factor, and that is that the Bill fundamentally changes criminal procedure in Scotland. Whereas all this evidence—"evidence as such" is how the Minister describes it—refers to a situation that will not exist if the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill becomes the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, because of the changes that it makes the case for an independent element in complaints machinery is made. I hope the Government will feel able to take account of the arguments that we have put forward and not lean on the very dubious statistics which have been brought forward by the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
Some of us have been advocating an independent element in complaints machinery for a very long time, and it is certainly not a new idea. Despite what has just been said, I believe that public confidence in the police is assisted by having a complaints board, as there is in England and Wales. Looking through the structure of that complaints machinery, I firmly believe that that would add to the confidence which the public ought to have in the police, because, after all, the complaints board produces a report which contains statistics—and the Under-Secretary has made a great deal of some of these statistics. Even if that complaints board has not been to the general advantage of society, as he seems to be advocating, he thinks it has been of some advantage to him this morning. Therefore, I suggest to the Under-Secretary that it is an advantage to have a board that investigates the complaints and produces statistics, because from that we are able to determine what steps we, as a society, will take to improve our police service and improve the confidence which the public ought to have in that service.<br><br>
There would, of course, be disadvantages for the police. There is no escape from that. The internal investigation that goes on in Scotland at the present time holds certain comfort for the police force but none for Members of Parliament who have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
the job of representing constituents who come to us with very serious complaints against the police. We have difficulty in getting these processed in a way that the aggrieved constituents understand or accept. It is important to get away from that and get out into the open. Also one would have to accept that the chief constable's position as the head of a highly disciplined organisation would be reduced somewhat. I am prepared to pay that price but I am not certain that the police are. But certainly the chief constable and his force—as he is the head of that force—would become accountable elsewhere. That is a new dimension which may not be acceptable to the police, but it is certainly worth while.<br><br>
The advantage would be that it would take the heat out of situations in which police conduct is challenged. I want to see that because there have been complaints against the police in very small communities in my constituency and I have not been satisfied that the procedure that was followed for looking into them was satisfactory. The police service should be made open, like all other public services. There is an Ombudsman who looks into the conduct of local government officers. That should apply with equal force to other public services such as the Civil Service, where charges of maladministration have to go to independent scrutiny. I can see no reason why the police should be thought of as in a different position. I have heard no arguments this morning to tell us why they are in a different position.<br><br>
I see a complaints board as a source of conciliation. In our society there are worrying tensions in a number of areas—tensions of the kind produced by religious differences, by race, and by social deprivation. Every now and again they spill over, the police are involved, and complaints against them flow from that. If there were a complaints board, it would add to the components of conciliation which we have already built up. Open government and open services are an advantage. To add to public confidence is always appropriate.<br><br>
Most important, the evidence about the value of a police complaints board which has been offered this morning relates to a situation in which the Bill is not an Act, but when it is on the statute book the powers of the police will be radically changed. When they have the powers proposed in the Bill, the question of com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
plaints will become different and the case for an independent element will be sustained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) has put his finger on two vital points. The statistics advanced by the Minister are hardly relevant, as they refer to the status quo and not to the position that will exist when the Bill is enacted. There will be an entirely new situation and it is wrong to pretend otherwise, otherwise there is no reason for the introduction of the Bill.<br><br>
The fact that the procedures were not very much used and that, in the view of the Minister, there was a satisfactory conclusion to most of the cases, also seems hardly to matter because, in that case, there would be no enormous bureaucratic set-up. The vital point is that there would be much greater public confidence. Rightly or wrongly, the public does not believe that procedures of this kind should be dealt with by the profession or the people concerned. Many of us believe that the General Medical Council would have to have unusually strong evidence before it found proved a fault against a doctor.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
We all know that, whatever we might say about individuals in other parties or even in our own, in the House we close the ranks against outsiders when attacks are made on politicians. It is a very natural human reaction. Therefore, it would be much more satisfactory, in view of some of the powers that would be given in the Bill, for the public to know that any abuse would be dealt with by an entirely independent tribune. I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) winds up on his own amendment, we ought to place on record that the Minister's reply to the debate this morning was probably the weakest of the replies that we have heard in the weeks that we have been in this Committee. I suspect that most of his hon. Friends, while they will support him out of loyalty, will not support him from any great conviction in the weight of his argument.<br><br>
The Minister produced a bunch of statistics dealing first with figures and then switching quickly to percentages, which just goes to prove the old adage that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Once I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
hear someone switching from specific figures to percentages, I am immediately suspicious. What the Minister could not measure, either in specific figures or in percentages—a point put by the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) and, before that, by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg)—is the relationship between the police and the public. Again, the Government should be warned that it is they themselves who are developing this whole argument into a debate of police versus people. We on the Opposition side are striving might and main to set up a situation where it can be police and people.<br><br>
One gets the impression, on going through these debates, that the Government are just as determined to create a situation where it is police against people. The kind of argument put by the Minister takes no account of the good relations that we are trying to establish to give the Bill a fair wind, and brushes aside all the arguments without even trying to answer them. He did not even produce one argument against the detail that all my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for the Western Isles have put during the whole debate. There is an independent element in the complaints against the Government. There is an independent element in the complaints against local government. There is an independent element in the complaints against the Health Service. Even with regard to the point that the right hon. Gentleman made on the decision whether a doctor should be struck off, there is an independent element in that decision as well. Lo and behold, there is even an independent element in complaints against the legal profession.<br><br>
Yet here this morning we have the Minister holding up his hands with "Oh, no! Not the police. We cannot have any independent element in the complaints against them. We keep them aside." Then the Minister wonders why we are saying that the Government are responsible for developing a debate about the police versus the people. If that does develop, and there is every sign that it will, the responsibility for that is with the Government.<br><br>
The Minister worries me desperately this morning, because he answered my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East by saying that the success of the police would be measured by the crime detection rates. My hon. Friend asks whether, if crime goes up, that means that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
the police are more successful. The Minister is responsible for the fire brigade. We shall be seeing firemen running about all over Scotland starting fires in order to persuade the Minister that they are very successful. The more fires they put out, the more successful they will appear to be.<br><br>
I never heard such a weak argument as that against the detailed proposals that have been put forward this morning. I have never seen anyone reject an olive branch in the way that the Minister rejected it this morning. I have the feeling that we shall return to this matter at a later date, and then no doubt the mute hon. Members, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock), the silent senator the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser)— where is he now?—Mr. Whippy, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), will all be persuading us that it was really their idea to introduce this independent element. You and I, Mr. Gourlay, will sit back and remember Tuesday morning, 20 May, when we failed to convince the Minister on a bunch of statistics which were absolutely meaningless. He says that it has not done any good, but, on the other hand, it has not done any harm. The sum and substance of the Minister's argument is that it has not done any good; on the other hand, it has not done any harm, so do not let us do it at all.<br><br>
What an argument for a Government Minister to put up! There is no consideration at all for the good relations that could be established. This day will go down as the day of shame for the Tory Government as represented by the handful that have been sent from Scotland, and they will be even less in number when we come to the next general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You
wait.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we record the fact that the Government Whip spoke?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not go down as a day of shame. We shall have with us on this occasion the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart). There are six advocates on the Government side of the Committee, and I have supreme confidence that they will see where the side of justice and sense lies. They may yet outvote the Minister, and I think they have good reason to. Quite apart from the rightness
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
of our case, the reply of the Minister sufficiently merits some opposition or abstention from members of his own party.<br><br>
I want to look at the Ministers argument before underlining the basic case. I think the right hon. Member for Western Isles and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) put their finger on the right point, the point we made last week and the point we have to reiterate, that regardless of what statistics may be adduced on this—and we will look at them in a moment—it is right that there should be confidence between the community and the police, and the absence of a public presence in complaints procedure prevents that full confidence occurring. The analogies they gave with other professions was absolutely right.<br><br>
The second point that must be made at the beginning is that this is entirely in the interests of the police themselves. I quoted at length the statements of people like Sir Robert Mark and David McNee, who have been opposing this proposition. I do not think they are doing the police a service. Doctors are protected. When an action is taken against an individual doctor, a disciplinary action of a kind analogous to that against the police, it goes in front of a lay tribunal, and if the doctor is endorsed or if he emerges right, people accept it. This is not the case when it is a secret and private disciplinary matter. It is in the interests of the police themselves.<br><br>
Let us have a look at the arguments put forward by the Minister, which I found strange. He made a comparison between Scotland and England and said that in England more complaints are brought despite the presence of an independent police board than there are proportionately in Scotland. It is true. At a rough calculation it is something like three or four times as many per head. But what a vision of society and behaviour that the fact of a police board or a non-police board of itself should loom so significantly! It wipes out tradition, history, culture and attitudes; police procedures and law are all wiped out when the Minister makes a direct numerical comparison of that kind and relates it only to this minor matter of a police board or not. If we want to find the reasons for differences in behaviour in Scotland, it is our history, our culture, our tradition, and in this field there is a totally different police procedure and a difference of law.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the Minister has used time and time again as an argument for detention clauses the fact that the English already have laws like this? My hon. Friend is coming to that point, because it is very important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is my last point on that list. I was making this as the general view of rejecting such a nonsense as basing that kind of statistic on the presence or non-presence of a police board. The statistics are totally non-valid. It is a fact, but it is no more than a fact. It is not a fact which points to any conclusion. The Minister does not understand what evidence means.<br><br>
If it is a fact that somebody has a Pentel instead of a Biro pen, that may be a fact; it may have nothing whatever to do with proving a forgery. A fact points somewhere before it becomes evidence. This fact, and the crude statistic of comparison, points in no direction. The factors I have mentioned are much more important in relation to Scottish behaviour and English behaviour. Above all, if we want to narrow down the field, there is this specific difference in the police situation, the procedural situation and the behavioural situation between England and Scotland.<br><br>
If there is any comparison with the things that we are about to do in this Bill, it is the word "sus". The word "sus" in England has almost passed into a kind of folk language. Children in the playground playing games will not say "Ye're fun oot", or "Ye're ba's in the slates", as we would say in Glasgow. They say "You're sussed". Kids in the playground use the phrase "You're sussed", meaning "You're conned" or "You're found out". I was speaking a couple of weeks ago to an actor from New Zealand—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue this line of argument too long. Perhaps he could relate his remarks more to the reason why we should have this tribunal without departing from the general aspect of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely, specifically and narrowly dealing with the point I am making. I am specifically and narrowly dealing with the Minister's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interject in the hon. Member's speech, but it seemed to me that he was developing an argument about the legal aspect of "sus".</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, Mr. Gourlay—and I want to protest strongly about this—I am very narrowly and specifically dealing with the statistical argument put forward by the Minister. I am talking now about the situation in England which gave rise to his high figures, which he claimed—I think—was in relation to the establishment or non-establishment of a public police board. I am showing that there are other reasons. I have listed a number of reasons, and I said that one of them was in this police and legal aspect. The point about "sus" is that it leads to a large number of complaints.<br><br>
If we look at the criminal board in England—I am dealing specifically with the Minister's own argument, Mr. Gourlay—we find that in the analysis of all complaints dealt with for 1980—that is, in the 1979 figures—the highest total of kinds of complaint was in relation to irregularity in procedure, closely followed by assault. Complaints about police assault are very common. Both of these are linked closely to "sus". More than one-third—5,000 out of 13,000 complaints—relate to procedure and assault.<br><br>
People in trouble often blame the police, and they are usually wrong—we know that. But a very high percentage relates to the question of police procedures. This background of "sus", in particular in relation to immigrant problems, is one of the reasons for the high percentage. It is not related to the presence or absence of a police board. It is also, I have no doubt, the reason for the large percentage of withdrawals in England, of 45 per cent. It is a terrible waste of a man's intellect to have to deal with these arguments, because they were nonsensical from the beginning.<br><br>
The English figure of 45 per cent. withdrawal is compared with the Scottish figure of 29 per cent. That is very easily explained when one looks at the people—immigrant youngsters and others—against whom action has been taken by the police in relation to "sus" and against whom initial complaints are made, and often, on advice, withdrawn. They are withdrawn on the advice of community and welfare workers who tell the police it will make things more difficult for them in future if they proceed. That is one specific reason why that percentage is higher in England than it is in Scotland.<br><br>
For the Minister to adduce that kind of argument and to pay no attention whatsoever to the separate legalities and pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
cedures and conditions in England is a disgrace. It is a day of shame, however the vote goes—as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said—that that should have been done.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The Minister makes it look as if something else is to be deduced from the presence of a public police board in England, and invalidates the argument for one in Scotland. "Look here," he says, "The figures went up in England from 28,000 to 29,000, with the police board. They went down in Scotland from 1,157 to 942." What does he want from a police board? This is why I made the analogy with the police. Does he rate the efficiency and the Tightness of the presence of a police board? Does he claim that it is working well? Yet crime increases. I should have thought that the point about the Police Complaints Board was neither specifically to increase or to reduce the incidence. It is to give confidence to the community that justice has been seen to be done along with bringing about justice. This is another non-relevant fact, and no evidence.<br><br>
One looks again at the Minister's other statistic, that in England 10.2 per cent. of complaints were substantiated or proceeded with in some way or another, and in Scotland 12.1 per cent. He says that this again invalidates the argument for a complaints board—again a fact and non-evidence. It has no relationship whatsoever to the basic argument and the proposition, because he prefaced that by saying that the only reason we can have for adducing an independent police tribunal is that we think that the complaints will not be carried through, and that because we feel that complaints in the existing form will not be carried through, therefore fewer people will complain. But he points out that a higher percentage has been substantiated in Scotland than in England. That is what he says, that it invalidates our point.<br><br>
Two things must be said on that nonsensical statistic—the fact that non-evidence is adduced. There is no relationship between how people feel that complaints will be carried out or not and the percentage which are substantiated. It is not because we know in Scotland that 12.1 per cent. have been substantiated that we say that it is or it is not worth while making a complaint. It has no relevance whatsoever. It was a phoney speech, a series of statis-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
tics with neither linking nor sense, nor any bearing on the argument. I think that it should be rejected with complete contempt.<br><br>
One or two other things have to be thought about here. We are bringing in legislation which brings us—this point is still relevant—to the "sus" practice in England. We know that this is much larger in England because of the presence of immigrant populations and because of the difficulties that can exist between the police and young blacks one thinks of the situation in Brixton or, indeed, with young people in London in general—something which all good policemen are striving to improve. But it exists, and there are problems on both sides.<br><br>
I think that the Minister's speech was a conflict speech. He saw police versus community throughout all the statistics he adduced. In no sense was the purpose to help to create good confidence and, following good confidence, a good public relationship with the police. We are on the side of law and order. We are on the side of the police, but the Government are against them, and I think that is a pity.<br><br>
We can adduce evidence from a more independent position of the Solicitor-General last year. He said on 30 January 1979 in col. 147:
<br><blockquote><p>"What a person says in a police station … is frequently denied by him. He may say that the policeman wrote it down, that he did not say it, but that he was told that, if he did not sign it, he would be charged with something else. If there is this unfortunate and undesirable questioning of the credibility of the police with regard to written statements, we shall get it all the more under this procedure.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I wish to say nothing more, but I thought it right to point out that this power may lead to the production of incompletent evidence."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 30 January 1979; col. 147.</i>]</p></blockquote>
At that time he was on the side of law and order and understood the problem of detention. We should now know why he has changed his view, if indeed he has changed his view. What he is describing as happening more often is one of the reasons for the higher statistics in England, because the "sus" practice has been simpler than what is now being proposed in this Bill.<br><br>
Let us look at the kind of points for which complaints would be made, keeping in the background that the highest figure for complaints where there was a public board was on police procedure. Let us look at the time factor, at the vagueness in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
relationship that will not exist with a specific power under the Bill, the power of detention, while at the same time running parallel with it are the existing police powers to get voluntary statements.<br><br>
There is a problem here which the Minister has not even fully examined yet in relation to the amendments: the question of the voluntary statement before, the man eventually saying "I want to go", and detention starting at that point; or the continuation in the police station after detention, where the police later claim that they informed him that detention had ceased and he might go. There is a lack of clarity on this. Above all, there will be a lack of clarity in practice. This in itself, as the Solicitor-General for Scotland in a more independent position last year himself recognised, can lead to an increase in complaints.<br><br>
There are other factors in the Bill which would substantiate the reason for an independent public tribunal for police complaints. There is clause 4 and the question of search, which could easily lead to a dangerous breakdown in community relations between youngsters and the police. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth was right when he said that this would justify it in itself.<br><br>
I was called to task for making one or two quotations last week in relation to what I saw as the dangerous background to some of these proposals and which I adduced as further arguments for the presence of a police complaints tribunal. If I may be permitted, I will give one or two other quotations, because this in itself may help to explain the large number of complaints and their eventual withdrawal in England as compared with Scotland.<br><br>
I am talking about a book by David Powys called the "The Signs of Crime", which had a foreword by Robert Mark, who described it as showing the author's fair-mindedness. It is a kind of manual for the police. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Watch for:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Criminals using vehicles who, although not dishonest in the ordinary sense, may, owing to extreme political views, intend to harm the community you have sworn to protect. While there are subtle differences between these types of extremists and thieves, it is difficult to put one's finger on material distinctions. However, they seem to have a motivation or dedication, whatever their appearance (they are usually scruffy and, occasionally, personally dirty), markedly dissimilar to the cynicism of the greedy or dissatisfied thief … You see, political immoderates consider themselves soldiers, rather than 'smart operators' who think
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
the world owes them a living. This will show in their ordinary conversation, where almost unconsciously, they will use the jargon of their beliefs."</p></blockquote>
We often hear that.
<br><blockquote><p>"This intense and extremist gabble, if spoken with a cultured voice, particularly if the speaker is a woman, should make you pause and think through the likelihood that you have stumbled over an important matter."</p></blockquote>
One speaking with an extremist gabble in a cultured voice, particularly if she is a woman, is, as I said last week, not a blue-rinsed extremist at the Conservative Party conference calling for the return of flogging but the kind of youngster who gets involved in demonstrations. Given that factor and this kind of thinking preached at a top level by the police in England and Wales, is it any surprise that incidents will happen and complaints will take place? I am referring still to the Minister's statistics.<br><br>
I have a final quotation. Talking about people who live in communes and so on, a recent history of the Metropolitan Police quotes a Scotland Yard report which says,
<br><blockquote><p>"They are, in the main, persons of considerable intelligence and cunning and have usually had the</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p>The basic argument is that, just as for justice in law and medicine, it is necessary to have a publicly known and independent tribunal which will deal with complaints, so too it is necessary in that which exacts the power of society at its most forceful with the citizens of that society; that is, the police. Just as a doctor gets security by being judged by a lay tribunal of the GMC rather than by the British Medical Association, so in this field too it must be the case that this should be a publicly known and independent body. That way lies security for the police and for the community. Above all, it is not only just but must be seen to be just.<br><br></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a group of inter locking amendments which are quite clear in intention. I hope that it will find at least some sympathetic response. I presume that the Solicitor-General for Scotland, as he sits alone in his glory, or at least his ministerial glory, on the Front Bench on this occasion—</span></p>
<p>12.15pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend goes on, I hope that he will not taunt the Solicitor-General for Scotland. My hon. Friend should be aware that the Solicitor-General has travelled all the way back from the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland this morning specifically to answer my hon. Friend's debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that. It occurs to me that there may be a slightly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
more sinister reason. The Solicitor-General may have been anxious to get away from a body so contaminated with devolution spirit. The Church and Nation Committee report might be too strong medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairburn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having had three days with God, I thought that I would come and have one day with Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suffer from many delusions of grandeur but I have not quite got to that stage. I hope that supernatural powers of persuasion are with me today and that we shall have some success with succeeding amendments. I now address myself solemnly to the business in hand.<br><br>
Clause 3 is interesting not only because it gives to people who have been detained under clause 2 the right to have intimation of their detention and of its place sent
<br><blockquote><p>"to a solicitor and to one other person reasonably named"</p></blockquote>
but because in paragraph (<i>a</i>) it gives certain rights to people who have been arrested. I welcome that.<br><br>
This is one of many clauses which I welcome in general intent, but it does not go far enough. It makes a distinction between those who have been arrested and those who have merely been detained. If one has been arrested, one may have intimation sent to a person. But in the second category intimation may be sent not only to a person but to a solicitor and one other person—presumably a relative. A two-tier situation has been built into the Bill. I cannot understand the need for this distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may shorten the hon. Gentleman's remarks if I remind him that the clause starts by referring to
<br><blockquote><p>"section 19 or 305 of the 1975 Act",</p></blockquote>
which grants the right to an arrested person to have a solicitor informed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. That answers part of the point. Clearly, I should have known that, and that is <i>mea culpa.</i> I should have checked that. But it answers only part of it. I am coming to a more important point which we have already rehearsed in this debate: whether the right of intimation is in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
itself of any great value. I am also interested in the right of access once intimation has been sent.<br><br>
If I have been detained or arrested and am sitting in the police station and say "I should like to intimate where I am to my solicitor, and I should like him to come round", it may be of some consolation for me to know that my professional adviser has arrived at the police station and is sitting out in the front hall. It will be of considerably more use to me if he can come in and advise me as to my rights and how I should conduct myself in a given situation.<br><br>
I see the point of intimation to a member of the family. It may have a second purpose—to stop anxiety. But that cannot apply in the case of a solicitor. Worry and anxiety will start only when he discovers where the pesky man is and not when he does not know. The only point of intimation to a solicitor, which we understand is possible under the 1975 Act and under clause 2 of the Bill, is that a solicitor shall have access to his client at the said police station for the purpose of giving advice. It is just verbiage. It is a right without substance.<br><br>
The important point about the amendments is that they are an attempt to ensure that a solicitor, thus summoned, has a right of access to his client so that advice can be given. The Solicitor-General will see that we propose to leave out lines 22 to 24 and insert the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and any solicitor so informed shall have access to his client at the said police station … for the purpose of giving advice."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman's</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>attention having been called to the fact that five Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and five Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The "day of shame" phrase has been bandied around, but for the Government Whip it really is a day of shame when he has lost the quorum on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. I know that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), whose conscientiousness I have always admired, will take this matter very seriously indeed, and I trust there will be a major inquiry into why his troops have slunk away into the morning mist in this deplorable fashion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
I do not want to overdo the drama and talk about the rage of the people of Scotland, because the people of Scotland may be largely indifferent to the activities of Conservative Back Benchers, but, for all that, those of us who take this as a debate of some substance and this Bill as a matter of some importance will be sorry that we have succeeded in losing a quorum in this way.<br><br>
I return to the amendment. I have made the important point that access is the essence of the safeguard if the safeguard is to mean anything at all. The subsidiary theme is to take out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or, where some delay is necessary in the interest of the investigation or the prevention of crime or the apprehension of offenders, with no more delay than is so necessary."</p></blockquote>
My anxiety there is that it seems to write in a discretion to the police. It may be that we shall have to look again at the wording here. I could understand it if the Solicitor-General did not like my amendment, which merely put in "without delay" as a hard instruction, because there are circumstances in which intimation may be with delay of necessity because the police, with the very best will in the world, cannot carry out the intimation although they try. It might be that to leave it just as "without delay" was too cruel a limitation on the police.<br><br>
However, the amendment seeks to draw attention to the fact that we are building in, as the clause is presently drawn, a specific discretion to delay the attempt to intimate, and that is what I have very grave doubts about. If we look at the words in the Bill, the police have to do it:
<br><blockquote><p>"without delay or, where some delay is necessary in the interest of the investigation or the prevention of crime or the apprehension of offenders".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the implication there is that the police can sit down and say that they have asked for Mr. X to be summoned, or they have intimated to Mr. X, but they are going to use their discretion and they have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to get a solicitor to the man concerned because it would not be in the interests of the investigation.<br><br>
For example, would the interests of the investigation be that if a solicitor came and was allowed to see the client, which might be discretionary if we do not include my amendment, he would obstruct the likelihood of an extra-judicial confession emerging from any questioning that might take place under clause 2?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
Perhaps the Minister can take it away and come back on Report with some form of words to make it clear that it should be without delay or that the delay should only be such as was enforced by necessity—that is, the inability to find the person to whom intimation must be given or circumstances of that kind. However, what I want taken out is the discretion to stop the process of intimation for a period because the police, in their own mind, consider that it is in the interests of the investigation that there be a delay.<br><br>
Those are the two points, and I hope the Solicitor-General has well understood them. Access is a necessary concomitant of intimation, and without the first the second becomes a totally useless safeguard and merely a cosmetic gesture. "Without delay" should be limited only by practicalities and not by intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the purposes of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but I hope that, after explanation, he will understand the reasons for the clause being framed as it presently is. If he looks at section 19 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 he will find an interesting comment on his profession:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where any person has been arrested on any criminal charge, such person shall be entitled immediately upon such arrest to have intimation sent to a solicitor that his professional assistance is required by such person."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) says,
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be in the power of the sheriff or justice to delay such examination for a period not exceeding 48 hours … in order to allow time for the attendance of such solicitor."</p></blockquote>
The detainee, at any rate, were he covered by a similar provision, would have been out for 42 hours by the time his solicitor arrived at the police station.<br><br>
I will deal with the two matters of access and delay in that order. This matter was actually considered by the Thomson committee. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is not here, so it is not profane to read it to the Committee. At page 25, paragraph 5.08, the committee was specifically considering whether the right for a person to have an interview with a solicitor when he has been arrested should apply to a person who has been detained. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"So far in this Chapter we have been dealing with arrestees, but we have also considered the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
rights of persons who will be detained if our proposals…are accepted. We have set out these rights.…In general they are the same as those of the arrestee, but we <i>recommend</i> one important difference—whereas the arrestee will be entitled to an interview with his solicitor in the police station, the detainee's right will be confined to having his solicitor advised that he has been detained. It will be a matter of police discretion whether to allow the detainee an interview with his solicitor. We consider that such a discretion is necessary at the stage of investigation prior to arrest."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that it is no comfort to know that a solicitor is closer to one than he was, in that he is outside—as the hon. Gentleman said, in the hall. Nevertheless, it is clear that there are certain circumstances in which investigation might be frustrated by the presence of a solicitor. The time that a detainee is entitled to be there is only six hours, and the solicitor might say "I need at least six hours to find out the position of my client. Will you please withdraw?" Clearly, one would have to make considerable changes in the six hours, even if it were acceptable that the police would have no discretion. In my opinion, it is quite unacceptable that they should not have a discretion where, in their opinion, that would interfere with their investigation, and at that stage it is an investigation. It may be a very delicate matter in which such interference could play a wrecking, if unintendedly wrecking, part.<br><br>
The second matter is the question of delay. Again, in my opinion, the police must have a discretion to delay the time when the intimation to whomever is made. As the hon. Member for Garscadden will appreciate, the Government amendments which we discussed on clause 2 which applied to this clause required a record to be kept of when the request is made and when the intimation is made. It is essential, because it is well known from procedures in England that intimations are frequently made to co-accused, co-conspirators, as a result of intimation being made. It is likely that anybody who, for instance, has planned anything so sophisticated as a bank robbery will be anxious if he is arrested to let his co-conspirators, his co-robbers, know that the police have begun to sniff the trail. So he will ask for intimation to somebody who knows what to do. In those circumstances that would merely frustrate justice.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
It may be a very serious crime, if we are to take examples from recent history. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
people are sophisticated enough to have drug factories, and one part of them is discovered, intimation to those in another part of the country who are in the same operation is vital for the salvation of the person to whom the intimation is made, who can then leave the country or go into hiding. It also may be vital to remove the link which would provide the evidence against the person already detained.<br><br>
Therefore, I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that there are circumstances in which such intimation would merely lead to the frustration of justice and would not serve the purpose for which it is intended; namely, to allay the anxieties of his family when a person has been detained.<br><br>
I should like to return for a moment to the question of the right to access to a solicitor. No doubt it will interest the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) to remember the exchange last year when the hon. Member for Garscadden said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will my hon. Friend confirm that if a lawyer were informed that his client had been detained under subsection (2), he would be allowed to go to the police station to see him, but that he would not have any rights to be present during any of the questioning that might take place under the terms of subsection (2)?"</p></blockquote>
To which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, absolutely."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979; cols. 212–213.]</p></blockquote>
So the situation has not changed. But I think the hon. Member will accept that the discretion in both ways is necessary in the interests of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy about the situation. I do not like a discretion being written in for a tiny handful of cases, but I accept that there may be circumstances in which it is very difficult to avoid the argument that discretion is in the interests of the general investigation by the police, and I do not want to be difficult about this.<br><br>
As to the quotation from the Committee stage of the previous Bill, I think, to be fair to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), the question was very much in terms of the right of a solicitor to be present during questioning under clause 3(2) of that Bill. Of course I am not at this stage pressing for that. I am asking for access,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
which would not mean the right to stay throughout the period of six hours, when questioning may take place. I am asking merely for an opportunity for the suspected person to be seen and given some advice before the questioning continues, perhaps, if it is well into the six-hour period, or before it starts if the solicitor is quick off the mark and gets there right at the beginning.<br><br>
I am not very happy with the quotations from paragraph 5.08 of the Thomson report. As so often happens with Thomson—I suppose this may be inevitable—it is very much just a statement. There is no hint here of the basis on which the argument was conducted or on what basis the conclusions have been founded. We are merely left with a kind of fiat from on high:
<br><blockquote><p>We consider that such a discretion is necessary at the stage of investigation prior to arrest."</p></blockquote>
I wish we could know a little more about the thought processes of the members of the Thomson committee when they reached this point. However, I accept that presumably they did consider it, and we must have some confidence in what they say.<br><br>
I would mention just one thing. In paragraph 5.08 the Thomson report says, in connection with the rights of a detainee:
<br><blockquote><p>"In general they are the same as those of the arrestee, but we <i>recommend</i> one important difference—whereas the arrestee will be entitled to an interview with his solicitor in the police station, the detainee's right will be confined to having his solicitor advised that he has been detained."</p></blockquote>
The Solicitor-General may want to interrupt me and put me right on the law, and I say that with no false modesty, but it has always been my understanding that when Thomson recommends—as it does—that there should be a right for a solicitor to see his client, once arrested, at the police station, that would be a change in the present law.<br><br>
The Thomson report makes that point in paragraph 3.23:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under the present law an arrested person is entitled to have information of his arrest sent to his solicitor, but his only right to see his solicitor is to see him before his appearance in court."</p></blockquote>
That would presumably be the equivalent of seeing the duty solicitor.<br><br>
So, as I understand the law, although Thomson is recommending that there should be a right for an arrested man to see a solicitor at the police station, that is not being implemented in the present Bill. The Solicitor-General is relying on Thom-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
son to rebutt the suggestion that there should be a right for a detainee to see a solicitor, but his own Bill is not taking up the other Thomson recommendation, the parallel one, which is that there should be a right for the arrestee to see his solicitor at a police station and not merely at the point when he is being produced in court.<br><br>
There is a slight matter here of the Solicitor-General eating his cake and having it, of taking one part of Thomson but not the other. He may want to comment on that. I should have been happier if, relying on Thomson, he had said, "Fair enough. We shall take Thomson's advice and give no right to a detainee. But, of course, as we are relying on Thomson, we will take Thomson's advice and give a right to the arrestee." What is happening here is that he is taking the illiberal line on both occasions, even though in one case it means endorsing Thomson and in the other case it means rejecting Thomson. I am sorry that this inconsistency has appeared. Perhaps he will look at it again with a view to seeing whether he might follow Thomson on both points and bring in a suitable amendment on Report about the right of an arrestee to see his solicitor at the police station.<br><br>
Having made that point, I do not intend to force this to a vote. I shall certainly not persist with my worries, although they are real worries, about the police discretion to delay intimation. I hope that this will be exercised only occasionally, but I accept that there may be a case for leaving it at least nominally there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could explain what I think has happened. I am not sure that I am not putting Thomson right in the law on this as well. What it says in paragraph 5.08 is based on a belief that the arrestee has a right to see a solicitor, but section 305 of the 1975 Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In any proceedings under this Part of this Act the accused, if apprehended, shall immediately on apprehension be entitled, if he so desires, to have intimation sent to a solicitor, and to have a private interview with such solicitor prior to being brought before the court."</p></blockquote>
This means that he must have that right before any proceedings. But it may be that Thomson misinterpreted that as meaning that it must be at the police station. However, clearly it could be anywhere. If the man is arrested in a police station, he will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
either see the person at the police station or he will see him, if it is the duty solicitor, at court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting debate that we have stumbled into. I see that there is some force in what the Solicitor-General has said in terms of the section in the 1975 Act, but it is clear, if one looks at paragraph 3.23 of Thomson, that the whole argument is founded on enother interpretation of that statutory section. Perhaps it is something that we may return to again. At best, there is clearly an ambiguity. The Solicitor-General might well consider whether it is one which he ought to clear up by a simple amendment.<br><br>
My view, in any event, is that Thomson is right on the merits, that there should be a right of access to a solicitor once one has been arrested, and if Thomson has a view that that right is not supported in the present statute, as is argued in paragraphs 3.23 and 5.08, that is something which the Solicitor-General should look at.<br><br>
In any event, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br></span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed,</i> No. 153, in page 4, line 24, at end insert,</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is closely linked in its content with amendment No. 143 in my name. Would it be possible, as you intend to call amendment No. 143,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
then to refer to amendment No. 153? If we pass amendment No. 153 formally now, it will presumably not be possible then to refer to it and make any points as to the differences between that amendment and amendment No. 143.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's observations but amendment No. 153 has already been debated by the Committee and, therefore, I must put the question. Amendment No. 143 will be called subsequently.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 4, line 24, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The person so arrested or detained shall be informed of his rights in relation to this section immediately on his being arrested or detained and the time at which he was so informed shall be recorded.".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment to highlight one or two differences between it and amendment No. 153 which we have just passed. There are two major differences between this amendment and the Government amendment. The first is that in my amendment a person's right to be informed of his rights in terms of intimation to a solicitor or another person should be given to him immediately on arrest or detention, whereas in the Government amendment that we have just passed it clearly states that this information should be given:
<br><blockquote><p>"on arrival at the police station or other premises".</p></blockquote>
There seems to be some duality here between previous Government amendments which put the period of detention forward to the point where the policeman actually stated the words "You are detained", whether in a police station or not, and their amendment No. 153. I think that my amendment makes it clear that as soon as the person is either arrested or detained the police should tell him that he has the right to be informed, that he can contact a solicitor or other person if he so wishes unless in the terms of detention the police have decided that that should not be the case.<br><br>
In view of modern technology, I do not think that many policemen would detain a person without having direct access to a police station by radio communication. Therefore, having informed the person of that right when he is detained, the police-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
man can say, "I am radioing that information through. You are entitled to a solicitor or other person being informed. Which solicitor or other person? I will radio it through." It can, therefore, be that much quicker, right at the beginning of the detention or the period of arrest.<br><br>
The second difference is that amendment No. 153 says in subsection (2) that the time at which that request is made shall be recorded. My amendment is a little different, that the time at which the person was informed shall be recorded. That is adding to the list of the information particularly on detention which we are very keen to see, that at all points there is a recording of the events of the detention and that the time should be one of the other things which should be recorded. So when the person who is detained, or his solicitor, wishes to check that, he will know exactly when it was that he was informed of his right. If there is some discrepancy in the record between that and arrival at a police station or the period at which the detention in theory started, he will obviously have some quibble with the police over that matter. I would certainly wish that information to be recorded.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
There is one other point about amendment No. 153 which I find worrying. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where he is not arrested, or as the case may be detained, until after such arrival, on such arrest or detention."</p></blockquote>
That essentially means that if a person is invited to the police station and goes along of his own free will to be questioned, he shall not have the right to be informed that he may inform a solicitor or another person where he is.<br><br>
I find that worrying for two reasons. First, the man does not have the right to be informed that he can contact a solicitor. He should have that right. Even though he has not been arrested or detained, so what? He is in a police station and his family may well be worried about him, whether or not he has been formally detained or arrested.<br><br>
But what is more worrying is that we thought that we were merely clearing up existing police procedure and that in many ways detention was to replace the invitation to come to the police station. But we now see that it will not be a replacement at all. A person may have already been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
detained for questioning, willingly, by invitation, in a police station for 12 hours. At the end of 12 hours he may say, "I have had enough. I am totally innocent. I have willingly co-operated with you, and I am now going." At that point the police can turn round and say, "We are sorry. We are now detaining you." The man can be there for another six hours.<br><br>
If that is the case—except for one comment made by the Solicitor-General in an earlier debate, this amendment is the first intimation of the fact—it is my intention to table on Report amendments to ensure that that does not happen, and that either detention replaces the invitation or we have no detention at all. We cannot have this continuation of existing procedure plus this new power on top, which is what the amendment suggests.<br><br>
I should like answers from the Government to the three specific points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is entirely impractical. If a recording is made of the information as proposed in amendment No. 153, it is important that it should be done in a police station where there is a central facility for all these facts on all these occasions to be recorded. To have these intimations made and passed over the air—the times at which they were made or whatever—for someone who is not involved in the matter to make the recording, would be entirely impractical.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, we said that we should give instructions that in the ordinary case it would be expected that a person would be taken to the police station as quickly as possible after any detention. Therefore, the intimation to him will arrive at that point, which will mean, in the ordinary case, if he is detained, that the information is sent and that there are six hours for the notified person to arrive. It may be that in the 1975 Act 48 hours is thought to be the time it takes for a solicitor to get to a police station but in this case the solicitor will know that if he is not there within six hours his client will have gone.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of a person who is not detained requiring a solicitor. If he wants a solicitor, he can leave the police station and talk to him personally in his office. That is another
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
matter which does not affect the question of detention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the Solicitor-General's point that the person cannot be informed at the point of arrest or detention. We have heard from the Government side before that a lot of this information will be recorded in the policeman's notebook. So why is it impractical for the time at which the policeman has informed the person detained or arrested of his rights under this to be recorded in his notebook, because it can then be transferred, when he gets back to the police station, into the official central record in the police station itself?<br><br>
The suggestion that it would be some other constable, rather than the person who was detaining who would give the information if it was at the police station I find remarkable. When we tried to write amendments into the Bill to provide that the officer in charge at the police station should be the person who actually allowed the detention to start, it was turned down by the Government on the basis that it would be the constable who would take that decision. Now it is the constable out on the beat or in his Panda car who will be detaining or arresting a person. It will not be some other person who is not involved in the detention; it will be the constable who actually is doing it, and once he says "I am detaining you", he should inform the man of his rights.<br><br>
I have reservations about the Government amendment, in particular about one part of it which I would hope to come back to on Report, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When, at the end of clause 2, I saw the Under-Secretary leave the Committee Room followed by so many of his hon. Friends that the Government Whip nearly had a heart attack out in the Lobby trying to restore the quorum to the Committee, I knew without looking at the report of the previous Government's Bill that it was the Under-Secretary who had then dealt with this clause, because this is the principle that the Government have adopted throughout this whole Bill in order to save the Under-Secretary and the Solicitor-General contradicting themselves.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
As I have explained so often through this Bill, any clause that the Solicitor-General dealt with on the previous Bill is dealt with by the Under-Secretary on this Bill, and any clause that the Under-Secretary dealt with on the previous Bill is dealt with by the Solicitor-General on this Bill. So I knew without looking at the report of the proceedings of our last consideration of the Bill that the Under-Secretary, from his Opposition seat in the previous Committee, had dealt with the corresponding clause in the Labour Government's Bill.<br><br>
One or two things were said by the Under-Secretary then that he did not want to answer for this morning, so the buck was passed to the Solicitor-General. In order to save their advisers working out the rotation of duties, I should tell the Under-Secretary that it is his turn to deal with the stop and search powers for offensive weapons and it is also his turn to deal with the drunken offenders clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then we are altering the duty rota, because it was the Solicitor-General who dealt with the drunken offenders clause in the previous Government's Bill. I just assumed that the duty rota would continue. I was trying, helpful as I always am, to save the advisers looking out the duty rota and mapping it out for one or two weeks ahead. I am sure that I have been helpful.<br><br>
One of the issues that arose on clause 3 the last time we discussed this matter was the use of the word "reasonably". I was surprised because whole clause is surrounded by a person "reasonably named" by the person who has been detained. The person detained has two rights—first, to name a solicitor who shall be advised and, secondly, to name someone else who has been "reasonably named". I am wondering why it has been included in clause 3 this time. The Solicitor-General, and particularly the Under-Secretary, will remember that during the previous Government's Bill the then Opposition, now the Government, tabled an amendment to delete the word "reasonably", and there were some very persuasive arguments put by the present Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). It was only at the very last minute that we got what could best be described as a grudging withdrawal when he said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"However, I do not suggest that it is a major point of principle."</p></blockquote>
This is the deletion of the word "reasonably".<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Government wish to be churlish in this unfortunate way, who am I to suggest otherwise?"</p></blockquote>
He then asked the leave of the Committee to withdraw.<br><br>
I gathered from that that the hon. Gentleman's pique that was shown in the remarkable withdrawal of the amendment illustrated that he nevertheless considered the matter important. That was backed up by some interesting examples.<br><br>
The present Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I can understand the Minister's"—</p></blockquote>
as I was then—
<br><blockquote><p>"explanation, but I should have thought that the police were putting themselves in a potentially invidious position if they were to be judge and jury as to whether the person was reasonably named."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean now that the Government have decided to put the police in an invidious position of being the judge and jury of whether a person is a person reasonably named? I should have thought that that kind of argument would have led the present Government to delete the word "reasonably".<br><br>
The present Minister then went on to give us a very good example:
<br><blockquote><p>"Of course, the Minister is right that someone might mention a pop star or other famous individual, but who is to say for certain that that is not an acquaintance of the person detained in the police station? My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Churchill) regularly has difficulties when he is requested for his name and says 'Winston Churchill'…. Not necessarily when he is arrested, but on any occasion. Obviously, a police officer or any other person to whom that name was given would be unlikely to accept it at face value as being the true name."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979, cols. 214–215.]</p></blockquote>
I must admit that at that time I was partly persuaded that there was some difficulty about this sort of thing.<br><br>
I am anxious to hear the Solicitor-General explain as reasonably as he can why the word "reasonably", which seemed so important to his junior colleague in the last Bill, is now deemed necessary to be included in this Bill, and why, if the arguments which were pursued by his junior colleague in the last Bill—that is, putting the police in an invidious position of being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
judge and jury—now seem to be less important, and those of us on this side of the Committee who have spent all their time protecting the police from these attacks being launched on them now hear the Solicitor-General exposing them to being described in this invidious way, of being judge and jury and deciding what is reasonable and what is not in terms of whether a person is reasonably named. No doubt the Solicitor-General will give us a reasonable reply to these points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give the hon. Member a reasonable reply to those points. If his arguments had been reasonable instead of unreasonable he would have had ho difficulty in finding one of a clutch of unreasonable people behind him to put down such an amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It is a reasonable point of order to make that, in view of the fact that we are just about to begin a debate on probably the most important clause of the Bill, and one which is very controversial and will attract the attention of a great many people, not only in Scotland—we all know that—</span></p>
