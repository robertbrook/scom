I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on his elevation to the Opposition Front Bench for the remainder of these proceedings. We are, of course, sorry that it has taken

to the very last day of our proceedings for him to move slightly forward in the Committee, but we nevertheless welcome him in that' position and hope that he will continue to carry out his responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seems to amend section 409(1) of the 1975 Act in order to provide that, where a person imprisoned in default of payment of a fine pays part of his fine, the reduction in his sentence shall be calculated by reference to the proportion which the part payment bears to the amount of the fine outstanding rather than the total amount of the fine.

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has always been in the civil law of Scotland the right to take by commission and diligence the evidence of witnesses who could not be present. There has never been such a right in any criminal courts in solemn or other proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 11 introduces the right of either the prosecution or the defence to take the evidence of a witness who is abroad by letter of request before a commissioner who will be judicially sworn. There is an absolute safeguard, as either side can apply for such a request, and either side can object to such a request if there is the slightest suggestion that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1483</span>
evidence will be controversial and cannot properly be taken and cross-examined by this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in recent years there has been an increasing number of witnesses who had to give formal evidence at a time when they were on holiday with their families, particularly police officers and forensic experts, and had to return to the United Kingdom—sometimes having to abandon their holiday—to give formal evidence which was unchallenged, in order to meet the requirements of the law of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was recommended by the Thomson committee that we should have that procedure. It seems to me to do nothing to interfere in any way with the standards of evidence but may in many cases go a long way towards reducing the resentment which appearance in court, and certainly the inconvenience, is imposed upon those who serve the public in one capacity or another. The matter is restricted to the High Court and the sheriff court. It will not be available in the district court and it may not frequently be used, but it seems to be a useful reform and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say first to the Under-Secretary of State that it is very nice that the Conservatives have such a precious sense of protocol. They read all sorts of things into casual seating arrangements, and though I am touched by his interest in my welfare, I assure him that he is being over-solicitous on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, clause 11 seems to be reasonably sensible, but perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland could say whether the arrangements for taking evidence on commission would be exactly the same as they are in terms of civil proceedings. Does that involve, for example, if it is in the High Court, an advocate being despatched to take it, or is it some sort of arrangement where it can either be done in writing or at the locus where the witness is presently by some local man of law, solicitor or otherwise? That would seem sensible to me. We do not want too many people setting off for North America, or wherever it may be, on commission in order to obtain the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I agree that there is in subsection (2) a proposal that application can be opposed, the test is one of fairness which the judge applies. There is no absolute ban if, for example, the prosecu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1484</span>
tion makes the application and the defence says "No, we want the man to be here, as we wish to cross-examine him."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage it is up to the judge to decide. The difficulty is that in order to decide he will have to hear from the defence solicitor, who may be objecting, or the defence counsel, exactly why he needs to cross-examine him. In other words, there would have to be some details revealed of the line of cross-examination and what is the point at issue. That might—I am sure that the Solicitor-General can see my point—make for some difficulties. Would it not have been better if the motion had had to be unanimous. In other words, there would have to be agreement from the other side if it were raised either by the prosecution or the defence, and a cry of "No"—an objection —would rule it out as a possibility, because, if we are to start an argument about cause shown, there might be difficulties over the line to be taken at the trial being reviewed at this preliminary and early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I assure him that while my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State is only interested in his welfare, I am more interested in his advancement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has made two valid points. First, I must explain that there are countries that object to commissions occurring within their territory. I have had experience of going abroad to take evidence, and it is difficult. It has therefore been decided that the letter of request procedure should be addressed to the foreign court in whose jurisdiction the witness is, requesting that the evidence be taken before the court. It would be competent for parties to be represented in the court. This would be instead of a commission going to Germany with a commissioner appointed on the basis of largesse or goodwill—or however they are appointed—and trying to find a cafe in a side street of Munich in which to examine before some appointed advocate a witness whom one has no right to summon to give evidence at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pretty seedy procedure, and the procedure that has been arrived at for dealing with foreign persons is better. Where the witness is in the United Kingdom, the evidence will be taken on commission,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1485</span>
as at present. The court will usually appoint a sheriff as commissioner, or a justice of the peace or a practising solicitor or barrister in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I can see that one might say that, if one side objects, the matter could only therefore be denned as unfair if one objected and was overruled. I think it likely that that will be the interpretation—that one side objects. I can see that one would not wish to reveal why one was objecting. One could say firmly that it would be unfair to have to reveal one's line of cross-examination in order to justify one's argument that it was unfair. One would, in effect, be saying that it was unfair, and that it would be even more unfair if one had to tell the other side why it was unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look sympathetically at the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that if one side says "No" that should mean "No", because there is a certain validity in that argument. If the hon. Gentleman will accept that undertaking, I shall consider whether that would be a preferable procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to do so, Mr. Gourlay. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for his remarks. His arrangements will cut to a minimum the strange and mysterious way in which commissioners are appointed and sent off on safari to obtain evidence in far off and romantic places. The provisions to limit that practice seem to be entirely sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also glad that the hon. and learned Member is prepared to look at my point about opposition being final. The arguments that he was using in the last few minutes were attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say, in introducing the clause, that there may well be individuals who hold views completely contrary to those which I shall express. Let me say at the beginning that I respect their views. I trust that they will also respect mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that some hon. Members may doubt my motives in tabling the new clause. They may wonder why anyone should move such a clause in this Bill. Some of them may lash me verbally, both here in Committee and in the media, indeed, as I recollect, that has already been done. In my judgment, the spoken and written word can often be as painful as—sometimes more painful and often more wounding than—corpora! punishment. I hope sincerely that the Committee will take the clause most seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote the Lord Advocate in the last Parliament. He said:
	<br><q><p>"There are three main ways in which to tackle crime: long-term prevention, principally through education and by involving parents and the community in fostering socially responsible attitudes among young people; short-term prevention, through improving police efficiency and morale and encouraging a preventive role; and third, by ensuring that the criminal justice system is geared to deal fairly and effectively with those who are charged with crimes."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 14 December 1978; cc.2–3.]</p></q>
It is the third way that the new clause attempts to embrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have long held the view that corporal punishment would be an effective deterrent, and with crime as it exists today in Scotland we have a duty to examine all the possible options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In chapter 2 of "Crime and the Prevention of Crime", on page 3, paragraph 4, it is stated that
	<br><q><p>"The present level is about one crime or offence per annum for every 10 persons in Scotland, which represents an increase of between two and three times that recorded 20 years ago."</p></q>
It is because of that that I am moving the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most moved yesterday when lwas canvassing in Glasgow, Central talking to many of the inhabitants and hearing their views and concern about the serious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1487</span>
nature of crime in that area. They were terribly concerned—so much so that on some doors I saw three Yale locks and two hasps and staples. That certainly reflects the growing concern in that area. We ignore it at our peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in some cases—and only in some cases—corporal punishment would be a more reformative measure than imprisonment. There can, surely, be little doubt that for some individuals imprisonment is not an effective reformative measure. Imprisonment involves the loss of a job and meeting and living with people who have lived a life of crime, bringing a risk to the man with a steady job who has committed a crime of violence for the first time because he loses his job and is contaminated by the other prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind individuals who go to a football match or a disco and become involved in an act of violence in which they did not intend to become involved. It is because of that that I believe we ought to give serious consideration to the way in which we deal with such an individual. I suggest that for some people imprisonment is not a good reformative exercise. I believe that corporal punishment could be just the right kind of punishment to stop an offender when he first goes off the rails.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he intends to produce some sort of clear-cut evidence?

The hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) said in the last Parliament that when the individual first goes off the rails we must stop him in his tracks with no lasting damage to his way of life. He will have a painful rear end as a result of corporal punishment. But I sincerely believe that this could be a reformative exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that corporal punishment was abolished in 1948 and there is a widely held belief that before 1948 corporal punishment was used for a wide range of offences. That is not true. The use of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1488</span>
corporal punishment before 1948 was fairly limited. The full details can be found in the report of the advisory committee on the treatment of offenders, chaired by Mr. Justice Barry and appointed by Lord Butler in 1960 to consider corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the Barry committee and the Cadogan report in 1938 recommended that corporal punishment should not be reintroduced. I am reminded also that in an earlier debate on clause 44 I said that there were no simple easy answers and no soft options. I still believe that. I also remind the Committee that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—I am sorry that he is not here this morning—said:
	<br><q><p>"The court is undoubtedly the only and best body to consider the evidence and pass the sentence."</p></q>
That is why I want to give the courts this option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the same debate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr.Hogg) said:
	<br><q><p>"We need a new approach to juvenile crime. We should take account of the fact that young people between the ages of 16 and 21 are a special category … in regard to crime because that age group has a high rate of offence, and of both conviction and re-conviction."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 June 1980; cc 1193–4.]</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted the hon. Member accurately. Whether or not he concludes that I have taken the quotation out of context, I hope that he will listen to the whole of my argument before he interrupts. He may well find that no hon. Members necessarily support my point of view. I am drawing attention to the fact that there was a recognition that this particular age group was a special one. I am glad about that intervention. I have spent most of my adult life working with that age group. I think I can claim to have first-hand knowledge of the problems in some of the worst cities in this country in working for those in that age group and trying to prevent them from going further off the rails.

As I said, I do not doubt the integrity and the manner in which Opposition Members approach this problem. I trust that they will not doubt my integrity. My record in this sphere is something of which I am not the least bit ashamed. I have helped to prevent a lot of young men going off the rails, and have stopped some who were already off the rails from going further off the rails.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to hear that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman got them back to the proper rails without using birching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that. 1 have never said that birching is the only answer. From the outset I have said that this is an option. I want that to be understood. If I had thought that this was a simplistic answer I would have said so. It is not. It is not a simple problem. It is a difficult one. That is why I am drawing attention to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to suggest that, in isolation, this is an answer to anything. I hope that no hon. Member would ever presume that. Of course, it is not. It could be an answer to specific cases in specific situations. That is my only comment on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote the words of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). He said:
	<br><q><p>"The Solicitor-General for Scotland has constantly said that he wants to go forward in the right way, that this is the right way forward for the individual offender."</p></q>
That is the point I am making.
	<br><q><p>"But, of course, he is providing only one way forward for the individual offender, short of a drastic increase in sentence."</p></q>
I am only suggesting that this is an option.
	<br><q><p>"If one is to avoid the detention centre, one has either to decide against a custodial sentence or else, perhaps, artificially lengthen what was in the mind of the judge, which cannot be a good thing."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 June 1980; c.1230.]</p></q>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that they were touching on the area that has caused me concern. I do not in any way disagree with the comments made by the hon. Gentlemen, nor do I doubt that they said these things and meant them. I trust that they will accept what I say and that I mean it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that during those debates hon. Members were not making a case for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1490</span>
kind of sentence proposed in the clause. I believe hon. Members were saying that there should be more flexibility and a wider range of sentences available to the courts. I seriously suggest that the clause gives the courts another option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that most of those who submitted evidence to the Barry committee were in favour of the reintroduction of corporal punishment. For example, it is set out in detail in the report that the Lord Chief Justice had consulted the judges and that the majority of them were in favour of corporal punishment in certain circumstances. In a poll of its members the Magistrates' Association found 4,400 in favour and 1,800 against corporal punishment. The report also recorded that prison governors were about equally divided on the matter. Probation officers were against the reintroduction of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the majority of evidence, including the overwhelming volume of public opinion expressed to the committee, was in favour of corporal punishment. I remind the Committee that the Barry committee said that it thought it right to say that the statistical evidence was of limited value. The committee said that only limited studies could be carried out, because corporal punishment was used only in a small number of cases and in limited circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is recorded that in one small comparative study there appeared to be no great difference in the record before and after between those who had been birched and those who had not, for similar offences. The report points out that this is not a fair comparison because those sentenced to birching would probably be criminals convicted of the more serious or more heinous offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a point to the hon. Gentleman in order to get the record straight? The hon. Gentleman will remember that a cross-section of 3,000 cases were examined by the Barry committee. The committee's view was that the subsequent records of those flogged were slightly worse. In summing up, in paragraph 51 of the report, the committee said that they agreed with the Cadogan committee that judicial corporal punishment had no special or unique influence as a deterrent, and for that reason, the committee thought that it was unlikely to affect the incidence of crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1491</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way endeavouring to use the report of the Barry committee to support my clause. I am endeavouring to show that the evidence provided to that committee was not sufficient to make a substantive judgment one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Barry committee made their recommendations when circumstances were very different from those today. Now, crime is rising and serious crime has risen dramatically over many years. This was evidenced by the comments made in the by-election in Glasgow Central yesterday. There has been an increase in mugging and senseless violence. It is no longer safe to attend football matches or, in some areas, to go out after sunset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the case for the reintroduction of corporal punishment? First, there is clear evidence that existing penalties and deterrents have not succeeded in containing crime. That is factual evidence. In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic rise in all kinds of crime. In particular, crimes of violence and murder have risen by frightening proportions. I believe that if deterrents were introduced—in particular deterrents which would be feared by potential criminals—the present crime figures could change for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I believe that a wider discretion in dealing with offences would assist the courts. I draw the Committee's attention to the annual report of the Chief Constable of the Isle of Man for 1979. Table B on page 13 shows that violence against the person rose by 22 per cent., assaults by the police rose dramatically, and assaults occasioning actual bodily harm rose about 70 per cent. We cannot and should not ignore this evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the Isle of Man has the deterrent of birching and yet it still has these increases in crime? What evidence will the hon. Gentleman produce from those figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The year 1979 was the first full year when the Chief Constable reported that no cases of corporal punishment took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disturbed that the decision of the European Court of Human Rights on birching in the Isle of Man has been instrumental in deterring the Isle of Man
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1492</span>
courts from awarding sentences of corporal punishment. It could and may be argued that this decision could be given as a reason why the Committee should not accept the clause. I remind the Committee that the court's decision was made under section 1 of the convention, which is designed to prevent individuals from torture, slavery, forced labour and religious persecution. It seems incredible that the court should have taken this astonishing interpretation of words which come in the middle of a section dealing with torture and made such a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the drafters of the convention would go to the trouble of writing into the convention on the matter of capital punishment, a sentence which specifically prevents the courts from dealing with the issue of capital punishment provided by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the judgment has done little to enhance the credibility of the court. I feel very sad about that, because I believe that its credibility is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Opposition Members use the decision of the court to oppose the clause, I remind them that other matters have now been referred to the court and it may not be too clever to quote this court and this decision as an aid to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from the discussions that I have had with criminals presently dwelling in my constituency—before anyone comments, they are in Perth prison—that many of them take the view that the penalty of corporal punishment could have had a deterrent effect and may have prevented some individuals from becoming involved in a life of crime. That view is held by a substantial number in that prison. I attend sessions there where we have discussions and debating groups. I find them most illuminating and enlightening, particularly when talking to lifers, who have plenty of time to think. One thing that I found staggering in my ignorance when I first went there was how well read and knowledgeable they were and how they could speak with authority on certain subjects. Certainly, the view on corporal punishment was unanimous. I found that most interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must accept that there is not much evidence to support or oppose my view. The Barry committee conducted only three interviews with individuals who had been birched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it not be suggested
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1493</span>
that they spoke with authority because they practised what they preached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely draw the Committee's attention to my findings. The Committee can make its own judgments on them. I found what those criminals said most illuminating, because I have not had a life where I have associated with people of that kind. I found it interesting to meet them on a number of occasions and discuss with them matters of concern. They were certainly more knowledgeable on these matters than I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not much evidence to support or oppose my view. The Barry committee conducted only three interviews with individuals who had been birched. Two said that it had helped them not to commit any further crimes, and the other said that it made him feel very bitter—hardly sufficient evidence on which to build an informed view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I submit that the Isle of Man evidence, such as it is, makes clear that, when corporal punishment was used as a sentence, it did seem to deter. Before I am accused of pandering to populist views, let me assure the Committee that I have arrived at my view after deep thought and many years of working with young people in various parts of the country. I recognise and respect the views of hon. Members who take a different view from myself. However, I trust that they will also respect my views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my career, I have visited and worked in some countries, outside the United Kingdom, whose regimes were oppressive and some of which were police States. That is why I believe that it would be wrong to suggest that to give the courts in the United Kingdom, and in Scotland in particular, the option of corporal punishment by accepting the clause, would in any way be making Scotland an oppressive or barbaric country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is evidence to convince reasonable people that strong deterrents curb crime. I cite, for example, Lord Carment and the way he dealt with the razor slashers. I also cite—coming nearer home—Sheriff Prain of Perth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not keep perpetuating this nonsensical populist myth about Lord Carment's sentencing. Indeed, sentences have increased since Lord Carment and are rather
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1494</span>
longer now than those he would have applied. Incidentally, by the hon. Gentleman's own figures, crime continued to rise afterwards. It is a complete Golden Age myth. I will not say that it is unlike the rest of his argument, but I think that it is unworthy of the Committee to perpetuate the idea. It is just nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has just made my case for me, because Lord Carment was dealing with the situation as it existed then. I am talking about the situation that exists today. It is my strong belief that we must change to meet changing times. I do not accept, necessarily, that one can use one period of time as an example for another. I am citing Sheriff Prain of Perth. That is my constituency and I deliberately chose my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increase in the number of murders since the abolition of capital punishment. That cannot be disputed. It may be argued that it would be wrong for the State to become involved in inflicting violence in answer to violence. I suggest that the majority of people in Scotland find it—certainly, I find it—far more offensive that the violence inflicted on law-abiding citizens produces less concern in some quarters than the inflicting of violence on criminals who have themselves been found guilty of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those who claim to be morally appalled by corporal punishment will be equally appalled by violence inflicted on innocent law-abiding citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who oppose this clause may argue that, as a result of legislative procedures, there could be a delay of months before the penalty was inflicted. I do not accept that this reduces the effect of the deterrent value of the sentence. Indeed, I would claim that the opposite is the case. The deterrent value could be increased by a delay between the crime taking place and the punishment being inflicted, giving plenty of time to think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the argument that to accept the clause will be a step backwards—that somehow we must always be moving forward, even if we cannot agree where we should be moving. Indeed, few of us can agree just how we should be moving. It is argued that the intellectual and intelligent way to act and behave is to move forwards, yet often in life we know that the intelligent answer, when we have lost our way, are unsure of where we are or cannot agree on the route to take, is to move back to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1495</span>
position occupied previously, which is a known position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that when one is navigating in the air one always tries to return to the position in which one knew where one was. That is something that I learnt at a very early age and have always used when in doubt. Therefore, I do not accept the view that to move forward is necessarily progress. One could be moving farther away from that which is sensible or rational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I claim that the majority of people in Scotland believe that we have to some extent lost our way with regard to crime in Scotland. Many of them are concerned for their own safety and the safety of their friends and relatives. Some would argue that as regards crime we have already moved backwards. The extent of violence which exists at football grounds, on trains, on buses and in the streets is causing great distress and anxiety. In the view of many Scots we have already moved backwards. Therefore, to accept the clause would not necessarily be a step backwards, because we have already moved back. In my view, it would be a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the previous Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), quoted from the Barry committee report. He said:
	<br><q><p>"The subsequent studies have produced similar results to those of the study made by the Cadogan Committee and have confirmed that Committee's conclusion that there was little difference between the subsequent records of men who were flogged and those who were not flogged … in fact, the subsequent records of those flogged were slightly worse."</p></q>
That is exactly what the hon. Gentleman quoted earlier, but I assure him that I had already taken note of that point. The hon. Member for Garscadden also said:
	<br><q><p>"In fairness to the hon. Member for Cathcart"—</p></q>
now the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor)—
	<br><q><p>"he quoted that sentence. He also made the fair proviso that it might be that the subsequent records of those flogged were explicable by the fact that they had worse records at the time the court considered their case, and that was why they were flogged. I hasten to concede that that is a distortion that may explain it."</p></q>
I also acknowledge that the hon. Member for Garscadden said in the same debate:
	<br><q><p>"When birching ended there was a remarkably lengthy period when the commission of these crimes was at a lower level."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1496</span>
I do not wish to make an issue of this point. I hope Labour Members will have realised that. I do not dispute—indeed I accept—that the view of the hon. Member for Garscadden was made clear at that time. He said:
	<br><q><p>"it is clear that there is no evidence at all that either in deterrence of an individual who is birched or as a general warning to the public not to commit these offences, corporal punishment is a deterrent." —[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1979; cc.697–9.]</p></q>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then we have had the 1979 report of the chief constable of the Isle of Man. I sincerely believe that the figures given in that report are clear evidence that the situation in the Isle of Man has deteriorated and that, in the absence of the prospect of receiving corporal punishment, crimes of violence have increased in a substantial and disturbing way. This evidence cannot and should not be glibly pushed aside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want it to be glibly pushed aside either. What has been the pattern of violent crime in the past few years in the Isle of Man? Clearly to take one year and put the stress on it that the hon. Gentleman does can be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My recollection of the reports of the Isle of Man's chief constable — which I admit I looked at only for the previous Committee stage — was that there had been a steady increase in violent crime in the Isle of Man throughout recent years, birching or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the reports, but I do not have them to hand and I would not wish to mislead the Committee. My recollection is that in essence what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has said is correct: they increased, but not to the percentage that they have increased since corporal punishment ceased. Violent crime is increasing throughout Western Europe, but it has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have to consider the view of the public. Public opinion is important, because it can and does influence attitudes. Throughout our debates on the Bill we have heard many speeches about public co-operation, police-public relations and our concern in the matter of public attitudes. If we really meant what we said, should we not acknowledge that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

I leave him to work that one out for himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we genuinely believe that public behaviour is influenced by public views and public attitudes, the only honest course open to the Committee is to support the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) — I am sorry that he is missing this morning — that at our sitting on Thursday 19 June I specifically asked him whether he believed that behaviour could be changed by public views and attitudes. As I understood his reply, he concurred that it could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no ayatollah. I refute that charge. I repeat that I have spent all my adult life working with youths. I have been active in youth organisations and still am today. I have tried in my way to prevent young people going further off the rails when they have gone off them for the first time. For all the reasons that I have given, I believe that hon. Members should give their support to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the Committee can say that I have in any way lobbied him or attempted to get any support on this matter. This is a matter of individual conscience, and we stand and live by our consciences. Those of us who wish to face people honestly will do what we believe is honest and right, and I shall not criticise those who hold views differing from mine. I trust that they will accept that I have arrived at my views in a genuine and honest endeavour to deal with a problem that concerns myself and many others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly take your remarks to heart, Mr. Gourlay. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is entitled to ask that people respect his good faith on this issue—I certainly do—but, on the other hand, he should not say that the only honest course of action is to support his new clause, for I have no intention of supporting it. I think that in this debate we have an absent friend—a ghost that is now at Southend, East—who perhaps was the fons et origo of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to police attitudes towards this matter. I should have liked to hear some evidence, because the views of police officers with whom I have discussed this matter in the past was decidedly mixed and I would say that a majority was against the reintroduction of corporal punishment. One superintendent, whom I knew well and who certainly could not be regarded as a soft man on the punishment of criminals, was totally opposed to it. He said "In all my experience, I never saw anyone to whom birching had been administered change his ways. Those who were going in for a life of crime went on anyway and those who had been overawed, as it were, by the court proceedings learned their lesson and led reasonable lives thereafter."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Isle of Man, in practical terms, birching has gone for good. If anyone here is on the Isle of Man group, as I am, he will have been told by a very high official from the Isle of Man that last year, after the decision of the Court on Human Rights, birching was in effect finished for all time because, if any judge or magistrate ordered that punishment, an appeal would follow which would be honoured by the Isle of Man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to birching. I think that it would be degrading to go back to something that was abolished over 30 years ago. I have no faith in its utility anyway, apart from any moral considerations, and I shall vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this issue I may appear to adopt what is essentially an inconsistent attitude. On the issue of corporal punishment in schools, I do not adopt the view that in no circumstances whatsoever should teachers be empowered to use a modest degree of physical force in asserting discipline. However, I am most firmly opposed to corporal punishment in any form being introduced in our courts as a judicial measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a neighbour of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and it is only fair to record that, as he said, at no point since the Bill was introduced has he ever sought to persuade me to change my mind on this nor, so far as I know, has he sought to persuade any of my right hon. and hon. Friends to change their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am firmly opposed to corporal punishment as a matter of conscience, and when I contemplate some of the correspondence that I received when I voted against capital punishment perhaps I have something to learn. It might have been much easier to have sat mum and kept my views to myself on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of important and difficult arguments are raised and debated in relation to this matter and which arouse a great deal of public concern. I shall seek to address myself to only two matters that I think should be considered at this stage, notwithstanding that it has already been exhaustively considered by the Barry Committee, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the experience of the Isle of Man. It seems to me that if one looks to that island there is nothing to prove what are sometimes the much-vaunted claims of the value of birching. I understand, from the figures of birching in the Isle of Man that 75 per cent, of those birched will eventually be reconvicted. If that is so, there can be nothing significant or unique about that form of punishment in ensuring that people, having made one error in breach of the law, are checked and put back on to the right road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire is misleading the Committee, but there is another figure that should be weighed in the balance in order to put the complete picture before the Committee. As I understand it, in 1977, during which the European Court determined that birching was unlawful, offences of malicious damage to property increased by 58 per cent. By any token that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1500</span>
is a very considerable increase in one area of criminal activity. I believe that the more general argument advanced for corporal punishment is particularly directed at catching youngsters who are prone to that type of behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately stuck to crimes of violence and I trust that my hon. Friend will acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do, but my point is that the efficacy of birching is often sought to be established by reference to what happens on the Isle of Man. All I point to is that in one particular area, which is a type of area in which birching, if it were to be effective, might be demonstrated, and where it was used, one can see from the figures that there has been a 58 per cent, increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member accept, in response to his hon. Friend's question, that about 80 per cent, of cases in the Isle of Man in which birching has taken place, were not for crimes of violence, but for petty larceny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire specifically requires that the change should involve a crime of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I were not persuaded as a matter of conscience to vote against the clause, the other aspect that would cause me to hesitate carefully before I voted for it would be the vital impact of the decision of the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would require Her Majesty's Government to implement a provision which is contrary to our international treaty obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a political argument and a correct assessment that we should withdraw from the Convention on Human Rights, but if that is the right approach we should do so as a separate matter. I should have thought that undesirable. We know what would happen if we accepted the clause. On the first conviction, an appeal would be taken all the way through to the European court. A year, perhaps two years, would pass, and a decision would be reached—if the court followed the precedent that it has already set—that such punishment was unlawful.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1501</span>
In those circumstances, if we inserted the clause into the Bill, we should be introducing a provision into statute, which, given our international treaty obligations, we would be incapable of fulfilling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) was certainly right to raise this subject in debate. There is no doubt that the point of view that he has put forward today is shared by a substantial proportion of the public. It is right that a Bill dealing with criminal justice in Scotland should include an opportunity to debate the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is traditionally the case on a matter of this kind, there will on the Government side of the Committee—and, I am reasonably certain, on the Opposition side also—be a free vote on the matter. I know that my hon. Friend will feel that, on this issue above all others, it would be inappropriate for the Whip to be applied at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of my hon. Friend's speech dealt with the charge often made that corporal punishment involves barbaric punishment, torture or something utterly inhuman and unacceptable. Speaking personally, I have often found it difficult to understand why to confine someone in a prison cell for 20 or 25 years is acceptable in our society as a necessary and unfortunate form of punishment, but that to birch him and get it over quickly is somehow barbaric. I find that argument difficult to accept, although I know that many people hold it strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from issues of principle, we are dealing here with questions of effectiveness. The last time that this matter was discussed in Committee, I mentioned that the statistics do not prove anything either way. It is possible to argue a case either for or against corporal punishment with great ease, depending on the statistics that one selects, but I doubt whether that would convince anyone to adopt a position contrary to that which he previously held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that it can be assumed that there are some individuals who, if corporal punishment were applied to them, would find it an effective deterrent and would not return to a course of criminal activity. However, the court would always find difficulty in assessing in advance which persons might benefit from it and which might be more likely to return to a course
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1502</span>
of crime because of their reaction to the infliction of corporal punishment. I am aware of no way in which one could say with certainty in advance which individual, or which particular crime, would be appropriate for the imposition of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had, on a previous occasion, an exhaustive debate on the merits of corporal punishment, and a number of the issues have been raised again today. The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) were right to draw attention, with considerable emphasis, to the decision of the European Court on Human Rights about the interpretation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire referred to that judgment and to article 1 of the convention. However, the case that was brought before the court was concerned with the interpretation of article 3 of the convention. Article 3 provides that:
	<br><q><p>"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'.</p></q>
My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that, despite the final decision of the European court, it said in its judgment that it had come to the view that it would be improper and incorrect to suggest that corporal punishment amounted to torture. The court ruled out that argument as proved or as a matter that it considered acceptable. Equally, the court concluded that corporal punishment should not be considered an inhuman treatment or punishment. It was prepared to emphasise that that was not its view, and it did not support the appellant in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, article 3 refers to a third category of punishment, neither torture nor inhuman treatment. It refers to "degrading treatment or punishment". When deciding whether corporal punishment should be considered a degrading treatment or punishment the court—by a majority, with only the United Kingdom judge dissenting—took the view that this constituted a breach of article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the convention.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1503</span>
Whatever one's views of the appropriateness of the ruling—I said that the United Kingdom judge took a different view—it is nevertheless a ruling made by the European Court, and I must accordingly tell my hon. Friend that the Government could not consider recommending to the Committee a new clause which has been shown to be a breach of the European convention. Apart from the point of principle involved, there would be the practical consequences to which hon. Gentlemen have already referred—that any attempt by the court to exercise such powers would lead to appeal which would ultimately have to take into account the judgment of the European court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each individual has his view on the principle of this matter, and must come to his decision. But the Government do not support my hon. Friend's new clause, and for the reasons that I have given, I cannot recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) put forward this new clause perfectly honourably. I hope that he will accept that our opposition to it is at least as honourable. He has made great play of the Isle of Man 1979 statistics and of the report of the chief constable for the Isle of Man showing figures of the massive increase which occurred because—in his view—the birch had not been used and therefore was no longer a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that an astonishing view. Despite what the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) says, the birch is still on the statute book in the Isle of Man. The deterrent therefore—in theory—still exists. If he argues that because a deterrent is never used it loses its effectiveness, I hope that the hon. right Member will speak on the next debate in this House on nuclear arms and will vote against them, on the ground that they have never been used and therefore cease to be a deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that the power to birch still exists in the Isle of Man. But I was making the point that in practice it was defunct as a punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was well aware that the right hon. Gentleman had made that point. My point is that youngsters on the Isle of Man, and holidaymakers going there, are not aware that they can no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1504</span>
longer be sentenced to be birched in the Isle of Man. Therefore they probably still think that they can be and therefore if there is a deterrent, it is still there, but apparently is not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak briefly about the Isle of Man. In my intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) I said that the large number of cases in which the birch was used, in the Isle of Man, were not, and would not have been, covered by the new clause. It was used in the main for petty larceny. My figures are a little out of date, but between 1952 and 1971, out of 108 cases of people under the age of 16 being birched, only 20 were so punished for crimes of violence. It is doubtful whether some of the cases could be described as of violence. One of them was for threatening a shopkeeper with menaces. The shopkeeper said "Boo" to the bloke and he ran away, but the offender was still birched. The large number of birchings were for petty larceny by children. One case involved larceny, from a house, of mineral waters and potato crisps. At the age of 10 the boy received two strokes of the birch. He had previously received the birch at the age of 8, although on that occasion he received only one stroke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another case a boy received the birch for the larceny of strawberries and gooseberries from a garden. In England I think that would commonly be called scrumping. The boy aged 12 received three strokes of the birch. There was another case of larceny by a 14-year-old of one bottle of milk. He received two strokes of the birch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus is correct in what he said, but the problem is that in many of those cases, one of which I have just quoted, the boys were back again, either to be birched again—there are quite a few cases of second birchings in this list—or for committing other crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems in following up this matter is that a fair number of those birched in the Isle of Man are from outside the Isle of Man. Therefore, it is not always easy to follow their record of crimes thereafter. That is one of the problems that we face in looking at these statistics. But the evidence suggests that in the Isle of Man birching as a deterrent has not worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When looking at a deterrent, we always have to consider what we mean by it. Who is it deterring? Is it stopping people who normally would not commit crimes of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1505</span>
violence or any crimes from committing crimes? In other words, is it deterring the normal law-abiding citizen? Or, once somebody has committed crime, if he is given this punishment, is he deterred from committing it again? Those are two different ways of looking at deterrents. The evidence from the Isle of Man is that the use of the birch does not deter a man from committing the same crime again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the evidence suggests overwhelmingly that birching does not work, the moral argument that it is a degrading custom has to be overwhelmingly accepted. In other words, it does not work. Therefore, it can be clearly stated that it is morally wrong to introduce a clause of this nature. Therefore, I shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the sincerity of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), as I think all my hon. Friends do. I was a little puzzled and confused at times when he explained how one made progress by going backwards. There were passages of his speech which sounded like the script of a square-dance caller. I expected at any moment to be told to twirl our partners. Although his speech was a bit obscure at times, the sincerity came through, but he was extremely misguided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, speaking as an individual but taking very much a governmental view with regard to treaty obligations, is recommending the Committee to vote against the new clause. I should have been even happier—I am sure that he accepts this—if he had been able to say that on the merits of the argument he had recanted. The Committee will remember that the Under-Secretary of State and the Solicitor-General for Scotland both voted for birching, as did every Conservative Member of the last Committee. In those days we did not have the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), and I welcome the individual stand on the merits of the argument that he took today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pity that the Under-Secretary of State and the Solicitor-General for Scotland not only voted for birching in the last Committee but felt so strongly about it that they signed the new clause: it stood in their name on the Amendment Paper. I was hoping that we would be told in this debate that, having thought about it, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1506</span>
the Svengali influence of the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) having been removed, they had seen matters in a clearer light and recognised that their position was plainly reactionary on the last occasion. But I am afraid that the Minister has chosen to shelter behind the no doubt valid but still rather technical point regarding the Convention on Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us, we happy few, we band of brothers, who keep the European flag flying in the Labour Party, are on occasions somewhat stuck for arguments about the virtues of European institutions. Now at least we can say that European institutions were the kind of intellectual fig-leaf which allowed the Under-Secretary of State to scramble back to respectability on the subject of birching. It has not been a particularly dignified process. If I may say so, we have caught a glimpse of the private parts of his mental processes. I should have been much happier if we had had a conversion on the merits, but for what we have we are grateful. I take it that although it is a free vote, the Under-Secretary also speaks for this latter-day reincarnation of Renaissance man, who presumably will be joining us in voting against this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to go through the arguments at any length. It was a long debate in the last Committee and it has been a long debate today. The statistical evidence is clearly inconclusive. But I am sure that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire would agree that what statistical evidence there is—and we have already quoted the Barry committee report in an intervention—very firmly suggests that it is not a deterrent. From the Isle of Man we have some evidence pointing the same way. I am satisfied from the chief constable's reports that over a very lengthy period in the area of criminal activity—if one can call the kind of petty larcenies involved "criminal activity"—where birching was used, the increase in crime in the Isle of Man has gone up and up throughout that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in the area of violence to which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire referred where there has been an increase of 22 per cent, in recent years, on the Isle of Man's statute book there is still the so-called deterrent of birching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is therefore strong prima facie evidence in the Barry and Cadogan reports
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1507</span>
for suggesting that birching is not an effective deterrent. The Isle of Man provides a misleading comparison. It is an agricultural area and a holiday resort. It is not a heavy industrial urban area like West Central Scotland where there are heavy crime rates. Even if the position on the Isle of Man supported the hon. Gentleman's case, which I do not believe it does, the comparison would be with crime in, say, the Isle of Bute, which shows that up as a useless form of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are driven back on instinct on this occasion in our general social approach to this problem. I do not like it because it is an ineffective deterrent. I do not like it because I believe the delay would be insupportable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Glasgow sheriff courts that deal not only with juveniles, to whom presumably birching would be applicable—is that there are delays of four and five months before trials take place, even if we leave out the complications of stated case procedure and possible appeals. I do not like the almost sadistic approach which says that it is a good thing that we have these delays because the poor bloke can sit there stewing in his own anxieties for four or five months contemplating the possibility of his bare buttocks being whacked with the birch while the legal processes grind to a final halt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with the Minister about birching being degrading. That was the element that was picked up by the European Court on Human Rights. If anyone wants to look at the previous Committee stage they will read quotations about the tripod—about the holding down, the binding and the restraints and degrading indignities that are inevitably part of the process of judicial corporal punishment as it must be carried out if we are to reintroduce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a degrading difficulty for the person being birched, but also for the person doing the birching. It may be that in many ways in general people will agree that there is a place for judicial corporal punishment, but if they were to be asked to do it, to hold down the boy, put on the protective padding and to apply the birch or the cane, most of them would be repelled by the cold, clinical brutality of the procedures which are built into the very nature of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "brutal" and make no apology for doing so. I recognise that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire and others think that this is emotive and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1508</span>
over-strong language. But I believe that if we were to reintroduce a process in Scottish law which in any widespread sense has been dead since 1860, we would be introducing a new barbarism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not going back to the fundamentals of the Old Testament and I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is a latter-day ayatollah. None of us would like to claim the title of holy man, but we would be going back to the law of the Koran. Although that may be appropriate in other parts of the world it certainly is not appropriate today in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brutal penalties in the penal system would make it harder and harder to introduce the reformative elements that we should all like to see. It would make it increasingly difficult to concentrate on rehabilitation which, whatever the difficulties of holding people in a secure environment, should never be lost sight of as one of the principal aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the clause, many of the offenders who might be thought to be appropriate cases for birching will be juveniles, and that would desolate the whole theory and atmosphere of the children's panels system which, I think it is now agreed between both the principal parties—indeed, among all parties in Scotland—has established itself as a successful initiative in dealing with juvenile crime on the Scottish scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Barry committee was set up by a Conservative Home Secretary—Mr. Butler. It had the services of many prominent Conservatives, and I make no complaint about that. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) will remember that they unashamedly said in their report that, at the start of their investigations, they had been heavily split and that many of them had had it in mind that a return to a judicial corporal punishment would be a useful and proper initiative. They unanimously came down against it. Not one of them continued to stand out. All of them had talked to people who had been involved, all of them had studied comparative experiences and current practice in other countries, and they came to the conclusion that birching would be a return to the Middle Ages, that it would be mistaken and retrograde. I believe that they were right, and I hope that the Committee will take a similar view today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion I hope that we do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1509</span>
have a party split on the vote. It will be a free vote on the Opposition side. I hope that we shall be fortunate enough not just to carry with us the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) but many of his colleagues, that our vote will resoundingly say that the clause is ill-conceived. It is misguided to think that there is a short-cut, an easy way out of our difficulties in dealing with violent crime, by reintroducing and importing into the system violence to meet violence. That is not the way forward and I hope that we shall firmly reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 1, Noes 12.</p>
	<p>I do not want to rehearse the arguments on solvent abuse at great length, because I think that they are well known to the Committee. I also believe that there is unanimity in the Committee about the difficulties that we are facing and the public concern that exists.</p>
	<p>May I make my own confession on this occasion. We debated a clause tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) when the Labour Party put forward its Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. On that occasion I made a speech in which I indicated quite strongly that I had a great deal of support for the hon. Gentleman's clause. I did not vote for the clause, although on numerous occasions during the Committee stage I broke ranks.</p>
	<p>One of my reasons for supporting the clause was that I was impressed by what my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said about the difficulties of enforcing legislation in this area. On that occasion I believed it wrong to plunge into a vote when my hon. Friend, who was concerned with the problems himself, felt that legislation would be counter-productive. I have given considerable thought to whether it would be right to bring forward a new clause, given the doubts which I had at that time which prevented me from voting with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West.</p>
	<p>I had two reasons for tabling the clause. First, I have been increasingly concerned</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1511</span>
	<p>about the level of anxiety in my constituency. There have been various efforts to collect statistics which I find somewhat confusing. I do not intend to go through those. I am unashamedly putting forward a personal subjective judgment about the impact of solvent abuse in one particular Glasgow housing scheme.</p>
	<p>There is no doubt in my constituency, particularly in Drumchapel, that a large number of people are genuinely frightened—I use that word in cold blood—about the impact of the habit on young people. I accept that one person's experience does not necessarily give a fair picture. However, a week or so ago I was at a church sale in Drumchapel. I was spontaneously approached by three or four mothers at different times during the morning. Each mother told me that her own children were at risk and that solvent abuse was a social nuisance of such a startling nature that in a fundamental way it was affecting the quality of life in the area in which she lived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us the specific worries of those who approached him? What stood out as the key concern of the parents who spoke to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were many concerns. The first concern was properly for the health and safety of their own children. In any area children are greatly influenced by the habits of their peer group. If people in the close are sniffing and inhaling solvents, it is a strong-minded parent who can protect the child from drifting into the habit himself. Although the habit can be exaggerated in terms of direct injury to health, it has anti-social tendencies, puts children at risk with the law because of the conduct which results from loose living and, in extreme cases, it can directly damage health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents were also worried about the quality of life in their own area. A number of people have spoken to me about the friction which resulted from having to clear glue-sniffers from their own close. For example, I received a letter today from someone who is requesting a housing transfer. The letter mentions that the trouble started because glue-sniffing on the close had become such a problem that the parents felt that they had to try to control it themselves. Remonstrating with the children had led to friction. The friction had escalated and the parents now find them-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1512</span>
selves in an intolerable situation in the house in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that that is common, but perhaps it illustrates how difficult it can be when glue sniffing gets a hold, as I believe it has in that area of my constituency, and also in many other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern is shared by social workers and by the police—in particular by the community involvement branch of the police, with whom I have discussed the matter on a number of occasions. It is also shared by the local authority. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has done a great deal of work on this matter and has called for legislative changes. In my own area, one of my regional councillors, Bill Perry, has worked extremely hard trying to combat this difficulty and gathering statistics about its local incidence. I do not need to labour the point that there is a real depth of concern. People feel that they are being fundamentally affected by a habit which can no longer be seen as a passing phase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been involved in court cases—I think a number of Conservative Members probably have been involved too—when it was revealed that the most startling conduct of young people had resulted from the inhalation of solvents. They had acted in a way which was totally irresponsible. On occasions—I stress on occasions—it has led to the most disastrous consequences for an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked to young people involved in these cases who assure me that they have no memory of carrying on in a way that one would have thought would have been imprinted on their minds when they were running around creating mayhem. Clearly, they did not remember their behaviour, from the evidence that they gave to the courts.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter that we cannot ignore. I say that after a good deal of thought, because it was put to me by one of my hon. Friends that it was wrong to raise the issue again in terms of legislation because legislation could not be policed, the outlets could not be controlled and by discussing legislation we were raising false hopes that, in some way, we could deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take that criticism seriously. Therefore, I do not introduce the clause lightly. However, a number of legislative options have been offered to the Committee.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1513</span>
My new clause proposes that:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be an offence to supply, as part of a commercial transaction, solvents or similar substances which may be inhaled to any person under the age of sixteen years."</p></q>
I shall explain in a minute or two why I favour that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the other two new clauses that stand in the names of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay)—new clauses 7 and 12. Although I accept that they are trying to combat exactly the same evil with the best of motives, I believe that it is not helpful to say that the actual act of sniffing itself should become an offence. If a child is sniffing, it may well be that his conduct will constitute a breach of the peace. If the police find a juvenile who is obviously under the influence and on investigation it turns out that sniffing is a problem with that child, he can be reported through the children's panels system under section 32 of the 1968 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's experience as a reporter in the children's panels system, he will be aware that, under a consultative document published by the Scottish Office in April 1980, a proposal was made that the act of solvent abuse might be made a specific ground of referral to a children's panel. I wonder whether, in pursuing his argument in favour of his new clause, he could indicate how he sees such a separate ground of referral fitting into the whole scheme and whether he would support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not over-enthusiastic about that proposition. That is not because I think that it is positively harmful. I think it may have some dangerous connotations to write the words "glue sniffing" into an Act of Parliament and single out such an act. The provisions of part III of the 1968 Act are comprehensive enough to allow the referral of a child as someone whose conduct is likely to impair or endanger his health. I think that that could be done under present legislation. Therefore, I do not think that specifically to make it either an offence or a specific ground of referral, separated out from the general grounds that are already in the Act, greatly alters the situation. That is why I do not favour the solution proposed in the new clause tabled by two Con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1514</span>
servative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read my clause again and I honestly do not think that it is to that clause that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is alluding. My clause attacks the source of supply—the commercial transaction. Perhaps the hon. Member may like to say something about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. He is absolutely right. He is very much on the same lines as myself. I am sure that he did not want to be lumped in with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire on most matters and I have thoughtlessly done it on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is still valid. I am against making it an offence just to sniff. I prefer to go for the supply. I have a great deal of sympathy—I shall say no more than that at the moment—with new clause 15 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I do not know enough about the technical possibilities, but if we can build in some substance which makes it physically repellent to inhale, I shall be interested to see that developed as well. But I am arguing about new clause 6 and must conclude by saying a few words about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make it an offence to supply to someone under the age of 16 substances which may be inhaled. It is open to the immediate charge that it is unenforceable. Such a wide range of products can be inhaled and sniffed. The case is unlike that of drink, where a limited number of outlets are licensed and therefore can be controlled and policed. I see that argument entirely. By putting forward the clause I am open to the attack that I am putting exhortatory legislation on to the statutory book which cannot be enforced, which is bad for the law and for the system generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a distinction here. Certain shops—I can speak here from knowledge of my own constituency—are known to be extremely careless in the way in which they supply these common products, which are presently being used for inhalation, to youngsters. These are shops which are known to sell without an inquiry, when they know that the product will be abused by the children by sniffing. I could give the names of shops—I have no intention of doing it in this Committee—given to me by my local police
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1515</span>
as causes of real concern to them. The community involvement people have spoken to the shopkeepers in question and have had no success. There has been no response. There is a case for having on the statute book an offence which could be used to deal with people who offend—I use the word with some consideration—in this irresponsible way by allowing their stock to be abused and making no attempt to control their sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged—this is the main point—by the fact that I presume that I have some support in Crown Office for this point of view. As the Solicitor-General will know, a prosecution was brought—I think in 1978—which must have been with the consent of Crown Office, against a shopkeeper called Malik who had a shop in the Maryhill Road, Glasgow. The charge was that on various occasions between certain dates he sold to children and young persons glue, well knowing that they intended to inhale vapour to the danger of their health, and that he did this wilfully and recklessly. That was the burden of the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the case appeared before Sheriff Irvine Smith, an advocate appeared for the shopkeeper and pleaded that this complaint disclosed no offence known to the common law of Scotland and was therefore irrelevant. The sheriff—I understand with some reluctance—upheld that point, and the prosecution therefore collapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is interesting about that case is that the Crown Office presumably sanctioned the attempt. The fiscal in Glasgow, Mr. Skeene, thought that it was worth making, because he was satisfied that categories of shopkeepers were determined to make themselves available to children who wished to buy substances to sniff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Office went so far as to ask for a stated case on this point from the sheriff. The stated case was not proceeded with, presumably because it was felt that, with the law in its present form, there was no reasonable prospect of the sheriff's upholding of the plea of relevancy being overturned. But the Crown Office clearly felt strongly enough about it to think "If we can possibly overturn it, let us get a stated case and see what we can do".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be a prima facie case for saying that there is in official circumstances an acceptance that the kind of abuse by shopkeepers and the course of conduct to which I am referring exist. To deal with this kind of occurrence there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1516</span>
ought to be an offence on the statue book for these extreme cases—for example, if a little grocer in a section of a housing scheme is known not to be co-operating with the police and is known to be selling constantly to kids when there is every indication that the product will be abused. Instead of simply warning him and watching the practice go on, the police can try again reporting him to the fiscal, and the fiscal can, as he did in the case of Malik, take a prosecution, knowing at least that it would be relevant and a matter for the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that this will in any way eliminate glue sniffing, but it would be a helpful, if modest step in that direction. My impression, talking to the community involvement branch of the police, is that they would welcome the provision because it would give them a leverage on those shopkeepers who are refusing to cooperate, and are acting in this irresponsible fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. It would be unfortunate if, owing to our discussing several new clauses, two of which have strong similarities, the Committee were to find itself divided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman tell us more about the Malik case? What were the age groups of those buying substances from the shopkeeper? Do the groups to which he has referred tend to be most active under the age of 16?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They certainly do appear to be active under the age of 16. There was reference at our last sitting to a Toronto seminar. I have read the papers on it in the Library and they made clear that an enormous number of everyday products can be used for solvent abuse of the type we are discussing. But undoubtedly there are certain products which are easily available and which are in fashion at any given time. If we can have a law on the statute book which provides for the shutting off of the easiest source of supply, we may do something to make it harder for children to abuse solvents in the way that they have been doing, and it may do something to stop someone profiting in a particularly cynical way from the habit of glue sniffing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this new clause forward as a modest step which I believe will work, because there has been some sign that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1517</span>
authorities are anxious to have such a mechanism on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note from the stated case put out by Sheriff Irvine Smith that one of the arguments used by the defence in making a plea for irrelevancy, was that the Crown was trying to erect a new offence to combat a social evil. The defence made the point that there was no power to do so, and that legislation was needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a social evil and a need to try to combat it, and that this new clause would be a useful, although limited, step in that direction. At least it would mean that where the police felt that an abuse existed they could raise the prosecution and the supplier could be taught a lesson. Given the level of anxiety and the way in which glue sniffing has become a scourge—as I believe it has in certain areas—I think it would be worth a try. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This problem, I am happy to say, does not have much significance in Argyll, although I shall come later to the only two cases which my research has shown to have occurred in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glue sniffing is particularly a problem in the Glasgow conurbation. I was in Glasgow, Central, for obvious political reasons not long ago and I had a chat with two policemen there who were involved in the community operation of the police force in Glasgow. They told me that they had visited a secondary school, which I shall not name, and they had discussed the problem of glue sniffing with a class of 35 children and found that only seven of those children had not tried it. They did not say that the other 28 were hooked or anything like that, but I found the figure horrifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also taken the trouble over the past few weeks to talk to the children of friends who live in the Glasgow conurbation. From them I heard largely the same horrifying story involving youngsters, predominantly boys, but increasingly, also, girls. At least, the youngster to whom I talked did not think that there was too much to choose between boys and girls in that respect. She painted a pretty horrifying picture of the number of people in her school who indulged in that habit, la habit which spreads by the usual method of "Come on, give it a try. You're a coward if you don't." Undoubtedly, a lot of children, especially those susceptible to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1518</span>
that kind of encouragement, fall for it and try their hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling the new clauses we are asking the Committee to address itself to finding a way around this problem and to help stop more and more children being dragged into this kind of behaviour by the general behaviour of their peers and fellows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire tries in his clause to make it an offence. I have no objection to that, but I wonder whether that would prevent the practice. In the case that I mentioned the two youngsters in Argyll were charged with a breach of the peace. Fortunately, a member of the public passing by was put into a state of fear and alarm by their behaviour, and was public spirited enough to go to court and say what he had encountered. On those grounds the court convicted the two youngsters of a breach of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other instances, of course—I return to what I was told by my young friend—they just go to a hidden place, put on a lookout, and glue sniff, or sniff whatever other substances they have. Even if the police could get round the lookout and catch them at it, it would be difficult to prove a breach of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have chosen to attack the problem at its source. The children have to get the substances from somewhere and if they took it from fathers' and mothers' shelves, it would be a limited practice, because father and mother would jolly soon find out that they were getting through a greater amount of "Stickit" than normal—if I may use that as a general name—and would quickly conclude that the product was not being used for a good purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden, has quoted the case of 1978 of the shopkeeper in Glasgow who was charged with wilfully, culpably and recklessly, knowing that it would be inhaled to the danger of their lives, supplying 12 children with a glue substance. The sheriff said that Parliament would have to outlaw the stuff. That is why we are discussing the matter today because if it is to be made unlawful, it is for us to take that step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause is similar to the new clause which most attracted the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden on that Committee Stage. It was, at that stage, new clause 21, and I have more or less taken it except that I have missed out the age,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1519</span>
because I do not think that the age matters. If a 19 year old boy can buy the glue and take it away to distribute it for sniffing to others, it is as serious as a 17 year old or a 16 year old doing the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause of the hon. Member for Garscadden worries me to this extent. As I read it, it would put a ban on the legitimate sales of lots of substances which are part and parcel of everyday life, and part and parcel of a lot of children's toys and building kits. That may well be a price worth paying for preventing those children who abuse the product from obtaining it through those kits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that some of the more responsible manufacturers of the kits are now using substances that are covered by new clause 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. To make an aside about new clause 15, which is in the name of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), if it were technically and scientifically feasible—and I trust that we may hear more about that—that might be the way to solve the problem and it would save all the other legal complications. If it were found that "Stickit", as I call it, was being used for inhaling, the Government could easily say to the manufacturers of "Stickit": "Put such-and-such a substance into “Stickit", which will have no other consequences to the product but will make it impossible to inhale." That would clearly be the easiest way out of our dilemma about legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the other new clauses, we may eventually have to pay the price of not having these products on sale for children, in building kits and so on, if the problem cannot be overcome in any other way. But my new clause, like that of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), attacks the problem at its source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the substance I mentioned, "Stickit". If a corner shop salesman, over the last 10 years, has sold, on average, 50 tubes of "Stickit" a year for the do-it-yourself fanatics in the area, and suddenly the demand for "Stickit" increases enormously, and the age of the do-it-yourself man drops to 16, 15, 13 or 12, one can legitimately expect that trader to ask himself what this is about, especially if he knows that the product can be used as an inhalant. We can legitimately say then that he should stop selling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 12 provides that, if the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1520</span>
trader sells to any person
	<br><q><p>"solvent or similar substance which the supplier has reasonable cause to believe will be inhaled",</p></q>
that would be an offence. If suddenly a trader finds demand going through the ceiling and that the do-it-yourself addict is getting younger and younger, I suggest that he has reasonable cause to suspect that it is being used for inhaling. The clause would give the police the power to go to shops of the kind mentioned by the hon. Member for Garscadden and known to the two police officers to whom I talked in Glasgow, and to say "We shall charge you under this Act if you do not stop." There will be legislation to enable the police to go to a trader who they know is selling this stuff to youngsters and say "No", wave the law at him and stop him. If he does not take their warning, they can take him to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will consider new clause 12 as one way round the problem. I am not particularly torn between any of them. While I do not think that new clause 7, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire, would do great harm, I do not honestly believe that it is the best way to tackle the problem, but that the best way is to do something about the source of supply. If a multiple is involved, the firm will simply have to take that product off their pick-up shelves and put it on other shelves where they can control its sale. I think that that is perfectly feasible. That is the sort of problem we are dealing with. Only when one talks to youngsters who are prepared to be open about what is happening to their friends and colleagues does one realise its significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it is a difficult matter to legislate about, but I remind the Committee that Sheriff Irvine Smith told Parliament that it is up to us to do something about it. The hon. Member for Garscadden, part of whose constituency is clearly bedevilled by it, put the point very clearly that the parents, the schoolteachers and certainly the police are looking to us to take action. It may be impossible, but this morning we ought at least to make the attempt. I hope that new clause 12 will find more favour with the Government than the others and that it may be used as the vehicle for trying to stop this appalling habit among young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1521</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Glue sniffing is definitely a problem, particularly in my constituency. In the Castlemilk area there are, I know, large numbers of youngsters either experimenting with glue sniffing or using it as a fairly regular habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be wary, however, of going overboard too much about the problem, in that the evidence that I have tried to collect suggests that glue sniffing is not addictive. It is something that people enjoy doing and will continue to do, and it has dangers and problems attached to it for some individuals in terms of brain damage, but the evidence suggests that it is Ho more addictive than a packet of cigarettes. I would argue, as one who has tried to give them up on many occasions, that cigarettes are very addictive. But glue is no more addictive than cigarettes and nicotine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence suggests that most children give up the habit at the age of 18 and do not return to it. They may move to alcohol, but it is legal for them to so do at that age. Glue sniffing is not a problem of the late teens or 20s or older than that, it is something which children do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that it causes some brain damage, and in a few cases it causes death. It is also a social abuse that many people find abhorrent, for instance, if one finds a group of kids blown out of their minds from sniffing this stuff and not aware of what they are doing. Many council house tenants in my constituency have this problem. It is not necessarily the parents who complain; it is other people who complain to me bacause of the behaviour of the youngsters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee must consider why youngsters go in for glue sniffing while their elders go in for heavy drinking. It is not only a matter of making it an offence. It is not sufficient to look to legislation to cure problems of drink or glue sniffing. We should look at the wider social problems and conditions under which such people live and try to solve those as well. That has been a constant theme of mine throughout the Committee stage and I am glad to be able to say it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it will be possible to introduce what one might call a probing new clause, but I certainly see my new clause in that light although I accept that there could be major drawbacks to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United States they have tried to solve the problem by putting in a sub-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1522</span>
stance—I gather it is some form of mustard—so that when someone inhales it he will be violently ill. For once I am using the deterrent argument. If a person is violently ill from inhaling it, he is unlikely to sniff it again because it would be so unpleasant. Some companies have tried this substance and it has been suggested that this may be the best way of solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has told me that the previous Labour Government looked at this repellant as a possible way of tackling the problem. I understand that the Government consulted some companies involved and that Airfix used this in substances for the manufacture of toys, although there is a slight loss of adhesiveness. Therefore, it may be that certain substances could not be put into the category. Perhaps that is where my new clause 15 could become a joint one with new clause 6 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that to introduce the new clause for Scotland creates problems, as Scotland is only a small part of the market for the manufacturer of solvents. A solvent manufacturer may say "We sell 90 percent, of our product in England and Wales. We sell only 10 per cent, in Scotland. Rather than increase the costs of manufacture over the whole of the United Kingdom, we prefer to cancel out the whole of the 10 per cent, and accept that 90 per cent, is better than the 100 per cent, we had before."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister responds in that way, and if he is prepared to say that it is a feasible operation in other ways, will he take the matter up with the Home Secretary, to see whether it could be done on a United Kingdom basis, rather than just on a Scottish basis? I accept that there are problems in doing it at purely a Scottish level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is feasible—and there is some evidence from the United States that it can be done in this way—it would seem to be the best way forward. This will mean that people will not do it. Of course, other substances may be found that will be used instead, but at least it will take out of the glue-sniffing area large numbers of substances used at present. It will obviate the need for the other parts of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1523</span>
Of course, certain products will have to be excluded, although they are not products largely sold on the open market. For instance, one cannot have glue with an inhalant repellent used on envelopes which are to be licked. As soon as the envelope is licked, the person would be sick, so it cannot be used for that purpose, but the self-adhesive envelope could be more widely used to get round that difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and there are problems, but I hope that the Minister will respond to see if this could be a way forward in solving this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief after my earlier lengthy speech. I am delighted that I am not in grand isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak to new clause 7 because of the concern that is felt among parents for the health of their children in my constituency where it has become the practice of youngsters to indulge in this obnoxious and dreadful habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of these areas are already well known to the police. But the present laws are not adequate to deal with the problem that now exists. We must recognise that these youngsters are deliberately purchasing these substances and in some instances shopkeepers are deliberately selling them. They are deliberately, wilfully and recklessly selling these products, knowing that by doing so they are contributing to the danger and risk to children's health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that new clause 15 with provision for a repellent is an attractive clause. I think that the hon. Member for Cathcart would acknowledge the difficulties—indeed, he has said so—of endeavouring to bring this into legislation which affects only a small part of the consumer market. However, it has some appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept that new clauses 6 and 12, tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), also have some appeal because they endeavour to deal with the root cause, namely, the selling of the product. So many of these products are in common use that I can see enormous difficulties in endeavouring to make this work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that some shopkeepers who are known by the police would be caught. When those shopkeepers are caught, in my experience of the ingenuity of these children, they will go somewhere else. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1524</span>
must deal with the offenders as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the clause that I tabled may not be acceptable to the Government. There may be some aspects with which they do not agree, and there could be drafting problems. But I would remind the Committee that the effects of inhaling these substances are not dissimilar to the effects of alcohol. The results are that the children often become violent and disturbed. That is why the parents are deeply concerned about the effect on the children's health, how it affects their schooling and how they fit in with their fellows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a need for the Government to take action. I trust that if the Government cannot accept any of the new clauses they will at least give us an assurance that they will look at the problem and do something about it at a later stage—possibly in another place. However, something has to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, both the Government and the Crown Office take an extremely serious view of solvent abuse and inhalation and its prospective criminal effects and, to a lesser extent, its prospective health hazards. It is an insidious craze. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, it is difficult for a child in its peer group to escape from allegations of cowardice, squareness or being chicken, if he declines to indulge in what to him appears to be a grown-up and daring activity. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) made the same point.

The question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll is simple. He said that we should find a way, if there is a way. The difficulty is finding a way. I shall deal with each new clause in turn to see whether it is a realistic answer to the question, because the two groups of clauses are directed to different matters. The new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Garscadden and the hon. Member for Argyll are directed to prevention as, in a way, is that tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart

Mr. Maxton). The clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is directed towards curing or, if not curing, to deterring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both are fundamentally desirable and excellent objectives. I wish to draw to the attention of the Committee the views of those who have to deal with the matter on whether legislation is the best way of dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, when I come to the individual clauses I do not wish to be a kind of Scrooge—finding problems to any solutions—but, there are such grave and weighty problems to any of the solutions that any of us have yet thought of that we should pause before indulging in legislation which has such massive difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment which on the last occasion we debated this matter stood in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and the amendment which stood in my name and that of my hon. Friend who is now the Under-Secretary were also different approaches to the same problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West, as hon. Members will remember, gave us the benefit of all the research which had been done into the matter in North America. That was extremely helpful to the Committee. My hon. Friend and I withdrew our amendments because the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland is wrong. There was a vote on one of the new clauses at the end of the Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I forget the precise proceedings. I apologise to the Committee. However, the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth argued cogently, first, that the legislation was so difficult that it was defective. I accept that. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It appears that I voted "Aye" on clause 21. However I voted, I saw the strength of the hon. Gentleman's argument. The hon. Member for Garscadden must have voted "no", otherwise we might have passed it. But this is a problem on which we all agree that we must find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall explain the extent of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1526</span>
problem. The problem arises because the element carbon is capable of combining with itself indefinitely, so there is no limit to the number of inhalable organic substances which can be produced from carbon or benzine rings. That is one of the great difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, there is almost no limit to the range of normal and household substances which contain and must contain an intoxicant solvent which is an inhalant, because one of the requirements of a very large number of substances is that the medium evaporates, and it is essentially evaporants that are sought. One can think of innumerable substances that contain such elements. I do not wish to put ideas into anyone's mind, but obviously cleaning substances of every kind are involved—a large number of motor substances such as petrol as well as lighter fuels, shoe cleaning substances, and so on. There are innumerable substances which can produce this effect and the grave danger is that if there is the urge to obtain it and it is a dare, the more difficult it is to obtain it the greater the dare. It is because of the grotesque difficulty of excluding all substances that the scale of the problem rises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who were present on the last Bill will recall what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said. I should like briefly to explain what is being done and what has been done since he spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first important matter is health education. Certainly it is considered to be the much more hopeful path to follow by the police and those who are involved in health and social work. Under the previous Administration there was conveyed in letters to the director of social work, to the chief administrative medical officers, the chief constables and directors of education the necessity for bringing to the notice of children the dangers of this practice and the necessity for their being aware of the problem and co-operating at all levels, through the Scottish Health Education Unit, to identify those who are affected by it, those who are threatened by it, and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, the matter was further considered by an ad hoc group of the Advisory Council on Social Work, which recommended that the practice was best dealt with by continuing education about its dangers rather than by attempting to find legislative formulae which have grotesque laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1527</span>
Views are currently being sought by the Scottish Office. A consultative document on children's hearings issued on 30 April discussed the suggestion that solvent abuse should be made an additional ground for the referral of children to children's panels. I should have said to my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) that glue sniffing is on the whole a teenage craze. Therefore to introduce—as his clause does—penalties such as those under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is inappropriate. It is, therefore, important to decide whether solvent abuse should be made of itself a ground for referral to a children's hearing. That would require legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde police started the experiment and their inspector of constabulary has written to all chief constables to ensure that any information about solvent sniffing cases coming to the notice of the police is forwarded to the reporters of children's panels who are then in a position to consider whether there are grounds for referral to a children's hearing. A great deal of preventive work has been done in this area, I am glad to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell the Committee what the police do when it comes to their attention that a child has been indulging in solvent inhalation. When a child is reported as having been glue sniffing, or is caught by the police having sniffed glue, the child and the parents are brought together in the police station. The position is explained to them and the parents are requested to warn the child, in front of the community police officer, of the danger and consequences of what he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That valuable service has been rendered by the Strathclyde police youth advisory service, and has now been extended to the other forces in Scotland. In more serious cases the children may be admitted to hospital for treatment. Others have been referred to the social work department because of a multiplicity of family problems. In all cases there is a procedure for dealing with any child found to be glue sniffing in a non-criminal way. That is an important practice. As hon. Members have said this activity is not addictive in the sense that a child will do it for the rest of his life. It is a teenage craze, although it has extremely unpleasant attendant factors. A
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1528</span>
child who continues the practice despite such warnings, which suggests that he is beyond parental control, can be reported to the children's panel under section 32 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way that is already a method of referring a child to a children's panel, but the child must be beyond parental control. In other words, repeated warnings by the parents have not been sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the particular clauses and deal with what I see as the fundamental difficulties in each of them. New clause 6, tabled by the hon. Member for Garscadden, reads:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be an offence to supply, as part of a commercial transaction, solvents or similar substances which may be inhaled to any person under the age of sixteen years."</p></q>
That covers a vast range of substances. A child could not, for instance, buy aftershave lotion to give his father for Christmas or scent for his mother on her birthday or on Mother's Day. Nor could it obtain a vast range of simple substances—a tin of Brasso, for example—which are sold in thousands to children for legitimate purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the purpose of the hon. Member. I wish I could find the formula myself, or that somebody could come up with one in which the definition does not exclude and frustrate the vast amount of ordinary everyday activity on behalf of persons under 16 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland is making an important point and I am seized of it. The clause, as drafted, would not do for the reasons that he has given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the kind of language that was used in the complaint in the Malik case? Perhaps some form of words could be used to the effect that he did sell certain substances "knowing they were likely to be" and so on. Youngsters repeatedly go into a shop and the shopkeeper knows why they keep going in. Of course, it poses a problem for the court in making up its mind whether the shopkeeper had that knowledge, but there are circumstances when that knowledge could fairly be inferred. In those circumstances, the Malik type of prosecution ought to be available to the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that new clause 6 will not do as drafted, but if we altered it to take in that element—selling substances which can be inhaled knowing that they are likely to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1529</span>
inhaled—would that not be a solution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that difficulty later. At the moment we are trying to define the substance that the shopkeepers know is likely to be used in that way. It is difficult and has been beyond the capacity of the draftsmen, or myself, or my colleagues, to think of a definition which fits that substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, how does one have a definition? Not by subsection (3) where the Secretary of State would need a schedule which would list every one of the 25,000 million organic substances created by man, because another could always be added. It would be extremely difficult because one could always make an ethylene or ether derivative, it could be got round so easily. Any chemist can get round it without the slightest difficulty—that is the problem. Daily, in all advanced countries, new organic substances which would qualify are being invented. "Hurrah, hurrah, we've got something which enables us to have Superglue and which will stick your eyelids together in two seconds flat."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an endless process and that is the difficulty of trying to define categories. It would be legislatively impossible for the Secretary of State, or any Secretary of State, to have a list—he would do nothing else but ban those substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that problem aside there is the difficulty of not being able to sell substances which one thinks will be used for that purpose. If people are not sold glue, they will buy Thawpit. If they are not sold Thawpit they will buy Brasso. If they are not sold Brasso they will buy perfume and, failing that, they will buy after-shave lotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so on the latter difficulty, the proposal of the hon. Member for Cathcart, is excellent, except that he would have to put this repellent into scent and after-shave lotion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that some people who wear both manage to add the repellent personally, but so far as I am aware they are thought to have rather different intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Cathcart is not here, but there is an even more fundamental difficulty with adding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1530</span>
repellents. The repellent has to be such, first, that it prevents any significant inhalation and, second, that, if inhaled, it does not do medical harm. For instance, bitter aloes are put on children's fingernails to stop them biting their nails, but there are plenty of children who can say "I can take the taste of bitter aloes, thanks. I want to bite my nails." Therefore, some children would say that they wanted the effect so much that they did not care about the nauseating smell of carbon disulphide. That has to be in a situation in which that is not a health risk to the child. Nobody has discovered a repellent which would not be a greater risk if inhaled than the original solvent. Therefore, that is the difficulty and also, as the hon. Member for Cathcart wisely said, it has to be a substance which does not negative the intention of the product in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps one of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends could convey to him the fact that the SHHD is not aware that any manufacturer has developed an effective inhalant repellent. He mentioned Airfix, but if he has information on such a subject, I should be very much obliged if he would let me have it. Perhaps I can have a word with him afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next difficulty to which we come is that of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). This brings me to the point suggested by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—the formula in Malik. I am obliged to him for pointing out that that prosecution was taken with the blessing and encouragement of the Crown Office. That was because we should like to find a method. The common law might be a better medium than statute law for searching for such a thing. But, unfortunately, with the death of the institutional writers, the extension of common law is not as easy as it was in those days. I had not thought immediately that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) was an institutional writer, but I shall be happy to regard him as one in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty of the hon. Member for Argyll is the phrase
	<br><q><p>"to any person solvent or similar substance".</p></q>
Since this is not a commercial transaction, if the parent were to give the child some Airfix or if a 17-year-old goes and buys it to avoid the difficulty of the hon. Member for Garscadden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can cure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1531</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but before we cure it, should we cure it? Surely the solution would be to say to big brother "Nip along, will you, and buy some glue", because big brother, being over 16, is not caught under the hon. Member's clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is making a strong case on most of the points, but he now seems to be pushing the boat out too far. If the first subsection of the new clause of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) were amended to read
	<br><q><p>"It shall be an offence to supply, as part of a commercial transaction, to any person solvent or similar substances which the supplier has reasonable cause to believe will be inhaled",</p></q>
that would allow the Malik type of prosecution to go ahead. I think that we all agree that there are certain circumstances in which that would be totally justified. To say that even then it would be possible to send one's big brother to buy it to get round the problem is an argument against,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1532</span>
for example, having prohibitions on the purchase of drink by juveniles. Very often an adult is sent into the off-sales to get the carry-out, but no one is suggesting that that is a reason for saying "Let us allow the 14-year-old to go in and do it anyway."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Member for Garscadden misunderstood me. I was not pushing the boat out too far. I had inadvertently got off the boat. I shall get back on it again. We have enough trouble with the people who are over age buying drink for people who are under age. In a craze of this kind, where it is almost a symbol of virility, it would be likely that that abuse would occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
