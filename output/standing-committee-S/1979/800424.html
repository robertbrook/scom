<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I feel something like the bowler in a cricket match having the ball returned to him from the wicket keeper through the first slip, the second slip, the third slip, through the mid-wicket and back to the bowler. Just as he has the ball returned through sets of various hands, I have had a message passed to me through various voices—from an hon. Member opposite who, I understand, spoke to another hon. Member opposite, who, I understand, spoke to the Government Chief Whip, who certainly spoke to me and said that the remarks that I passed during my second contribution to the debate on Tuesday morning—which can be found on page 98 of the photocopied record of the proceedings that we have available to the Committee this morning—could easily have been misunderstood and misinterpreted in relation to the whereabouts of the Solicitor-General.<br><br>
On re-reading those remarks, I fully accept, Mr. Gourlay, that it would have been much better had I not said what I said. The last thing I want to do is to offend the Solicitor-General, or any other member of the Committee. Therefore, I unreservedly withdraw those remarks and apologise to the Solicitor-General if they have caused him any offence.</span></p>
<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say that I fully accept that apology, which is given in the best parliamentary traditions. I am sure that the hon. Member did not mean to give any offence, but one does not want misunderstandings to arise.</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Opposition, Mr. Gourlay, I beg to move:
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesday 29 April and Tuesday 6 May at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and thereafter, with effect from Tuesday 13 May, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for moving the motion. I think that we should place on record that its effect will be that the Committee will not sit on Thursday 1 May or Thursday 8 May. I think also that, with my responsibilities on the Opposition Front Bench, I should apologise to the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart). These matters were discussed in the five or 10 minutes before the Committee met this morning, and it would be wrong if the right hon. Gentleman gained the impression that he was excluded from any such consideration. For our part, I accept the motion that the Under-Secretary has moved, and thank him for it.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. At a quarter to 10 this morning I went to the Vote Office to try to obtain a copy of the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings on Tuesday and was unable to do so. When we came in this morning, we were able to obtain this typescript copy, which is rather difficult to read and follow.<br><br>
For Tuesday's sitting, I accept that it is perhaps not of vital importance that Members have the printed record this morning, because the debate was in the main on the sittings motion. But there will be times when it will be essential on a Thursday morning to have the proceedings of the preceding Tuesday, because the debate will be continued and we shall wish to know what others have said—and, perhaps, what we ourselves have said.<br><br>
I should be grateful, Mr. Gourlay, if you could try to ensure that we have the <i>Official Reports</i> of proceedings in adequate time to study them before the Committee starts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair beat the hon. Gentleman to it by trying to obtain copies of the <i>Official Report</i> last night. It was then that I learnt that there had been industrial trouble where the <i>Official Report</i> is printed. The <i>Hansard</i> people generously undertook to provide typescript copies for the Committee. The reason why they were not in the Vote Office was that they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
being reserved for members of the Committee. That is why the hon. Gentleman could not obtain a copy this morning. We can only deprecate the reasons for the <i>Official Report</i> not being available. The House authorities are doing their best in the current situation.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed [22 April],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 12, Schedule 4, Clauses 13 to 26, Schedule 1, Clauses 27 to 32, Schedule 2, Clause 33, Schedule 3, Clauses 34 to 44, Schedule 5, Clauses 45 to 80, Schedules 6, 7 and 8, Clause 81; New Clauses; New Schedules.—[<i>Mr. Rifkind</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will recall, Mr. Gourlay, that at our last sitting I discussed with you the question of an amendment which at that time I had wished to move in relation to the point at which clauses 1 to 12 should be considered.<br><br>
I note that that amendment has not been accepted. Might I ask whether an alternative manuscript amendment to the motion would be accepted, which would have the effect of omitting clauses 1 to 5 at the beginning and inserting them after clause 81?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall accept the hon. Gentleman's manuscript amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I beg to move, as an amendment to the Question, leave out first '1' and insert '6'.<br><br>
This would have the effect of postponing our consideration of part I, clauses 1 to 5. I do it to help the Committee, as always. If I had succeeded with my initial amendment, clauses 1 to 12 would have been postponed, running beyond part I, and it seemed more appropriate that I should therefore restrict my aim, at great sacrifice, to this present one. The effect would be, with my following amendment which would insert clauses 1 to 5 after clause 81, to allow longer consideration to be given to the crucial part I of the Bill dealing with detention and search.<br><br>
Throughout all the discussions that have been taking place in Scotland on these matters, it is particularly around the powers of search that the anger and anxiety have been most forcefully expressed. I share that anger and anxiety.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
What has come out commonly from all sources is that time should be given for proper consultations, particularly—I know that this will appeal to many hon. Gentlemen—by and with sections of the legal profession and that, at the end of that, possibly a Green Paper should be issued so that all agencies or interests which would be affected or involved, not just the community at large but the legal profession, the social work departments and so on, would understand the full implications. That is the purpose of my proposal. Time is needed.<br><br>
I am encouraged to believe that we may have support in this from hon. Members on the Government Benches, because I see that the number of lawyers opposite has been strengthened by the arrival of the Solicitor-General. I am pleased that he is here. When I saw a heading in yesterday's <i>Glasgow Herald</i> which read "Fairbairn goes to receiver", I was anxious lest that was the reason for his absence. I am glad that he is here, undetained, unsearched, and in his proper place.<br><br>
I have given the hon. and learned Gentleman certain stick in the past and shall continue to do so when necessary, but I just want to say in passing, in view of the exchanges earlier this morning, that I have found him extremely helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not go too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go too far, I assure my hon. Friend. But he will know what I am talking about. On individual cases that I have raised with him, I have found the Solicitor-General helpful. I wish that he would develop the same helpfulness that he has shown in individual cases and apply it in his general approach to criminal matters.<br><br>
I do not wish to detain the Committee. Everyone understands the background and the reason for my proposal. I have, hopes and, indeed, expectations that it will be accepted by the Minister and, above all, by the other five advocates on his side who will understand exactly why we require this postponement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that the Government are unable to accept the amendment. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will be aware that there has been discussion and consultation on these clauses at least since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
1975, when the proposals were first put. The Bill was considered in this order in another place, and there seems to be no appropriate reason for simply delaying by a few weeks our proper consideration of it in the order proposed. It is, of course, in exactly the same order as was used for the Labour Government's Bill. There seems to be no reason for changing this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make one point? These proposals were not put in 1975. They include fresh proposals that were not in the original Bill. There was no consultation by the previous Government because they had no intention of introducing this clause on search. In the light of that clarification, I am sure that the Under-Secretary will withdraw his opposition to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even the report of the Scottish Council on Crime, from which the stop and search powers proceed, has been known and discussed for several years now. It is therefore unnecessary for me to respond in the way that the hon. Gentleman wishes. In fact, the report of the Scottish Council on Crime was also published in 1975, and therefore there has been full time for consultation.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Main Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 12, Schedule 4, Clauses 13 to 26, Schedule 1, Clauses 27 to 32, Schedule 2, Clause 33, Schedule 3, Clauses 34 to 44, Schedule 5, Clauses 45 to 80, Schedules 6, 7 and 8, Clause 81: New Clauses; New Schedules.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the amendments.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out from 'person' to second 'to' in line 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall consider at the same time amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 15, leave out from 'person' to 'who' in line 17.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is a sinister phrase, but this is a probing amendment. I hope that the Committee will be able to deal with it in fairly short order. It goes over ground which was covered in the last Bill, and I am afraid that the debate then wandered—if that be the right word, and no doubt I played my part in it—over many pages of <i>Hansard.</i> Like many amendments to which we shall come, this has its genesis in the precise mind of the present Solicitor-General, because he moved an amendment to delete the corresponding words in the Labour Administration's Criminal Justice Bill. He introduced his amendment briefly, and this is the kernel of what he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am particularly interested in the brevity of statute law, and particularly offended by verbiage".—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
I, too, am offended by unnecessary verbiage of one sort and another, and the question which arises is whether this is unnecessary. That is what I wish to address my mind to, and perhaps at the same time invite the hon. and learned Gentleman to clarify one or two points of importance.<br><br>
In the Labour Government's measure, the corresponding words were:
<br><blockquote><p>"if he finds him at that place"</p></blockquote>
—which is similar to the present drafting—
<br><blockquote><p>"or in any public place".</p></blockquote>
The present Government have changed that to:
<br><blockquote><p>"at any place where the constable is entitled to be"</p></blockquote>
and I am curious to know why.<br><br>
As I understand it, the anxiety which the Conservative Front Bench expressed on that occasion was that the specific reference to "in any public place" was in some way a limiting form of words which would presuppose that the powers granted to a constable under clause 1 would not be available in a private place. That point was made at some length by the hon. and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
learned Gentleman the present Solicitor-General. After making some interesting remarks on the operation of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, to which I shall certainly return later when we reach the powers of search clause, he went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"It seems to me quite absurd that, if it so happens that the constable is called to private premises with the permission of the owner for the very same purpose as he would be called for to any public place, the Bill suddenly ceases to have effect."</p></blockquote>
He then went on to use quite strong language:
<br><blockquote><p>"That seems to me quite wrong, quite purposeless and quite unprincipled. That is the present effect of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
He added that
<br><blockquote><p>"the concept of sanctuary in any private place is a strange one."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 23–24.]</p></blockquote>
With the hon. and learned Member's well known interest in antiquarian matters and the niceties of olden times, I should have thought that the concept of sanctuary might appeal to him. But there is somewhere in here quite an important point. As I understand it, the Government are trying to avoid the restriction of limiting this clause to a public place by bringing in the new form of words,
<br><blockquote><p>"at any place where the constable is entitled to be".</p></blockquote>
I deduce from his remarks on the last Bill that the Solicitor-General wants to ensure that there should be no right of sanctuary in private premises. I think he owes us an explanation of exactly what he means. It was obviously a point of some importance to his hon. Friends, because they forced a vote on it, and it was a tied vote at 7 to 7. We want to find out exactly what lies behind this.<br><br>
There is no dispute that if the powers under clause 1 are being used at the locus, that is perfectly clear and simple and is covered by
<br><blockquote><p>"if the constable finds him at that place".</p></blockquote>
If, however, we go on to consider private premises, we want to know what is involved. Let us suppose, for example, that a policeman calls at a private house six or seven months after a suspected offence. It is one of the peculiarities of the clause that there is no time limit between the suspected offence and the point where the powers may be used.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
Let us suppose that the policeman has called at the house for a reason that may have happened to most of us; because we have forgotten to pay a parking fine—and he has come to question us on that matter. One might very well invite the police constable into one's house, as any normal and reasonable citizen would. Let us suppose that the constable's eye then falls on one's 17-year-old son and he says, "Gosh, six months ago that lad scattered from a scene of a potential offence, and at that stage he might have been a witness." Now, six months later, in the private house which he has entered for a totally different reason, he wants to bring into play the provisions of clause 1.<br><br>
That seems to me to be perfectly possible. Perhaps it is not an everyday occurrence but it is not an outlandish set of circumstances, and I want to know whether the Solicitor-General is including such circumstances in the new form of wording which he has put in the Bill.<br><br>
It seems to me important that we should not remove all restrictions and limitations, particularly in terms of a witness. After all, these words refer to a witness as well as to a suspect, and we should not remove all restrictions, particularly in the case of a witness. If it merely means that the powers shall be enforceable at the place, or at any place where the constable is entitled to be, for example, if he is invited into a house or if he has a search warrant to enter a house in connection with an offence, it seems to me that the words are redundant anyway, and we go back to the point so succinctly and eloquently put by the Solicitor-General in the previous debate, which is that we should get rid of them because they are otiose and redundant verbiage.<br><br>
If it means more than that we want a definition and some enlightenment. Therefore, although, as I say, this is a probing amendment it raises points of considerable importance. I shall limit my remarks to that at this stage and listen with interest to what the Solicitor-General has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly anticipates the purpose of the words. He will remember, as he has referred to the debate, that the effect of the words in the previous Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
were that wherever and on whatever occasion, and for whatever reason, a constable was on private property he could not exercise the powers under clause 1 as the previous Bill was framed. That seemed quite unrealistic.<br><br>
These words are in the Bill, and it is now said by the hon. Member that they are not necessary. If one leaves them out altogether and says that the constable, may require the person to give his name and address, that leaves it completely open. I think it right that the Bill should indicate that where he suspects that an offence has been committed, or anywhere else where he is entitled to be, he is entitled to exercise this power. It lets people know on the face of the statute that the power can be exercised in any of those places.<br><br>
The hon. Member said that he thought we should pay some attention to the sanctuary of private premises. I know something about the concept of sanctuary because Scotland Yard was sanctuary from the laws of England for the first Scottish Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, where the law of Scotland applied but the law of England did not, so that they could not be arrested because they were still allegedly in rebellion.<br><br>
But the concept of sanctuary is very limited, and if a constable has no right to be in a private dwelling—for instance, if he is not invited in and he does not have a warrant—he cannot exercise these powers, so someone would have sanctuary in that situation. If, on the other hand, he is entitled to be where he is—of course, a private place may include such things as a garage or a shop, or parts of shop premises—I think it important that there should be this power.<br><br>
If a constable happens to wander into a bus station and sees somebody who six months previously he suspected of having committed an offence, or if he wanders into a house in order to collect a parking fine and happens to see somebody who six months previously he suspected of having committed an offence, and the only power he can exercise under this clause is to ask him to give his name and address and an explanation of the circumstances which gave rise to his suspicion, then, if the householder wishes to say to the constable "Please leave now; thank
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
you very much. I have dealt with my parking fine, and you are no longer entitled to be on my premises", he will have to go.<br><br>
So it is quite clear that it is any place where the constable is entitled to be, be it public or private. That seems a much more sensible arrangement than the previous rigid exclusion which really made no sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. I had not got a great deal of sympathy initially with my hon. Friend's amendment. I accept that it is a probing amendment, but is seemed to me to make matters slightly worse. But as the Solicitor-General has explained it, it appears to me that the Government's provision is, in the words that he used in an earlier debate, otiose and unnecessary, because, as he said, essentially the law already quite specifically states where a constable can do certain things and where he cannot. If that is the case, is there any reasonable ground for including it in a Bill of this nature, making an amendment and an extension to the existing law? Why take something which is already in law and put it into a Bill? Is that not unnecessary verbiage, as he himself suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not invite my hon. Friends to press this matter to a Division. That would be unnecessary. The Englishman's home is his castle, and no doubt his sanctuary, and even in Scotland we have exceptions. There are even Scotsmen who have castles and sanctuaries. I am, of course, anxious that the sanctuary of Fordell Castle should be inviolate against all assaults.<br><br>
I am to some extent reassured, though not entirely convinced, by the Solicitor-General's remarks. I am grateful to him for the assurance that the entitlement to be on private property can be ended and we are not therefore in a situation where, having got in on one ground and having discovered an object of suspicion which might be the subject of inquiries under clause 1, there is a foot in the door and, even though the owner says "We want you to leave" the constable can in fact stay on.<br><br>
The categorical assurance of the Solicitor-General that that entitlement can be ended by the person whose private
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0107">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
property it is is of some reassurance to us. However, although the distinction he draws may be good in law, in practice—as so often in this part of the Bill, and more controversially later on—it may be hard to achieve.<br><br>
My worry—we may return to this later—is the acceptance of the Solicitor-General that it may be many months after the reasonable grounds for suspicion have arisen that the powers under clause 1 are to be implemented. I should have thought that, if there were any merit in clauses 1 and 2, it would be that they should follow hard upon the incident which gives rise to the suspicion. An unlimited period, which may be six months, a year or even 18 months, gives cause for alarm.<br><br>
Finally, I am unconvinced because I think that the words as now explained by the Solicitor-General are largely redundant. Clearly, the powers are meaningless if they cannot be exercised by the police at the locus of the offence, and if the qualification is
<br><blockquote><p>"at any place where the constable is entitled to be"</p></blockquote>
It does not seem to me that that adds very much to the store of our knowledge. I could see the point of an argument about whether the old drafting was right or wrong about restricting it to a public place, but if that has gone we seem to be in danger of merely stating the obvious here. But as there will be many occasions when the obvious or not obvious will be subject to debate, on this occasion I am prepared to be satisfied. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 12, leave out from 'address' to end of line 14.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<p>No. 7, in page 1, line 21, leave out '(either or both)'.</p>
<p>No. 9, in page 1, leave out line 26.</p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a more substantial matter. The effect of these amendments would be to withdraw certain powers which a constable could exercise under clause 1.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
The first is the power to require a person who is suspected of having committed an offence to give his name and address. The second is to ask him for an explanation of the circumstances which have given rise to the constable's suspicion.<br><br>
It is clear that this is a two-tier clause as envisaged by the Government. The clause says that the suspected person can be required to give his name and address. That is peremptory by any standard. But it then goes on to a deliberate change of mood and wording. When it comes to giving an explanation, it is not a matter of requiring him to give an explanation but of empowering the constable to ask him for an explanation. That is obviously a much softer approach.<br><br>
That impression is very much reinforced by the fact that, if we chase down the clause, we find in subsection (5) that a sanction is written in for the person who refuses to give his name and address or who gives a false name and address, but there is no sanction—very properly, in my view—for someone who fails to give an explanation of the circumstances.<br><br>
The words used are of significance. In the debate on the previous Bill, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) specifically moved an amendment to leave out "ask" and to insert a much more peremptory requirement for giving an explanation. That amendment was not accepted and has not reappeared. So obviously the Under-Secretary has had second thoughts about his own amendment then and his considered judgment is that we should have this two-tier arrangement. In other words, there should be a sanction and requirement upon a person to give his name and address but it is merely a request—something bordering on an opportunity offered—to give an explanation as to the facts.<br><br>
I think that that difference is based on a recognition that if a constable says to someone that he wants an explanation in circumstances of this kind, he is getting into the area of the right to silence. What is implied in the Government's drafting is a recognition that, if we make it an absolute requirement to give an explanation, it would be an attack upon the right of silence; hence the somewhat diffident approach, the request, the lack of a sanction.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
What I am saying is that that recognition of the difference should be taken to a logical conclusion. Instead of just doing it in this half-hearted sort of way, slightly apologetically, we should not do it all. The request to give an explanation at this point should be removed from the clause. That is important.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to consider the circumstances in which this request will be made. I agree that many models may be constructed, but the typical case is one in which the police come upon a set of circumstances, probably in the street, in which they have reasonable cause for suspecting that an offence is being committed by Mr. X. At that point they grab hold of Mr. X, or persuade Mr. X to stay with them, and they ask for his name and address. That is a comparatively short process and, we hope, a comparatively simple one. But they then go on to ask him to give an explanation of the circumstances.<br><br>
I have been in a situation, as no doubt many others on the Committee have, of hearing a caution being administered. I have had cause to remark previously that it is an enormous human temptation to accept an invitation. They say "We want an explanation", and then there is a long, horrible silence. Someone is tempted to blunder in in panic with an explanation. What is particularly dangerous is that we sometimes assume that that explanation, because it is made in panic and in haste, is the truth. It may not be. Panic leads people to make stupid decisions and to blurt out all sorts of quick explanations because they suddenly realise that they are in trouble. The most damaging explanations—damaging not only to the suspect but ultimately, too, to the cause of justice—can be made in such situations.<br><br>
I am therefore extremely worried about the hot pursuit situation, as it were, and the demand for an explanation at that moment. I am anything but reassured—I am sure that the Solicitor-General will accept this—by the caution, if it can be called a caution, which has to be administered before that explanation can be asked for. The Committee will be familiar with it, and we find it arising in subsection (4), which provides that a constable shall inform a person
<br><blockquote><p>"of his suspicion and of the general nature of the offence which he suspects that the person has committed or is committing".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
It seems to me that that is an inadequate caution. We shall come to that on amendment No. 12. If amendment No. 12 was incorporated in the Bill, it would do something to allay my worries. But I should much prefer to get rid of this whole part of the clause rather than try to bolster it with safeguards, as I seek to do in amendment No. 12. I should prefer to do without it.<br><br>
I do not want to go on at too great length because the line of my argument will already be emerging to the Committee, but may I deal with some of the remarks made by the Solicitor-General on the Labour Government's Bill. I hope that he will forgive me if I say that he sometimes falls in love with the colourful phrase. On occasion he says things which, in the cold light of day, he may regret and see as verbal gargoyles decorating his argument but obscuring the kernel of his thought.<br><br>
The quotations which I am about to give are very good. They are measured and considered. The Solicitor-General at that stage was debating an amendment tabled by the Scottish National Party Member on that Committee, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), who was worried about the fact that in the caution which would be administered before an explanation could be asked for there was no statement that nothing need be said, The hon. and learned Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the function of the police when investigating a crime to direct their endeavours to obtaining a confession from the suspect to be used as evidence against him at the trial."</p></blockquote>
At this point, I should make clear that he was quoting Lord Cooper, but quoting him with approval. He continued to quote:
<br><blockquote><p>"By our law self-incriminating statements when tendered in evidence at a criminal trial are always jealously examined from the standpoint of being assured as to their spontaneity".</p></blockquote>
The Solicitor-General then went on in his own words:
<br><blockquote><p>"That is still the law of Scotland, and it will remain the law of Scotland whatever form this statute may take …. I stress that it is important that a person should be warned at this very early stage that he need not give an explanation to a police officer".—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 38.]</p></blockquote>
It is significant that the Solicitor-General should make that point. He went on to elaborate, and this is the part on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
which I would particularly found my argument, because it is highly relevant to the amendment:
<br><blockquote><p>"At this stage, nobody has been charged with anything. They do not know whether it is mobbing and rioting, murder, pick-pocketing, spitting in the street or what it is—they have just a general vague view about something. Now, to ask somebody to give an explanation without warning, when he does not know even whether he may end up on a charge of murder or a charge of public nuisance, seems to me a pretty dangerous thing to bring in".—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 43.]</p></blockquote>
So the Solicitor-General's view was that it was not the job of the police to obtain the Crown case by questioning in the streets and that it would be an extremely dangerous thing to do if there was hot an adequate caution that made clear that the person concerned need not reply if he did not wish to.<br><br>
The arguments which were used by the Solicitor-General are extremely persuasive. I shall quote him once more, because when we have a good case being argued we ought to make sure that it is properly before the Committee, and the following sentence is pregnant with good sense:
<br><blockquote><p>"I suggest that we should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations, without warning that people need not give them at that stage."—[<i>Official Report. First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
That is my case in a sense, that we should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations, without that warning. But we have not got that warning. It is not in the Bill.<br><br>
I adopt the Solicitor-General's argument that it would be wrong to start collecting the Crown's case on the street in that way, and, in view of his totally unequivocal argument on exactly this point, I cannot understand why those safeguards have not been built into the Bill by the present Government.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General may say that he will accept my amendment No. 12, and that would certainly do something to reassure us. It might also, Mr. Gourlay, save you from listening to another speech from me when amendment No. 12 is reached, and that might be a more persuasive point for the Solicitor-General to consider. But whether he accepts amendment No. 12 or not, this provision allows a request for an explanation at the point where the offence is discovered, where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
there may be youths milling about, where there may be civil disturbance, where there may be policemen chasing witnesses and policemen chasing other suspects, in a situation of some chaos. This is an innovation in the statute that we could well do without.<br><br>
Clearly, on the argument of the Solicitor-General we ought to do without it unless there are further safeguards built in. But, rather than struggle to get the right wording for these safeguards, I suggest that the cleanest thing to do is to accept the logic of the two tiers which I described at the beginning: leave the power to demand a name and address—to which I have no objection, in terms of a suspect at least—and get rid of the power to ask for an explanation. If the Solicitor-General does that, his hands will be that much cleaner, his Bill will be that bit neater, and we shall not have to have a long debate on amendment No. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is little need to expand on the case that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has made. His case is irrefutable and has the advantage of being backed up by the words of the Solicitor-General himself when he was on the Opposition Benches.<br><br>
What I am anxious about is that this seems to start the chain not only of events affecting the suspect but the chain that runs through the Bill. It is part of the process of legalising that which was illegal before, which is one of the rationales of the Bill. In other words, it seeks to give a formal power now in situations in which previously the constable might have exercised it without that formal power. This has always seemed to me one of the dangerous thoughts lying behind the Bill.<br><br>
Second, it ties up with the other aspects. It ties up with the sanctions in relation to detention and it ties up with the judicial examination under clause 6.<br><br>
First and foremost, before agreeing to endorse this provision, we must ask what will happen to that explanation. This has not been made clear. Will the explanation be part of the chain which is called in aid to bring proof when it eventually goes to court? We have seen certain safeguards under clause 6, and we seek to bring in more safeguards, but there are no safeguards here.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
The second point is the circumstances in which this situation arises. My hon. Friend referred to hot pursuit, but it is certainly a situation in which no one is able very easily to give a rational and considered response to the police requests.<br><br>
Third, there is the question of the generality of this phrase that the constable
<br><blockquote><p>"may ask him for an explanation of the circumstances"</p></blockquote>
without any clear instruction to the constable that he must spell out precisely on what his suspicions rest. As it stands, this could invalidate anything that the suspect might say.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Again I call in aid the Solicitor-General, because the fourth point is the consequence of that. In the discussions on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill introduced by the last Labour Government, the Solicitor-General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall be tabling amendments to provide for a formal hearing before a magistrate or sheriff, at which an explanation may be asked for, but that is another matter."</p></blockquote>
He was recognising the difference between an explantion asked in general terms and in general comment from the constable in a street situation, in a hot situation, and that which can be made in a formal hearing of one kind or another. "That is another matter", he says,
<br><blockquote><p>"But where a police officer, who is, so to speak, on one side of the battle, makes allegations about explanations which a person subsequently denies, that does nothing for the cause of justice." [<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; col. 38.]</p></blockquote>
One of the arguments of those who oppose the general tenor of the Bill has been that, far from helping law and order, it can of itself help to destroy law and order. In that situation, when a man has been spoken to by the police in this way, potentially for detention, under suspicion, one cannot necessarily expect a rational and considered response from him. He may, on the contrary, give a quick, hurried and fearful response, not being clear what his rights are or what he is likely to be charged with. When that is then denied—as perhaps it should be denied—the law itself is brought into contempt. This is the beginning of the chain which can only damage the fabric of the law.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
The safest thing to do is to leave out altogether the phrase which my hon. Friend seeks to amend. The qualifying subsection, subsection (4), reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A constable shall inform a person, when making a requirement … under … paragraph (<i>a</i>)"</p></blockquote>
which is the one we are dealing with—
<br><blockquote><p>"of his suspicion and of the general nature of the offence".</p></blockquote>
No warning of any kind is given. Again, one of the main anxieties about the Bill is this lack of protection that comes of itself from the powers of detention, without the formal legal protection that is given under the formal apparatus of arrest in terms of redress, protection and, above all, warning.<br><br>
A general explanation, the general nature of the offence, is all that the constable has to give. This is a serious matter. I think that the whole detention scheme should be thrown out, but this is within it and it is an extremely serious matter. It should be rejected.<br><br>
Finally, it undoubtedly infringes upon the right to silence, and it infringes upon the right to silence in a situation where it is most important that a man should be warned of his right to silence. In other words, when it is a hot situation, an anxious and sudden situation, precisely at that point should this be avoided.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General, reading again his own words, will come on our side and accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed in some respects by some of what has been said by hon. Gentlemen. I thought that we were sitting in this Committee with a view to trying as best we could to give the police the necessary tools to do their job, accepting, of course, that what we do not want to do is introduce a situation that would desperately alienate the police from the bulk of the population who are law-abiding.<br><br>
I take the view that law-abiding citizens are responsible people who expect us to give the police the support and the tools to do their job. But the proposal before us is to remove the constable's opportunity to ask for an explanation of the circumstances which have given rise to his suspicions. That is not an unreasonable tool to give a policeman on duty, because he would not approach an individual unless he had some grounds for doing so.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
When he has grounds for doing so, it is not unreasonable that he would expect an explanation.<br><br>
Once the explanation has been given and received, in the majority of instances that will be the end of the matter because the reason given for being there will be perfectly valid. It may be that in some circumstances—this could apply to all of us—we may not wish to be seen in the particular place at that time, but it has nothing whatever to do with breaking the law. One could be apprehensive, and that I could understand. Nevertheless, I believe that the police should be able to ask for reasonable explanations, taking into account that the police understand that people are often anxious and apprehensive when talking to them. This is certainly true when motoring problems arise. The police understand this and take it into account, and I believe that they will do so in all circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not honestly believe that this debate is about whether the police have adequate powers to do the task that the nation expects of them. We shall come to those debates on later clauses.<br><br>
Amendment No. 9 asks for the deletion of line 26:
<br><blockquote><p>"notes any explanation proffered by the person."</p></blockquote>
I must make abundantly clear that he is not a witness but a person suspected of having committed an offence, because it concerns paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) and not, as I understand it, paragraph (<i>b</i>).<br><br>
The Solicitor-General will, no doubt, make the point that the wording of his clause is different from the wording of the clause in the Labour Government's Bill inasmuch as an amendment was moved by the Solicitor-General to that Bill to delete the word "shall" and substitute "may". The word "may" has been carried into this legislation and appears throughout clause 1.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General would be right to argue that "may" gives the police officer arriving on the scene of an incident a discretion one could well argue the police officer did not have with the word "shall" in the Labour Government's Bill. Nevertheless, when the Labour Government's Bill left the Committee it had the word
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"may" inserted by the will of the Committee, because the amendment was carried. So the Bill as it left the Committee gave the police the discretion.</p></blockquote>
At the beginning of our debate, it is important to place on the record that we are all realists and we know that eventually this piece of legislation in some shape or form will go on to the statute book. That could not be said of the last Bill that we debated, for a great number of unfortunate reasons. That being so, we are under an obligation now, of all times, to make absolutely sure, or as sure as we can possibly be, that the rights of the individual as well as the ability of the police to do their job are properly balanced.<br><br>
Our approach to this Bill as an official Opposition will be to seek to balance those rights. It is not our wish, nor has it ever been our wish—we are misrepresented if anyone suggests otherwise—that a person who commits a crime should not be apprehended, brought to trial and properly sentenced. We want that. It is in society's interest because, if that does not happen, society will break down.<br><br>
These amendments are about how best that can be achieved without alienating one section of society against the police. We must look at these amendments to clause 1 not only in relation to clause 2 but also in relation to other clauses, and clause 6 in particular, the important judicial examination clause. That judicial examination clause was not in the Labour Government's Bill, and, in a sense, what is being said in clause 1 is that the judicial examination itself should begin in the street. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"notes any explanation proffered by the person."</p></blockquote>
I have no objection to a policeman saying to someone that he finds in a shop door, when the alarm bell is ringing, "What are you doing here?", and if the person found in the shop door cannot give a satisfactory explanation I think we would all expect that the natural second stage would be for the police officer to take that person to the police station and that there would be further questioning at that stage.<br><br>
But I worry that in that kind of situation, or in any other situation where someone is found in rather suspicious circumstances that the police officer may ask him for an explanation—that is the first step—without telling him that he has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
the right to remain silent. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, this is in a hot situation. The suspect is panicking, it is a hot situation, and in any case the person concerned would not know, and even if he were advised that he had the right to remain silent I doubt in the immediacy of the moment that that would get through. Nevertheless the police officer would ask him what he was doing there without saying that he had the right to say "I don't want to say anything." Of course, if he said "I don't want to say anything" that would arouse any reasonable police officer's suspicions.<br><br>
What worries me is that one goes on from there, once a person has said why he or she is in that situation. The police officer says "I want a full explanation of why you are here", and he still does not administer a caution. There is no indication here that the police officer, before he says that he wants a full explanation, tells the person that he has a right to remain silent. Nor does he say to the accused or suspected person, according to the legislation we are now discussing, that any explanation may well be used in evidence and could be submitted as part of the Crown's case if a trial were to follow.<br><br>
The obligation on the police officer is to note
<br><blockquote><p>"any explanation proffered by the person".</p></blockquote>
I think that the Solicitor-General will want to tell the Committee what the standing of that kind of statement will be should proceedings in such a case be taken further. Will the statement that the clause says should be noted be admissible as part of the evidence led by the Crown?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), who is an advocate, is shaking his head. In the nicest possible way, may I say that I hope that the advocates on the Government side of the Committee—who have obviously been appointed to help those of us who are not lawyers, and people outside, to understand the Bill a little better—will take part in our debates? I hope that, as we go through the Bill, we shall not divide on party-political grounds. I hope that we shall not have a situation in which every vote taken in the Committee is 9 to 8, because that will not produce good law. The Solicitor-General knows, and every advocate on the Committee knows, that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
that kind of approach to the Bill will not produce good law. There may well be times when my hon. Friends and I are divided in votes on the Bill. Perhaps I should put up an early warning sign.<br><br>
There is a heavy responsibility on the advocates in the Committee to take part in our debates and to make sure that when the Bill goes to Report it will at least have a reasonable chance of being accepted by the people who will be affected by it, by everybody concerned. I hope that the advocates on the Committee will take that point in the spirit in which it is made.<br><br>
We are talking about the beginning of a whole series of processes in relation to someone who is found in suspicious circumstances in a place where an incident has taken place and police officers are on the scene.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I must tell the Solicitor-General that the noting of the statement proferred by the person concerned gives me cause for great concern. It was not in our Bill, as the Solicitor-General knows. I have already conceded that there is more flexibility through the removal of "shall" and the insertion of "may", but that flexibility seems to me to have been nullified by the inclusion of paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2). It is for that reason that I am particularly anxious that the Committee should agree that subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) should be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the speeches of Opposition hon. Members, and it seems to me that there is a divergence of opinion as to what the clause is trying to achieve. On the one hand, it could be said—and this is my understandingof theclause—that it is there to aid the police in investigating crime, in order to help them find what happened, to try to build up the picture that they eventually need for the apprehension and, if necessary, conviction of the person who has perpetrated the crime.<br><br>
Some hon. Members may remember from their childhood a policeman known as "PC Plod" who used to walk up to people and say, "'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, what's all this then?" In a sense, what is proposed in the clause is that the police must be enabled to find out at the time or near the time of the commission of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
crime as much as they can, because it aids them in the complete investigation and eventual prosecution of it.<br><br>
That is the one possible explanation, and it is the one which I take by reading it. The other one is the one which has been put forward by the Opposition—that the clause is in some way aiding the police to build the case which eventually will come before the courts.<br><br>
I find this difficult to understand. I listened with care to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but my understanding of the law is that, once suspicion has centred—and the clause actually talks about suspicion—and before a caution is given, the evidence would in all likelihood, unless it was spontaneous, be inadmissable under the normal rules of evidence. I shall be interested to hear what the Solicitor-General has to say on that point, because the question of what is admissible has been argued at length before the courts over the years.<br><br>
I am strengthened in this view because my understanding of the law is that the evidence would almost certainly be inadmissible if it were pursuant upon questions from the police. It seems to me, within the context of the clause, that this is precisely the sort of area where, if the police wished to use this evidence in court, they would undoubtedly give a caution at the earliest possible moment. Because the police are aware of the laws of evidence, the clause seems to me, therefore, to have within its very nature the safeguards about which the hon. Member for Garscadden was speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will come to the point about paragraph (<i>b</i>) in subsection (2). Can he explain his understanding of why the policeman is being placed under an obligation to note any explanation proffered by the person if—as I understand the hon. Gentleman's belief—any statement made, unless made spontaneously, would not be admissible as evidence? Does this not lead the hon. Gentleman to believe that subsection 2(<i>b</i>) is indeed a dangerous paragraph to have in and that it ought to be removed? Obviously, there will be great debates in court about whether the statement made at the time of the incident is admissible.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, it is perhaps for my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General to explain this, but I can certainly give the Committee my understanding. The hon. Gentleman has stressed that the word "may" is in this part; it is descretionary. Where the policeman decides, in his discretion, to note down what an accused person has said, it is obviously in his interest to have that person stay with him while he does so. But I can see no way in which that subsection enables evidence which is inadmissible to become admissible.<br><br>
Let us suppose that the policeman has cautioned somebody, has told him that anything he says will be written down and may be used in evidence against him. He then has the right, under this clause, to make sure that the person remains there while he notes down what has been said.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, the policeman failed to give the caution and he noted down what was said, when he came before the court, if the prosecution produced this as evidence, I should object to it if I were defence counsel, on the basis of its inadmissibility because it was taken without caution after suspicion had arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. It would be useful to discover what the law is at present before we criticise any imagined changes in the law which the clause brings about.<br><br>
I say at the outset that the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. I do not want to anticipate the next debate, but it would be useful if I were to outline the present law, because it is relevant to both—though it is more relevant to the following debate.<br><br>
The law was set out in principle by Lord Cooper in the case of HM Advocate v. Chalmers. What he said about the concept of suspicion—I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) to listen carefully to this passage—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that my hon. Friend was wrong. I merely invited him to listen to the authority of a dead judge. Dead judges have more authority than living ones, as indeed have dead legal writers. That is

something which all lawyers look forward to with particular relish. I dare say that that view is shared by people who are not lawyers. Lord Cooper said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The theory of our law is that at the stage of initial investigation the police may question anyone with a view to acquiring information which may lead to the detection of the criminal"—</p></blockquote>
that is a right in common law—
<br><blockquote><p>"but that, when the stage has been reached at which suspicion, or more than suspicion, has in their view centred upon some person as the likely perpetrator of the crime, further interrogation of that person becomes very dangerous, and, if carried too far, e.g., to the point of extracting a confession by what amounts to cross-examination, the evidence of that confession will almost certainly be excluded".</p></blockquote>
There is, however, a necessity to appreciate that the word "suspicion", in the sense in which Lord Cooper was using it, rested upon suspicion of a particular crime. There are quite different circumstances which are covered by the case of Costello v. Macpherson in 1922 Justiciary Cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Solicitor-General give us the reference for the quotation which he has just read?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is from HM Advocate v. Chalmers, 1954 Justiciary Cases. I happen to have it on page 29 of volume 2 of the Thomson Report, where it is quoted. But Chalmers is to be found in the 1954 Justiciary Cases-—or was, when I last looked at it.<br><br>
What I have described is the other form of suspicion. One form of suspicion is thinking, for example, that someone is Lord Lucan or someone wanted on a warrant for a particular offence. Another form of suspicion may merely arise from circumstances which may or may not be innocent. That is the form that Costello deals with.<br><br>
A railway employee was convicted in a police court of stealing coal from a coal bunker. The evidence laid was to the following effect. At 5 am two railway policemen found the accused carrying a paper parcel near a house where there was a coal bunker belonging to the railway company. The police asked what was in the parcel and the accused replied "Old paper".<br><br>
I pause here to answer a point made by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), who said that this sub-section referred only to:
<br><blockquote><p>"the general nature of the offence".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
It is obvious that in circumstances where someone is found carrying a parcel at five o'clock in the morning, on property which is not his, one cannot say to him "Excuse me, I think you have stolen some coal", because at that stage one does not know what is in the parcel. It might have been old paper.<br><br>
The police then asked to see the contents of the parcel, which when opened was found to contain a piece of coal. The police asked the accused where he had got the coal and he replied that he had got it from a miner. A sergeant of the regular police then came up and requested the accused and the policeman to go into the police office. On the way to the police office the accused said "To save trouble I may as well tell you the truth. I took the coal from the bunker." Up to that time no charge had been made against him and no warning had been given to him.<br><br>
In the course of the trial an objection to the admissibility of the evidence as to the statement made by the accused was repelled. I take it that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South must have been appearing for this unfortunate gentleman. The judgment makes the following statement. It was the Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Scott Dickson, at page 11;
<br><blockquote><p>"The admissibility of these statements was questioned by the accused. The first two statements were made at a time when there was no charge at all".</p></blockquote>
in the circumstances of this clause.<br><br>
Only the general nature of what the police were on about, if that is the way to put it, would be known to the accused. He would know, because he had the parcel; but they did not know. So he was in a better state of knowledge than they were.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"The first two statements were made at a time when there was no charge at all and the police in the ordinary course of their duty, having had their suspicions aroused, asked the man what he was carrying. This I think they were entitled to do, because if policemen are not entitled to make inquiries when they believe (and nobody can say that the circumstances here were not suspicious) that a crime has been committed, the due discharge of their duties would be seriously hampered. Now I have no doubt that, when a person has been charged, he cannot be questioned by the police without being duly cautioned that he is not bound to answer, and that anything he says may be used in evidence against him. The position might have been different if the police had cross-questioned him on the point."</p></blockquote>
There one has a situation—and there will be multiple such situations—where a person is found in what may be a perfectly

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
innocent situation. He may be found carrying a heavy suitcase in the early hours of the morning in a place in which one cannot imagine that somebody would be flitting at that time, and the policeman may ask "What is in that suitcase?" There is the added caution that this clause provides, that the person has to be advised of the general nature of the inquiry, and if the amendment were accepted it would lead to absurd situations.<br><br>
First, any policeman who saw a railway porter carrying a parcel at five o'clock in the morning would have to ask him his name and address only—"What is your name?"—and the man would have said "My name is Costello". He asks him nothing else. In order to ask him what is in the parcel he then has to detain him and use the powers of clause 2. That would be the effect if this amendment were accepted, and that is absurd. There is a common law right of a policeman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Solicitor-General really arguing that because there is not a statutory entitlement to do something, it is impossible to use the powers under common law which he has been so eloquently defending in terms of the Costello judgment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying is that if he was using powers under this clause he would have to do what I suggested, and that is nonsensical and foolish.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I want to correct something which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said. He said that in this Committee we are trying to balance the rights of the individual and the rights of the police to carry out their duty. With great respect, that is not the balance. The police are not an entity on their own. We are trying to balance the rights of all the individuals in society as protected by the police against the rights of those who offend against all the other individuals in society. That is the balance.<br><br>
With great respect, the police have a general right to ask questions of anybody if they have suspicions. For instance, they may think that a certain individual has committed some crime. They ask him what his name and address is, and if he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
confirms that he is Mr. Whoever-it-is, they can take the matter further. It is very important that the general power of the police to ask a persons's name and address and for an explanation of the circumstances should be made clear in this statute. It is important. It is necessary and it is inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. and learned Gentleman indicate whether he is of a mind, particularly in view of the quotations from his past speeches, to accept amendment No. 12?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not disposed to accept amendment No. 12, for the very good reason that I read my speeches with more care than perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), thought I must say that to have an encomium such as he poured upon me in praise of my eloquence gives me almost Demosthenic fantasies. But if the hon. Gentleman puts the matter in context, he will remember that this was related to an amendment by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), if I recall it aright, to further advise a person that while he is under-no obligation to give an explanation under paragraph (<i>a</i>), if he fails to do so he may be required by the constable to accompany him to a police station or other premises in terms of clause 2. That is the amendment that was being discussed, and that amendment was withdrawn. But I made no suggestion, nor would I have made a suggestion, in any of those remarks that the caution should be a statutory caution. The circumstances and the time at which a caution is administered are very important. But clearly, one does not go up to somebody and say "You need say nothing, anything you do say will be noted, but what is in that parcel?" That is not how the police operate or ought to operate, and it is not the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to anticipate the debate on amendment No. 12, which we shall certainly come to. But as the Solicitor-General has taken this line, perhaps I may put it to him that if he looks at column 39, it is quite clear that what he is doing, quite rightly in my view, is objecting to the alternative in that amendment moved by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)—that if a per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
son does not give an explanation, he may be taken to a police station under clause 2. Everyone except the mover agreed that that was a very bad alternative threat built into the amendment. But whole gravamen of the hon. and learned Member's argument was that despite that, he agreed that there was real cause for anxiety about the lack of a warning that a person need say nothing.<br><br>
I give one quotation:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think that the power of detention, the alternative given under the amendment"—</p></blockquote>
that is the power to use clause 2—
<br><blockquote><p>"is wrong, but I think it important to give the warning that an explanation need not be given to the constable. Let us remember that it will be only one constable; it will not be corroborated. It may be, but it will probably not be corroborated, and that would not be sufficient evidence that the statement, if challenged, had been given.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I suggest that that must be taken into consideration. I suggest that we should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations, without warning that people need not give them at that stage."—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.39–40.]</p></blockquote>
—I could go on quoting at length. It is as clear as a pikestaff.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman may say that he has changed his mind. He may say that he was wrong. But to say that he did not say these things borders on the misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see that the tributes are falling in scale very fast. If the hon. Gentleman will read that passage again he will see that it is only at a stage when suspicion had fallen in the proper sense of the word that it would become what eventually will be the Crown's case. Before suspicion has arisen there will be multiple circumstances as to the level of suspicion, the cause of suspicion, whether it is a suspicion that that person may be, shall we say, the legendary Donnie or whoever. It may be a suspicion that the person has—dare I say it?—an offensive weapon on him. If the hon. Member knows his law, as I am sure he does, he will know that there are innumerable statutes which give power to persons to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we may also ask the hon. and learned Gentleman directly and simply to explain what is meant by saying
<br><blockquote><p>"I suggest that we should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
without warning that people need not give them at that stage."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
This is clear, comprehensive and, I would have thought, true. I wish he would either tell us whether he has changed his mind—and if so, why—or accept that this was his view when in opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not changed my mind on the matter at all. The police know the law and they know that they will imperil any explanation if they ask for it in circumstances in which suspicion has so firmly focused that they are really inviting a person then to add to the evidence. That is exactly what the law is. It is what the law always has been, and it is what the law will continue, I imagine, to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman answer the question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are innumerable statutes. For instance, under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 there are provisions for a policeman to ask a person for an explanation if he finds him in a particular place. Section 409 of that Act says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every known or reputed thief, … or who is found in possession of any money or article without being able to give a satisfactory account of his possession."</p></blockquote>
Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every person committing any of the offences herein-before mentioned"—</p></blockquote>
and who is
<br><blockquote><p>"in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or waggon, … and not giving a good account of himself or herself."</p></blockquote>
Under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 a constable can ask a person "Why have you got this horse and cart when the horse is not properly fed?" There are many statutory provisions for asking for explanations without mention of caution. It will always depend, in the whole circumstances, as to the level and form of the suspicion. That is the important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend, both for the law lesson and for coming round eventually to the same understanding of the law as I tried to give in my remarks earlier. My question is this. Does he not think that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
if a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed a crime—rather than that he is committing it—in those circumstances suspicion has in fact crystallised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends very much on the circumstances. For instance, if it is widely believed that somebody called George Dart is the person who broke into the Bank of Scotland and stole £10,000, there is no question but that the policeman has formed a confidence that George Dart broke into a bank. He comes upon a person, he is not sure who he is and asks "Who are you? I want your name and address." The man says "I am John Dart". The policeman still has the same amount of suspicion. If the man says "I am actually George Dart", his suspicion has been fully confirmed.<br><br>
Until the suspicion is confirmed a different situation exists. There may be a much higher level of suspicion before it is confirmed. For instance, in Costello, if the railway porter had opened the suitcase and it had contained four manuals of signals practice which had been issued to him, the suspicion would have been ill-founded and there never really would have been any suspicion, although suspicion there was. So what we mean by "suspicion"—and I confirm this and say it again—is that if one has reached a stage at which one is satisfied that a crime has been committed, and one is right, and the person has committed it, one has reached a stage when suspicion is fully there, and in those circumstances any explanation would have to be under caution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one has to wait until the point where one not only has suspicion but knows that one is right, it means that one has to wait until after the trial, which seems rather pointless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we were supposed not to be metaphysical this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point is that the Solicitor-General is making no gradations of suspicion, if all that the Bill says is "grounds for suspecting". How can the hon. and learned Gentleman then say that with larger grounds for suspicion one set
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
of actions is permissible, and with lower grounds of suspicion another set of actions is? This is not the definition in the law; he is inventing law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>:
What I am telling the hon. Gentleman—and I understand his confusion—is this, There are innumerable forms of suspicion. There are innumerable ways in which suspicion arises. The common law is—as I read from Chalmers and from Costello v. Macpherson—that the police will imperil any explanation given if it is asked for in circumstances in which the person concerned is the suspect for the crime.<br><br>
That is what the law is. It is quite clear. For instance, in the case of Costello the policemen did not know that a crime had been committed when he asked the question. He suspected that a crime might have been committed. The same thing could arise in the case of somebody carrying a heavy suitcase. Let us take the example of H.M. Advocate v. Howard Wilson. When Constable McAllister and Inspector Hislop crossed the road to see Howard Wilson carrying a heavy suitcase they had no reason to imagine for a moment that he would be the man who had robbed four banks. He was an ex-policeman. But they thought it suspicious that so heavy a suitcase was being carried into a house in Allison Street, opposite the Southern police office, in the middle of the afternoon. In fact their suspicion turned out to be accurate, and they paid with their lives for it.<br><br>
Although that was a fundamentally accurate suspicion, as subsequent events tragically proved, it does not alter the fact that that is one form of suspicion. If on the other hand the police had had information that the person who had robbed the various banks was an ex-Glasgow policeman, and they had seen Howard Wilson and said to themselves "I wonder if that might be him", and asked him "Are you Howard Wilson?", that would have been a quite different form of suspicion. So there is no way in which one can categorise suspicion.<br><br>
All one can say is that it is the law that where a suspicion centres on one person having committed a particular crime, to obtain explanations or statements without caution may render them inadmissible. That is the law. It cannot be fitted into any other than a general principle,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
because every case, every level of suspicion and every circumstances will always differ.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the hon. and learned Gentleman's definition, he is accepting that subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) falls into precisely that category. If so, is he telling us that anything said at that point, any explanation offered, will not be used at any later time in preparing a case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not at all. With respect, the hon. Gentleman did not listen. For instance, if when they had said to Howard Wilson, "What is in that suitcase?", he had said "As a matter of fact, old chap, you will not believe it, but it is all copper and silver from the Royal Bank which I robbed this morning", on the hon. Gentleman's proposition that would not be admissible. But that is perfectly admissible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the Government's proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is the hon. Gentleman's proposition. I said that suspicion varies. It may be open suspicion. It may be circumstantial suspicion. It may be suspicion that a person is someone who he may or may not be. It may be suspicion that a person is carrying something which is innocently or guiltily carried. In fact, one may say to someone "What is in that parcel?" and he may open it and shoot one with a gun. There are innumerable circumstances. It is only in law—and I hope that I state the law correctly—when suspicion has centred on a single named individual for committing a single known crime, that to obtain any explanation, to ask any question, without the protection and safeguard of a caution may render it inadmissible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General in his reply must have seriously worried some of his hon. and learned Friends, because the hon. and learned Gentleman was very confused at times in dealing with the points that were made during the debate. The Solicitor-General did not address himself once to where the idea came from to include in this legislation clause 1(2)(<i>b</i>)—the standing of the statements that the police officer would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
record if they were "proffered by the person". The fact that that phrase has been used—"proffered by the person"—certainly conveys to me the impression that it would be a voluntary statement. As I understand the law, a voluntary statement would be admissible and be used in evidence against that person if that person were to be brought to court. It is important, for the benefit of the Committee, that we understand the standing of the statements or the explanations that are to be recorded by the police officer.<br><br>
The words used in clause 1(2)(<i>b</i>) are quite specific:
<br><blockquote><p>"notes any explanation proffered by the person".</p></blockquote>
Lord Justice-Clerk Thomson—again, page 29 of the Thomson report said:
<br><blockquote><p>"there comes a point of time in ordinary police investigation when the law intervenes to render inadmissible as evidence answers even to questions which are not tainted by [bullying, pressure, third degree methods and so forth]. After the point is reached, further interrogation is incompatible with the answers being regarded as a voluntary statement".</p></blockquote>
We must clear up the position about these statements, these explanations, which are referred to. I take it that the word "explanation" means the same as "statement". There is no difference between us that the word "explanation" does not mean anything else except a statement. If that is accepted, the word "proffered" certainly means "volunteered".<br><br>
Therefore, we are talking about the policeman noting a voluntary statement made by the suspected person. Lord Justice-Clerk Thomson is obviously accurate in his recording of the situation as he sees it on page 29 of the Thomson report.<br><br>
If that is accurate, there can surely be no doubt that the statements noted by the police officer will be admissible and will be used in evidence.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will clear up these three points. First, why has it been felt necessary to include this proposition in the Bill? What is its purpose? Where did the idea come from? It is certainly not in the Thomson report, and I am not aware of anyone having asked for this proposition to be included.<br><br>
Secondly, what is the standing of the statements that are to be recorded by the police officer? My interpretation—I hope that the Solicitor-General will tell me if I am wrong—is that these are voluntary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
statements and that they will be used in evidence.<br><br>
If that is the position, it leads me to my third point: that these voluntary statements will have been made in a hot situation, has been said almost within half an hour or 45 minutes of the police arriving on the scene of a suspected offence. It presents a situation which is not only complicated, but dangerous. It will provide the lawyers—I am sure they are turning it over in their minds at the moment—with a field day if these cases come to court. There will be great, long, harangues in the courts whether that statement was voluntary or whether, as Thomsom says, it was obtained through
<br><blockquote><p>"bullying, pressure, third degree methods and so forth."</p></blockquote>
We know that there will be a host of cases in which the preliminary proceedings will be almost entirely taken up in deciding whether the statement was voluntary or obtained by the methods suggested by Thomson. But if the court turns to the legislation, it will have no option but to rule that the statements are voluntary. I hope that the Solicitor-General will clear up these points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It had not been my intention to speak on this amendment until I listened to the Solicitor-General's explanation why he had changed his mind and grounds. His last two or three sentences horrified me. He appeared to be suggesting—he will correct me if I am wrong—that if a policemen has cause to suspect a person of a particular crime and he questions him, he will have to caution him. But if he stops the person on general grounds just because he suspects that he might commit a crime, he will not have to caution him. Am I right in that assumption?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solictor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That seems to give the police a wide power and to limit severely the civil rights of people. If one has actually committed a crime and the police have good reason to suspect one of a particular crime and one is stopped in the street and questioned by the police, one is entitled to a caution.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
Let us suppose that I am walking home over Westminster Bridge and through a part of London which is not particularly salubrious at, say three o'clock on a wet, hot morning. I have undone my tie, I have an anorak on because it is wet, and my collar is turned up. I may be teetering along because it is wet. My demeanour may look suspicious because I have my collar up and I am trying to hide my face. My mode of dress may look slightly suspect in that I have an anorak on and I do not have a tie. The time of observation is three in the morning—a time when the police suspect a person who is walking the streets, particularly if he happens to be a carrying a case.<br><br>
If I were in Glasgow, not in London, I could be stopped by the police, questioned and asked to open my briefcase without any caution being given to me about my rights in terms of answering questions. That is totally unacceptable and is very much against what the Thomson report said. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had continued to read the chapter to its conclusions, instead of just the preamble to its conclusions, he would have read in paragraph 7.12:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are satisfied that whatever the state of the law the police do question and will continue to question suspects. It is only reasonable that an investigator should ask questions of persons who, he thinks, might be concerned in the subject of his investigation…".</p></blockquote>
The reference is to someone "who, he thinks, might be concerned". It is not a hard suspicion, not an absolute suspicion; it is just "might be concerned". He is not even necessarily suspecting him actually of the crime; he might be concerned in the subject of his investigation. The passage continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"the more he suspects a particular person the more he will question him…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There is in our view nothing improper in the police asking questions, checking the answers"</p></blockquote>
but
<br><blockquote><p>"we recommend in paragraph 7.13<i>b</i> that the suspect should be cautioned before such interrogation, and it would not be fair to found upon his refusal to answer questions which he has been told he need not answer."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 7.13<i>b</i> goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before being questioned the suspect must have been cautioned. The caution should be in the following terms:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'You are going to be asked questions about [brief description of the crime]. You are not bound to answer but, if you do, your answers will be noted and may be used in evidence. Do you understand?'"</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
It seems to me that the hon. and learned Gentleman has turned on his head in terms of his own speeches during the previous debates on a Bill of similar nature, but the founding of so much of the first part of the present Bill is upon the second report of the Thomson committee. Yet, when the Thomson committee is at least insisting on safeguards being built into these new procedures that the Government are introducing, the Solicitor-General is denying them and saying that he is not prepared to accept reasonable amendments put forward from our side.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General has tended to base his whole case on this in terms of serious crime. He has used examples where there was robbery of some form in the first case. The Costello case was perhaps a rather minor crime, but still robbery. He has also used examples on the basis of murder, bank robbery and so on.<br><br>
But clause 1 not deal with serious crime, as clause 2 does. When we get to the detention clauses, it is clear that we are talking about offences which have imprisonment as a sentence. But clause 1 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence at any place…".</p></blockquote>
An offence, not a serious crime necessarily. It can be a motoring offence or quite minor offences of various natures. In that sense, it goes much wider in this type of stopping and questioning than would be the case if we were dealing with serious crime. Therefore, I am happy to support my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with a great interest to the Solicitor-General's speech. It seemed to me that he was floundering about with an extremely bad brief and that he not only stood on his head but drove himself into the ground like a tent peg and waved his legs in the air.<br><br>
I do not know whether he was trying to discourage his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) when he savaged him on the basis of his error in law. I thought it rather uncharitable, because everyone is allowed an honest error as a professional man. In any case, it turned out that it was not an error at all because, whether he realised it or not, the Solicitor-General ended up marching buttock to buttock and cheek by jowl with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South within a handful of paragraphs. It was a piece of intellectual flexibility which was at times breathtaking.<br><br>
I assure the Solicitor-General that, if he thinks that his remarks on the law of admissibility of evidence will get him some sort of legal form of life after death, he is probably in for a great disappointment.<br><br>
The point which has arisen about the admissibility of any explanation that is offered is of great importance. I was fascinated by the remarks of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South about the need to have suspicion crystallised, and after that point any admissible evidence had to be totally spontaneous. It is exactly the kind of argument that I used, which was greeted with scorn by Conservative spokesmen. I hope that he will consider his position—I mean this seriously—in terms of clause 2, because I think that I am about to have an unlikely but extremely welcome ally in the chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party when we reach that part of our debate.<br><br>
I do not want to discourage the hon. Gentleman in his zeal and ardour, but it may be that H.M. Advocate v. Chalmers has been disinterred for expediency purposes by Conservative speakers too early in this debate. I may have to say a word of caution and recall that we have had other judgments. Constantly on the lips of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South is the name "Hartley". He constantly draws my attention to H.M. Advocate v. Hartley and a number of other judgments of more recent date where the test that has been applied is fairness, and where we have got away from the rather more rigid Chalmers three stages of no suspicion, crystallised suspicion and post-charging. It may be that we are in a more flexible situation, and it is in that position that it seems to me that to leave the clause in its present state is rather dangerous.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Great ingenuity has been shown in distinguishing between types of suspicion. I accept that there are different types of suspicion. But if anyone suggests that this is suspicion of a low definition which we can treat a little cavalierly and therefore there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
is no need for anxiety or for cautions of any kind, I must disagree. The suspicion here is that
<br><blockquote><p>"A constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence".</p></blockquote>
This is not the situation that the hon. and learned Gentleman was positing, a Costello situation, where there is no knowledge in the mind of the constable that there has been an offence, there are merely general circumstances which make him think that perhaps an offence has been committed and, if he pushes his investigations to a certain point, all may be revealed. That is not the situation here. Here the constable must have reasonable suspicion that a specific person has committed an offence.<br><br>
The most likely situation, the classic case in which, presumably, the Solicitor-General envisages this clause being used, is when, let us say, there is a breach of the peace in the street and the constable actually sees it being committed and comes along and says "Right. I want you. What is your name and address, why are you here, and what are you doing?" Or when he comes along, for example, and finds that the security of a shop has been breached; he hears glass breaking, he comes round the corner in a great hurry and finds the glass door of a shop has been broken and within a few yards of it, trying to look innocent, he finds A. N. Other. He grabs A. N. Other and says "I think you broke into that shop. What is your name and what is your explanation?"<br><br>
At that stage there is a high degree of suspicion. There are certainly reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed. But it also takes us into a situation where, it seems to me, there is a great deal of well-formed suspicion. We are late in the process of forming suspicion and converting it into a chargeable offence, and that will be often the situation in the use of this clause.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it seems to me extremely dangerous to say that there is no need for a caution, that there is no need to warn a person that he need say nothing. Despite the faith in the judiciary which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South expresses, and despite the fact that this is not a Costello situation where it was a totally spontaneous blurted-out confession but was in fact in reply to a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
question, I suspect that there is grave danger that the courts, in applying the kind of Hartley test of fairness would say that this is admissible.<br><br>
If there is that possibility, not in every case but in the kind of cases where the clause could be used which I have described, it seems to me vital that we have the safeguards in and that at least we have a proper caution.<br><br>
I feel that the debate has thrown up a great deal of confusion and doubt in the minds of hon. Members. I make no exception of the Solicitor-General. I thought that his mind was as confused as clouded as any. I can only suggest that it was possibly the aftermath of a Demosthenic fantasy, but it seemed to me that he was confused. In those circumstances, it would be very much better to leave this provision out altogether. That seems to be the safest and most sensible thing.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General said that that would have undesired consequences because, if we left it merely that the constable would have power to require that a person give his name and address, and go no further, that would be some sort of truncated provision and it would preclude the kind of normal inquiry which a police constable might make.<br><br>
I do not see that at all. Of course, that inquiry, because of the state of suspicion that had been formed at that time, might be open to challenge in the courts. But if there is, on the analogy of Costello, which was argued at such length by the Solicitor-General, a common law right—those were the terms in which he defended the substitution for that common law right of a statutory right—it does not preclude that common law right, but it is not enshrined in statute.<br><br>
To say that there is an absurd consequence, that suddenly the police cannot do things which they can do at common law, if the Solicitor-General is right, and they will be precluded from doing so because we take this out of the Bill is self-evidently nonsense. To suggest that it would have what he described as the absurd consequences is inaccurate. The absurdity is his argument and not the consequences which he saw. To go back for precedents to the Vagrancy Act 1824, which is in disrepute in the mind of every practitioner in the courts, to burrow through what he described as innumerable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
statutes and come up with some very bad and inexact nineteenth-century precedents, does nothing to bolster his case.<br><br>
Subject to any last-minute change of mind by the Solicitor-General, we ought to push this matter to a Division. It is of some importance. The attitude of the Government side is disappointing. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said that we should try to give the police the tools they wanted. His only caveat was about desperately alienating the police from the bulk of the public. That is a dangerous and widely drawn caveat. We have a duty in the law to protect the entire public, and we have a duty to have fairness in the law.<br><br>
It is not, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, a matter of the police asking for a reasonable explanation. They merely ask for an explanation; it has nothing to do with being reasonable or otherwise. It has certainly nothing to do with motoring offences when the hon. Gentleman is hurrying to a constituency surgery up the A9. But it has a lot to do with the rights of the police in a hot pursuit, where there may be a multiple breach of the peace, assaults, or people milling about.<br><br>
If the Solicitor-General is right that the common law power exists, there is no particular advantage in enshrining it in statute. It merely makes it rigid. It is unnecessary. If it is an extension beyond the common law power, it is a dangerous one. On either argument, we should be better without these additional words in the Bill. Let us leave it purely and simply on the basis that the police have a right to require a name and address. It is neater, simpler and safer. As the Conservative Government are committed to cutting down the amount of legislation that we have to consider, it seems to me on every ground to be convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>:
May I briefly reply to the debate. I do not know why the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr Dewer) is getting so worked up. This was, of course, in the Labour Bill, and he had a full year in which to make comments on that. We are always being told that we must have more time to consider these matters. I have seen no comment from him that that was a bad or undesirable provision or superfluous to the common law. His argument was facile.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
The hon. Gentleman should know, as a matter of interpretation, that where there is a statutory provision which runs in harness or in parallel with the common law provision, and where the statutory provision is restricted, it may, as a matter of interpretation, be presumed that the common law is thereby restricted. I said that it "may" be presumed. That is why it is essential that the statute provides that in exercising the power to ask for the name and address, a constable is allowed to ask for an explanation, because otherwise one would get the situation—the hon. Member for Garscadden gave the example—of a constable hearing breaking glass, rushing round a corner, finding a shop door had been kicked in, seeing somebody standing there looking innocent, and then, having asked his name and address by statute, reverting to a common law request for an explanation as to why he kicked the door in. That would be very unsatisfactory, and therefore the provision should be left as it is.<br><br>
I have an apology to make to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I meant to answer the point he raised. The reason for noting any explanation proffered is that it is an additional safeguard. I do not know what was in the mind of the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth as to what would happen under his Bill. One was entitled to ask for an explanation, and presumably one was just supposed to remember it. If a person said "As a matter of fact, I have just come from Sauchiehall Street, I am going to see Grannie, then I'm on my way, and yesterday my mother died", obviously he would not remember all that, so it must be noted. Therefore the person has to remain with him until it has been noted and confirmed, and that is the reason for subsection (2)(<i>b</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, it is much simpler than that. A policeman investigating a suspected offence asks someone why he is there, and if he is not satisfied with the explanation he will implement the next stage of the procedure and take the person to the police station for questioning. What the Solicitor-General is saying is that that statement has to be recorded. I hope that he will tell us the standing of these statements.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman that, but first, if I may correct him, let us take, for example, the Costello situation. The policeman received the explanation that the man had got the coal from a miner, and he names him as Mr. George Eadie of 14 Glebe Road. He accepts that explanation and says "All right, thank you very much". He lets the chap go. Then he goes along to Mr. George Eadie and says "Did you give some coal to Mr. Costello?" George Eadie says "I have never heard of him in my life, and I have never touched a piece of coal in my life." In those circumstances the matter would proceed from there, but the fact that one gets an answer which may in the end turn out to be a suspicious or false answer is not the reason for arresting the person or charging him at that time.<br><br>
Now let me come to the status of these statements. The status of these statements is exactly the same as any oral evidence in law. If it falls outside the safeguards of Chalmers, it either will be or may be inadmissible. If, for instance, one was to find somebody with an object which it would be extremely unlikely for a person to have—such as a handful of diamonds in the street at 3 o'clock in the morning in the circumstances indicated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—I should have throught that a caution would be appropriate, and to say to the person "Excuse me, where did you get these pretty stones?" without a caution might threaten the admissibility of that evidence. I do not say that it would threaten but it might threaten it. But the question whether a statement is admissible or is not admissible entirely depends on case law as to whether it was fair to the accused to obtain the statement in the circumstances, with caution or without caution, with question or without question. That is the test.<br><br>
Cases are so different and so general that all one can say is this. One of the reasons, I think, why a lot of Opposition Members are confused with concepts of civil liberty is that, like the hon. Member for Cathcart, they have no idea what the law of Scotland is. But the law of Scotland is exactly as he pronounced it, that if one is walking along in the circumstances he described, such as might give rise to the suspicion that one is carrying stolen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
property, a police officer can come up and say "What is in your briefcase?" If one fails to give an explanation, gives a false explanation, or gives an explanation and it turns out that what is in it is stolen, one can be arrested.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
But if it is without caution a police officer can come up and say "You are not John Maxton, are you?" If one says "Yes", he can arrest one on the spot for a crime he understands one is supposed to have committed. It is on his file in the station. He does not have to say "I caution you not to say you are John Maxton, but are you John Maxton?" He can just ask.<br><br>
As I have tried to explain as simply as I can, the circumstances in which suspicion arises vary over an immense spectrum. The court will judge in any case whether a statement obtained was fairly obtained. If it was not fairly obtained it is inadmissible, whether it be under clause 1 or under any other provision of the law. If it was fairly obtained it will be admissible. I do not want to go into the whole of the law of evidence on statements, but I can assure the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth that the law of admissibility of oral evidence is not changed at all by clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the failure to say anything in explanation? Can that be used in these circumstances where there is no caution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us take the Costello case as an example. If Costello had said nothing, I suppose there would have been no evidence because, as the case reads, nobody identified the coal as coming from any particular place. If, on the other hand, we take the example of the constable asking "Are you John Maxton?" and the answer was "I'm not telling you" or "I have no name" or "I am Bing Crosby" or "Father Christmas", I think that the police officer would be likely in those circumstances to detain one in order to confirm his suspicions or otherwise. If it later turned out that one was John Maxton and had therefore attempted to disguise one's identity from a policeman, it might be used as an adminicle of evidence in some case in which, for instance, one disputed the fact
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
that one was a deserter from the army. The denial of one's true identity might be an adminicle of evidence.<br><br>
There are all sorts of circumstances, but the safeguard of the law which applies in this clause, as it does to all charges, is that if the circumstances in which an explanation is obtained or the method by which an explanation is obtained—I restrict myself for the moment purely to those obtained under this clause—is unfair, in other words, if it was clear, for instance, that the policeman knew that one was John Maxton, he knew that one was supposed to have robbed the Bank of Scotland, and without telling one he said "I suppose you have a great deal of money these days", and one said "Yes, I am very well off now", and that was to be used in evidence, then, indeed, that might be</span></p>

<p>I hope that I have answered the questions of all hon. Members. I thank those who have contributed to the debate. May I say, finally, that I am delighted to know that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has been able to explain the law of admissibility so that even the hon. Member for Garscadden can understand it.</p>

<p>No. 15, in page 2, line 30, leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>).</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simplest thing about amendment No. 3 is understanding its effect. It is simply to remove the power to require a witness to an offence or a suspected offence to give his name and address. The position at the moment is that the Bill allows a constable who has reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence to require any other person whom he believes has information relating to the offence to give his name and address.<br><br>
Originally, as members of the Committee will recognise, there was a much more sweeping power because, if that person gave his name and address, he could be detained while it was verified. But, thanks to the admirable activities in another place, Ministers have been driven
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
in full retreat on that point and they are not proposing to reintroduce it. So the only power left is that requiring the giving of name and address.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should try to get his facts right, even if he cannot get his law right. It was a Government amendment in another place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a piece of sophistry. It was indeed a Government amendment, but it was a Government amendment that was brought about in response to a revolt in the other place, and a guarantee that they would implement changes. On that basis, the original—presumably, faultily drafted—amendments were withdrawn. So it is not fair to suggest that it was a spontaneous recantation. It was, I am afraid, forced upon the Government.<br><br>
However, the main point is that we are now trying to take the power to require a name and address from witnesses out of the Bill. I do this with some nervousness, because I recognise that it will be immediately open to misinterpretation. It is not so much the flamboyant attacks of the Solicitor-General for Scotland that worry me but the rather more insidious suggestions from other members of the Committee, particularly from the Under-Secretary of State. His activities remind me of those of an undertaker speaking ill of the dear departed. They have a veneer of respectability. I fear that it may be suggested that in some way we are soft on law and order and against the police. That is not the position. I want to make clear—certainly for myself, and I am sure that I speak for all my hon. Friends—that we are not attacking the concept that witnesses or potential witnesses should cooperate fully with the police whenever possible.<br><br>
For example, if one sees some incident and the police ask for one's name and address, it is clearly one's moral duty as a citizen to co-operate and give every possible assistance to the police. No one on these Opposition Benches would dissent from that.<br><br>
The point which arises, however, is whether a moral duty should on every occasion be translated into a legal duty carrying a penalty. That is what is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
attempted in the clause. In a sense, we are being asked to bring in further compulsory powers. It is strange that it is a Conservative Government who are insisting on these compulsory powers and the Opposition who are suggesting that we still live in a society where moral duty should be voluntarily undertaken and not necessarily be enforced by the criminal law.<br><br>
I hear my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) make <i>sotto voce</i> the important correction that it is perhaps not surprising, and I take that point. There is a common misconception that in some way the Conservative Party is the party of individual liberty, whereas in fact it is not. Those who believe that within a proper framework which allows the exercise of free will and that free will should be defended are those on these Benches and in the Labour Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why, by "these Benches", as he puts it—which presumably includes the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—this is regarded as a matter that should be one of free will? They had in their own Bill a requirement that a witness should give his name and address and that he could be detained with reasonable force until that name and address had been verified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair question. It is one that the hon. and learned Gentleman addressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). Let me make it clear. My hon. Friend has honourably made clear that there are differences of view on this side of the Committee. On this occasion, I think—I mean no disrespect to him—that I shall carry the majority of my colleagues with me. But he maintains a different emphasis. It is not often that I can say this, but I think that in this case he is mistaken in the emphasis he puts in the Bill. This is a Bill on which we should take an independent stand. It transcends narrow party politics. I can say that with some conviction because I voted, as the hon. and learned gentleman knows, against my Front Bench on numerous occasions during the last Committee. I hope that there will be people who, on occasion, will have the courage to follow private convictions and do likewise.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
But the generalisation I make is, I think, a good one. I believe that there is a higher sensitivity on the issue of private moral duty and the right of the individual to operate in society without compulsion in our party than there is in the Conservative Party generally. It should try your patience, Mr. Gourlay, and it would perhaps try the patience of hon. Members even more, were I to go into the respective philosophies of the parties, but it could be done effectively and I think that the case could be proved.<br><br>
I thought that I might be asked to give an example of a moral duty which was not enforced by the law and which did not attract a sanction. An example would be if I came along and saw that the police were in trouble—let us say they were being assulted. I would say that there was a total moral duty to go to the assistance of the police, or, if one were not physically able to do so, at least to go to telephone for help in order to assist the police. No one has suggested that the failure to do that, although I would regard it as morally reprehensible, should attract a sanction in the criminal law.<br><br>
In other words, there are areas adjacent to the point which we are discussing at the moment where, I think very properly, we take the view that there is a moral code, there is a civil code, there is a duty to which we would all, I hope, pay more than lip service and according to which we would try to live but which we equally properly say is not necessary to be enshrined as the subject of a criminal offence with a sanction if we fail.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
At a later stage—I ought to concede this because, again, it may be put to me—I have no objection to the compulsory element entering in. For example, if we have someone on oath in court or on oath for precognition, there is a duty on such a person to speak the truth. If he does not do so, it is right that that moral duty which exists at that later stage—and as I have explained, at the earlier stage—should attract a criminal sanction. But that is in a situation where evidence is being given on oath, which is a very different set of circumstances. The present proposal is at a stage when it is entirely premature.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
I do not want to go on at length. I merely say that it is a point of some principle and some philosophical difference between the parties. I also think that there may be dangers in the whole business of the right to require names and addresses of witnesses. This is one of those strange arguments where I shall, no doubt, be accused of obstructing the police, but I am thinking of the police and their relations with the public.<br><br>
As I understand it, there is no limitation in the Bill on the number of people who might be called as witnesses, or at what stage the requirement shall be made. To take an example, if the police have reasonable cause to suspect that an offence is being committed in a dance hall—let us say they have information that someone is carrying cannabis in that dance hall—and they proceed to take five or six people out on the suspicion of committing an offence, they could then require the names and addresses of the other 494 people who were spending the evening at the disco.<br><br>
There are dangers and difficulties. It might be useful if the Minister, and I assume it is the Under-Secretary on this occasion—no, it is the Solicitor-General having a field day, presumably making up for the day he has missed—could say whether there is any limit to the gap in cases of this kind between the time when suspicion of an offence arises and the requirement of a witness to give his name and address, and also whether it could be done in, let us say, Hampden Park or in the biggest dance hall in Glasgow or whether he thinks that there is any limitation in that respect.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman might also address himself—this is the point I am coming to about the interests of the police—to the dangers which might arise, for example, in the case of demonstrations or picketing. I think it perfectly proper that if someone is committing an offence, whether it be at a picket or at a demonstration, he should be treated by the law in an even-handed way, in exactly the same way as anyone else would be if offending in a similar fashion on another occasion.<br><br>
There is a danger that the police may be tempted to use this provision in order to discover who is at the picket line and who is at the demonstration. Presumably, if they say that Mr. X is obstructing a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0127">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
lorry going into a plant, or if they say that Mr. X at a demonstration in George Square, Glasgow, is obstructing the police in the course of their duty, they can then say that everyone else there was a witness and everyone else there would therefore be forced to give his name and address and would be liable to a £50 penalty if he did not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that under the Employment Bill now going through the House there can also be a case of someone whom the police consider is not employed at the place where is picketing, and in that case also the sort of circumstances he is describing would arise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, the ramifications are considerable, and I know that the Scottish Trade Union Congress and a number of other very responsible bodies are worried about it. So we are entitled to ask the Solicitor-General whether he can give some sort of guarantee—though I suppose it is difficult to ask him to do that—or at least an indication in terms of guidance to police authorities that these provisions, the right to require "a witness"—I use the words in inverted commas—to give his name and address will genuinely be limited to people who have useful information about a suspected offence, and that they will not be used as a way of creating a catalogue, a sort of directory, of all those who have turned up for what might from a certain viewpoint be seen as a suspect gathering—that is, a demonstration or a picket—but whom most of us would see as attending something which it was their democratic right to attend if they wished.<br><br>
The obverse of that is that even if the Solicitor-General says that all this is just nonsense, it is fanciful, it is persecution mania, he must take it from me that there is a danger that these fears will continue and will be taken as genuine, and the people who will suffer as a result are the police themselves. We are regrettably in an unfortunate situation where, although we usually talk about relations between the police and the younger generation on the streets, one of the areas of friction undoubtedly is in the field of demonstrations and of justified political protest. We do not want anything put on the statute book
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
which will increase that friction and make the situation less manageable.<br><br>
Hon. Members on the Conservative Benches are understandably worried about friction at demonstrations and in industrial situations. I suggest to them that, apart from the wider philosophical point that I have advanced about the need not to have a sanction in this case but to leave it to the moral and civic code, there is a real point about friction and about relations with the police which should be taken into account.<br><br>
My final point relates to a situation at the other end of the scale, a hot pursuit situation. It is not a mass demonstration but perhaps a break-in such as we were talking about where a group of boys scatters and there is hot pursuit. I am not sure how valuable this provision is, because the sanction comes into effect if the person refuses to give his name and address or gives a false name and address. In a large number of cases where they refuse to give their name and address, they refuse by getting off their marks so quickly that they are never caught. So presumably in the vast majority of cases the sanction would be inoperable.<br><br>
I am therefore not sure that it is as useful a tool, if I may use the journeyman expression of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), as it is represented as being. It is one of those cases—I am afraid that a large number of the clauses in the Bill fall into this category—where the Government spokesman may suggest that something enormously valuable is being given to the police but which may turn out to be something of very limited use in practical terms and may, as I have said, lead to some rather counterproductive side-effects.<br><br>
I object to this provision in principle. I recognise that my objections may be open to misinterpretation, but I hope that they will appeal to the Solicitor-General, because certainly in his Traverse Theatre days—in his young and liberal phase—they would have been arguments that he could have approved, and I hope that there is still somewhere a chord which I can strike with them.<br><br>
I believe, as I have said, that these measures are a bit dangerous, that they may increase friction, and that therefore they are unbalanced. It is a matter of balance. Believe me, I am trying to be

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
helpful, I am not opposing merely for the sake of opposing. I think that, on balance, we would do better to leave it with the suspect and remove the witness from the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I can shorten the debate if I answer the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden straight away. I now understand why the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) wanted more time to consider the Bill. It has taken 12 months for the sluggish and indolent mind of the hon. Member for Garscadden to think up that very silly argument.<br><br>
As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman says that he objects in principle. Then he ought to advise the Committee why, if he objects in principle, he did not object in principle to the same power in the Labour Government's Bill—he did not even comment on it—and why he did not object in principle to a further power of detaining an innocent witness for a time to verify his name and address, which might be any time at all.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman pretends to a be a sensitive and scrupulous man. If his scruples, are based on such thin ice as the piece of paranoid humbuggery we have just listened to, they must be very thin principles.<br><br>
I thought for a moment that the hon. Gentleman was on the same side as the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. It may be helpful if I quote Thomson, which, no doubt, he has not had time to read, at page 26, paragraph 6.02:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not propose to alter the law so as to require a person to give a statement to the police, but we agree with most of our witnesses, including the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, that there should be a legal duty on anyone the police reasonably believe to be a potential witness to give his name and address. Failure to do so or the giving of a false name and address should be a statutory arrestable defence."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Solicitor-General give us any indication of who provided that evidence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solictor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am ignorant of who the particular person was in the Scottish Council as for Civil Liberties, but the council has not dissented from that. It has not complained of it. That is on the record.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is just one of a number of pressure groups which is trying to influence this Bill. I hold no brief for its view on any particular clause. But, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has accused me of being slipshod, and as he has stated what the attitude of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is, I can only assume that he has not read its submission, because it attacked this clause very strongly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the SCCL, like the hon. Gentleman, has very high principles which change from day to day.<br><br>
May I deal with one last matter? The police have much more to do, if somebody throws a bottle at Hampden Park, than to ask the entire crowd to remain in the stadium while, during the next three weeks, they record their names and addresses and verify them. That is quite far-fetched. This is merely to give them a power which they will exercise for the benefit of knowing the names of the witnesses. It seems to me a very simple power and a very sensible power. Nobody complained of it in the last Bill, and I see no reason why anyone should do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee rises, might I appeal to the Solicitor-General that, when we come back to consider the matter raised by my hon. Friend, the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on Tuesday of next week, we shall have serious consideration of serious points? If this kind of exchange continues and a serious issue that will affect the lives of the people of Scotland is to be trivialised in the way in which the Solicitor-General is trivialising it in his comments to my hon. Friend, that is not, with great respect doing the work of the Committee. It will not produce a good Bill at the end of our work here. I appeal to the Solicitor-General to give much more serious thought and consideration to the serious points raised by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) was the last person in this Committee to start lecturing

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
people on their behaviour. I should have thought that nothing was more trivialising, when in the last Committee we were unanimous that this power was necessary—and it went further—than for those on the Committee now who were silent then to say that they disbelieve in it in principle. That is complete humbug, and it is not trivial to say it.<br><br>
To give a policeman the right to ask a potential witness for his name and address and to require him to remain there while he notes it seems to me to give a simple and equitable power. In no circumstances could it be suggested—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. You are responsible for the conduct of the Committee. No one is arguing, and it is not fair to quote what we said previously—</span></p>
