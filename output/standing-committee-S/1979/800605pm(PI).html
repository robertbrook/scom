	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment, we are discussing the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 56, in page 19, line 21, after "trial", insert "in the High Court".</p>
	<p>No. 54, in page 19, line 29, leave out subsection (2).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that these amendments related to the clause which gave courts power to conduct trials in the absence of the accused. I was reminding the Committee that that was the subject of a very spirited debate in the Committee which considered Labour's Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. I also remember that on that occasion I was in alliance with the Conservatives. Perhaps it is as well that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is not here at the moment. A number of my hon. Friends and I voted with the Conservatives, defeated the clause and excised it from the Bill. It was not a matter of amendment. We carried the day or clause stand part. I am at the moment adhering strictly to the discussion of the amendments; however, in passing, irrespective of what happens to them, I say that we shall almost certainly want to make a similar attempt, though I recognise that it may be on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our reason for putting down these amendments is to attempt to mitigate the scope of a damaging provision. In our view it is quite wrong—I deliberately use moderate language—that a trial should
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
proceed in the absence of the accused. In amendments Nos. 55 and 56, we attempt to ensure that if this power survives at all on the solemn procedure—and I hope it does not—it will be available only to the High Court of Justiciary. In other words, it will not be available to a sheriff and jury trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54 seeks to ensure that there will be no such power in summary trials, so the only place where a trial could proceed in the absence of the accused would be in the High Court on Solemn procedure. That seems to me a sensible set of proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the justification for this clause as set out by the Lord Advocate under the Labour Administration—unless new arguments are adduced by Conservative Members—was a highly tendentious and, I believe, hypothetical argument which envisaged that at some future date we might have an outbreak of Baader Meinhof terrorism or something of that sort in Scotland. It was suggested that forethought leads to forearming, and that we need this provision in order to stand against that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is sensible to make laws on the basis of hypothetical fears. I was greatly strengthened by what the present Solicitor-General said in discussing this argument, as reported in column 387 of the Committee proceedings on Labour's Criminal Justice Bill. I see that the hon. and learned Gentleman is not now in his place. I hope that he will return soon, because I trust he will make at least a brief intervention in the debate in view of his very strong recorded views on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us be clear that this"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the then Labour Government's clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is designed to meet a phenomenon which has not happened in Scotland. I am not one who takes the view that, because it has happened in Germany or in Holland, it will therefore happen in Japan, Zululand and Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that that is how I would have put the argument, but I certainly agree with him that it would be quite wrong to change our law on the basis of a hypothetical fear which has not been realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background—leaving aside the problems of the clause stand part debate—I believe that we should attempt to limit those powers to the High Court of Justiciary and exclude them entirely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>971</span>
from the sheriff court. I know that that may not greatly appeal to the Solicitor-General, for he has made clear that he did not think that amendment of the clause was a possiblity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee—I know that these words will be taken seriously by the Under-Secretary—of the extraordinarily strong opening to the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee should understand what a fundamental constitutional suggestion clause 24 makes."</p></blockquote>
Clause 24 was the equivalent clause.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reason that I omitted any amendments to it is that I could draft no amendment which in my opinion cured its dangers. If one were to find safeguards which made it acceptable or even a bearable though loathsome necessity, they would have to be extensive and rigid."</p></blockquote>
But the important point that I make is that the Solicitor-General's view then was that it was a fundamental constitutional change, and that he did not draft amendments because it was his opinion that
	<br><blockquote><p>"I could draft no amendment which … cured its dangers."</p></blockquote>
That is quite extraordinary. The Solicitor-General is absent. His very place has at the moment been usurped by the Under-Secretary, and the Solicitor-General is not here to give us the benefit of an explanation why a clause that was so essentially evil that it was impossible even to draft amendments has turned up, like a bad penny, in the Conservative Bill. It has, I recognise the important but comparatively limited difference that, once a person is consigned to the cells and the trial proceeds in his absence, there will be legal representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely this is what has happened to the Solicitor-General. Clearly, the Government have confined him to the cells in the Scottish Office, and he has legal representation here. He is palpably bound, gagged and in the cells, because he would presumably have voted with us if he had come here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting theory. No doubt the Under-Secretary will comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, despite the Solicitor-General's view then that the clause was so bad that it could not be amended, I hope that the amendments that I have now tabled will find some favour. The Solicitor-General
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
went on to refer to the whole concept in the strongest language. He talked about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the unbreachable and undilutable principle of natural justice that a man should be present during his trial."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1979; c. 387–388.]</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I welcome the hon. and learned Gentleman to the Committee, just in time to hear his own words echoing round the room. I agree with him 100 per cent. It is indeed an important principle, and I await with interest the remarks that, now he is here, he will surely make to explain how he has changed his mind on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not engaged in a clause stand part debate. I intend to stop at this point, because we shall have a clause stand part debate. I mention these factors to give a little background to the amendments and to explain why I am so anxious that we should at least limit the scope and area in which the power can be used. I am reserving my position on the clause stand part debate, and I imagine that I speak here for almost all my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will look sympathetically at this effort to ensure that, if the power is used, it is used only in the highest judicial court in the land. I think that makes sense because, if there is preparation for the Baader Meinhoff type of terrorism—during the last debate—the Solicitor-General talked a good deal about the terrorism that could emerge from the Irish question, with people failing to recognise the courts, and so on—it is very unlikely that people perpetrating that kind of offence will end up in a summary or a district court. They will be in the High Court and, in those circumstances, much as I dislike the whole concept, if this provision is to be put on to the statute book it should be limited in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that even those who mistakenly see virtue in the idea, or are scared about our future prospects and see virtue in now legislating against future storms, should be able to join me in this sensible attempt to minimise the damage that would be done and to ensure that those who might use that power are restricted to the highest court in the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the Committee at this stage if I responded to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscardden (Mr. Dewar) and,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
therefore, to the specific amendments before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will have read the repeat of the debate that took place under the previous Government's Bill. The hon. Gentleman has made reference to some of the changes that have been made to that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two specific changes have been made to the previous Government's Bill: first, to provide for legal representation of any accused person who is removed from the court for his behaviour; and, secondly, to make specific provision for his return if the court is satisfied that that behaviour will not continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is important as it was contained in an amendment that was pressed by a number of noble Lords in another place, and the Government took it to be a perfectly reasonable proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his usual charitable fashion, the hon. Member for Garscadden has made a number of references to the comments made by my hon. and learned Friend during debates on the Labour Government's Bill. To be fair to the Committee, it would have been helpful if the hon. Gentleman had given the Committee the full flavour of my hon. and learned Friend's remarks. The reference to which I draw his attention is the concluding remarks, in which my hon. and learned Friend said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But in the absence of any provision for his representation in his absence, any provision for advice as to what the dangers of his actions are and any provision for his recall or repentance and any provision for his hearing the evidence, this horrific breach of the laws of natural justice is one which I would not be willing to support at all."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1979; c.389.]</p></blockquote>
The specific points made clear by my hon. and learned Friends were that Labour's proposal provided no representation and had no provision for the recall of the person who had been removed from the court. Those are specific changes that are now included in the clause under discussion. I think that my hon. and learned Friend made it clear to the Committee considering that Bill that those were points which might reconcile those who were concerned about the clause itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the general purpose of
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
the clause, clearly, the difficulty arises when an accused person, through his own behaviour, simply makes it impossible for the normal process of the court and the normal hearing of the trial to continue. We are here concerned not with someone who may passionately disagree with what the trial is all about but remains silent during the course of the trial, but with someone who by his shouting, deeds and actions, literally, makes the proceedings impossible. There have been experiences in other countries—fortunately not yet in Scotland—of that difficulty. The Committee should address itself to what should be done in such a situation. Do we, as in some countries, tie the accused to his chair, stuff a gag in his mouth and physically restrain him in every possible way from uttering a sound or doing anything to interrupt the process developing in the court, or do we use the remedy provided for in the clause? That point has not been properly considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made the distinction, which he believed to be appropriate, between solemn and summary jurisdiction. He pointed out that if the purpose of the clause was to deal with the sort of case that I have mentioned, clearly such an accused would be likely to appear only in the High Court, or at least on indictment in the sheriff court. That argument has substantial strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be recommending acceptance of amendment No. 54, the effect of which would be to reserve this power to cases under solemn jurisdiction alone and not to those under summary jurisdiction. For the reason that the hon. Gentleman eloquently argued, we accept that this is an appropriate distinction to be drawn and, accordingly, I recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not labour the case made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). The principle of the clause is repugnant to me as a layman. That feeling was shared by the present Solicitor-General in the previous Committee. He referred to the fundamental constitutional suggestion made by this clause. The Lord Advocate of the time said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I share the concern and reluctance with which members of the Committee look at the principle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
enshrined in the clause."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1979; c.392.]</p></blockquote>
It seems to me to breach one of the fundamental and well-founded axioms of the law about which we have all heard—justice being seen to be done, and a person being tried by his peers in open court, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments, and I welcome the Minister's part compromise, but I am opposed to the whole tenor of the clause. I shall oppose it in a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even a small concession in these hard times—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A big one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of perspective. The fact that the Under-Secretary believes that he has made a big concession is depressing, if not alarming. I regard it as one small step for mankind, but it may be a major leap for the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not my hon. Friend accept that, compared with the concessions that we had on the Bill so far, this is a major one? It may not be much, but it is a major concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that one should always look at happenings in their context. As a trained historian, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is probably better versed than I or my other colleagues. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his agreement that at least this power should not be available under summary jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 55 and 56 were to go a little further. But that seems to carry the logic of my argument—to which the Under-Secretary was good enough to make fairly charitable references—that bit further. I am suggesting that it should be limited to the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having agreed on the major division between summary and solemn, would it not be sensible to assume again, as I was attempting to argue, that any cases of the kind that fell into the very narrow description likely to be the subject of this kind of procedure would be very rare? The Solicitor-General waxed somewhat sar-
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
castic on the point and made it clear that he had never come across such a case. He said that the nearest was that of Matt Lygate. The then Lord Advocate agreed that he had never come across such a case. They must be very rare. The civil disturbance, commotion and general individual insanity that would give rise to the extreme circumstances in which a judge or sheriff would be tempted to use this power must surely arise only in very special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the logic of that argument and agree that we should, therefore, leave it only with solumn procedure, it would have been a little more reassuring and sensible to tidy it up and leave it to the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Under-Secretary not show improvement with practice? We have had two concessions during the course of these proceedings, and I hope that he may just inch forward a little more and accept amendments Nos. 55 and 56. I am glad that amendment No. 54 is acceptable, but he might well get a more glowing commendation. He might be able to sit polishing his halo with more justification if he accepted amendment Nos. 55 and 56.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his invitation. The hon. Gentleman has not spoken to amendment No. 55, but it appears to be a drafting amendment and does not affect the significance of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards amendment No. 56, I accept that it is essentially and ultimately a subjective matter where one draws a distinction of this kind. It is generally accepted that solemn jurisdiction is jurisdiction used for serious cases and some not so serious If we are to draw a line, it is more appropriate that it is drawn in the way I have indicated. I prefer to keep it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that amendment No. 55 was a necessary precursor of amendment No. 56. I am happy to seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 55, but I should like to formally move amendment No. 56. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 54, in page 19, line 29, leave out subsection (2).—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise at a moment of great victory. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has had two concessions from the Government today, and that is indeed progress. We are against accepting crumbs from the rich man's table, but we are grateful for these two concessions. The Government will expect a debate on clause stand part. True to type, as I laid down the work programme to save the civil servants mapping it out, we knew that the Under-Secretary of State would be dealing with this clause because the Solicitor-General dealt with the matter on the Labour Government Bill, and the tactics that have been adopted are being maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all honesty, I am astonished to find the clause back in the Bill at all. Because the Solicitor-General—then speaking for the Opposition—not only objected to the clause but was the main instigator in ensuring that the clause was removed from the Bill. When my noble Friend Lord Murray—then Lord Advocate—said that he would look at the clause again, the present Solicitor-General said that even with the specific guarantees and undertakings that the then Lord Advocate was giving, he could not advise the Committee to vote for such a radical departure from the law of Scotland. I must hand it to the Under-Secretary of State for finding three lines in pages and pages of what the present Solicitor-General said that justify this clause coming back into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was another condition and the possibility that the accused,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>978</span>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>above all, should be able to hear the evidence. The Solicitor-General said—and this was the crucial point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the accused above all should be able to hear it."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1979; c.389.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>If words mean anything, "above all" must mean that that is a basic requirement, and it is not in here. The point that I am making to my hon. Friend is that another possible safeguard, which the Solicitor-General said was necessary, was that the accused should be able to hear the evidence. What he said in column 389 was the accused "above all" should be able to hear it. This was his most important consideration and it is not included in this clause.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but I must say to him that there is an even more damning indictment on the now Solicitor-General. This is not in what he said himself, but in words with which he agreed that my noble Friend the then Lord Advocate said in the proceedings of the Labour's Bill. The Lord Advocate said that it appeared that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as far as terrorism is concerned, the only realistic alternative is that put by the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) who said, in effect, that the right for an accused person to be present in a trial was so sacred that the accused should, if necessary, be constrained in court."</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Member indicated his agreement. These were not words uttered by the now Solicitor-General. They were words of the Lord Advocate agreed to, according to the record, by the now Solicitor-General. They asserted that the right for that person to be present in court was so sacred that he should be restrained in court, that the accused person should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"handcuffed, tied down, gagged, unable to speak". [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1980, c.393.]</p></blockquote>
That was the type of provision for which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
the now Solicitor-General was then appearing to ask. I know that Government Back Benchers are tied down, gagged and restrained and unable to speak. Therefore, they should put themselves in the position of an accused person who is not present at his own trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious for a minute, Mr. Gourlay, that was the kind of safeguard for which the Solicitor-General was asking. There are no such safeguards in the clause. The only major difference in the clause is the legal representation difference, whereby, if the accused person has been removed, his legal representative must be present. I do not regard that as the blinding conversion that has led the Solicitor-General to agree to the clause coming back into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened is that the Solicitor-General has stood on its head all that he said. It was he who inspired the vote on Labour's Bill and who pleaded with the Committee to throw out the clause. Never for a minute did I dream, when the Solicitor-General was promoted to his present exalted office, that we would see the clause back in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman also bearing in mind the case where the accused may not be represented? The case was quoted of the client who fired the hon. and learned Gentleman and carried on on his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we shall not have a clause stand part debate which is purely a rehash of the debate which took place in Committee last year. We are discussing the clause as it is in the Bill now. While I do not mind references on occasion to the earlier Committee's debates, we do not want this clause stand part debate to be purely on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very important rehash, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not matter how important it is. If I do not consider that it is relevant, it is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is relevant to the extent that the clause is back in the Bill, when it
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
was taken out at the instigation of the present Solicitor-General. The legal profession and everyone else is entitled to know what has caused the second most senior Law Officer in Scotland to change his mind on such "a vital principle." These are not my words but his. I remember sitting where the Under-Secretary is sitting now and having to take all these statements—although my noble Friend was dealing with the debate—and being chided by the Solicitor-General about this great breach in the law that was taking place. Lo and behold, we find that there has been a blinding conversion and that the clause is back in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear a great deal talked about the possible trial of terrorists. I had the opportunity to go to Stockholm and sit in at the Baader Meinhoff terrorist trial. Nineteen of the Baader Meinhof gang were on trial at that time. The only one who was not was its leader. Not one of them was handcuffed. Swedish courts adopt a very relaxed approach to major trials. Certainly the area surrounding the court outside was under very strict security, but inside the court the accused all sat together, no exceptional precautions were taken and the evidence was all given sitting down. I am not saying that I was impressed by the Baader Meinhof terrorists, but I was astonished by the relaxed approach to such a serious and dangerous group when it was on trial. Examples have been quoted of what happens in other countries, but the country that I have seen does not bear out the fear that has been expressed about terrorist trials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, this is a major departure in Scottish law and in criminal justice in Scotland. As the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) said, we still have the problem when the accused person dismisses his legal representative. If the accused person were removed, the court might appoint someone to represent him when the hearing was to continue. I do not think—if this is what the Under-Secretary will say—that under this clause there is a possibility of an accused person not being represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is no possibility of that, but the legal representative of the accused person could easily be a totally different person from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
individual representing him or her at the trial proceedings before the accused person was removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am happy to leave my remarks on the record and to content myself in the knowledge that it could not be electioneering. I do not believe that one candidate in the last election won or lost a vote because someone who disrupted a trial was to be removed from the dock and the trial was to take place in his absence. Therefore, I do not accuse the Solicitor-General of electioneering on this clause, although he was electioneering on other clauses in the Bill, and we shall come to them later. That leads me to the conclusion that he honestly believed that this was a major departure from criminal law in Scotland and ought not to be proceeded with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout his remarks in the earlier Committee the Solicitor-General said time and time again that there were no circumstances, even with the guarantees that the then Lord Advocate was giving, in which he would support this kind of measure. We have it back in the Bill, and hon. Members will have to make up their minds whether they support the proposal contained in the clause. If, when the vote is taken, I decide that the clause should not stand part of the Bill, it will be because I was totally persuaded by the Solicitor-General the last time he spoke on this matter. I have not made up my mind on this. (	<i>Interruption.</i>) I was hoping to persuade the two Government Front Bench spokesmen to change places. I hear the Solicitor-General pleading with the Under-Secretary to pass him his briefs so that he can take over. I advise the Under-Secretary of State to do that and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it was the now Solicitor-General who made the running during that last debate, it is worth pointing out that the present Under-Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), the Government Whip, both voted with him on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I try to avoid mentioning the Government Whip these days, because I remember those stentorian addresses to the effect that "This is a terrible breach of Scottish law, and we ought not to have it in this Bill." I am doing my best to forget the addresses that we used to get,
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
if only my hon. Friend will give me the opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Solicitor-General, if his junior colleague the Under-Secretary will not give him the briefs to reply to this debate, to exercise his authority. The Solicitor-General has some authority in this Committee. He should take the briefing from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and reply to the debate and explain to us—we are all here to be persuaded—what has happened. Apart from the fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman is now the Solicitor-General, which is not unimportant, what has happened to bring about this blinding conversion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the press reports this debate, as it assuredly will, we shall get banner head lines tomorrow about clause 21. I have no doubt that it will overtake anything else that may be anticipated. It would be unfair to the Solicitor-General if he were misrepresented in the press tomorrow. He ought to exercise his authority over his junior colleague, take these briefs from him, and explain why he has changed his mind. We wait with baited breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case there should be any misunderstanding, it should be pointed out that the Solicitor-General is perfectly free to address the Committee with briefs or without. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to indicate that the viewpoint and the statements made by the Solicitor-General in last year's debate are now on the record of the Committee. It would be regarded by the Chair as tedious repetition for any other member of the Committee to pursue that line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should understand what a fundamental constitutional change clause 21 would make. The reason why some of us did not put down any amendments to it was that we felt that we could draft no amendments which, in our opinion, would remove its danger. If one were to find safeguards against such a disgraceful and loathsome proposition as this, they would have to be too extensive and rigid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, I believe that if we were to condone this horrific breach of the laws of natural justice I, as Member for Renfrewshire, West, would not be wiling to support it in any way. It is a breach of natural justice. It is foreign to our law, foreign to our system and horrific both to lawyers—and that might include the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
Solicitor-General—and myself, an honourable lay Member of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, I believe that it will enable the court to impose cumulative penalties. This has not been brought up yet, but the whole question of cumulative penalties is involved. For example, a man could be sentenced to two years' imprisonment for contempt of court, in addition to any condign punishment, and if he continued in contempt that term of imprisonment could be increased. There are no arrangements, even if such a drastic step could be taken, for the accused to hear the evidence in his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may recall that the Solicitor-General was quoted as saying that he believed that the accused should be able to hear the evidence. I certainly believe that above all the accused should be abletohear it. I would be cautious about throwing away an unbreachable and undilutable principle of natural justice: that a man should be present during his trial. I repeat that, above all, that principle must remain. I might go further. If we were to abandon so central a constitutional safeguard and do it so loosely and so nonchalantly, I should find it offensive in the extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other problems including some very serious matters. For example, we really want to know at what level it would be necessary for such action to be taken. After all, what remedy is open to a man in this position? What can any human being, charged with any offence, do in such a situation except shout to manifest his disturbance? After all, he is not going to produce a machine gun from his inside pocket or shoot people with funny darts out of his pen, because he has no possessions on him. No such assaults are committed in court. If they were, I believe that it would be too late to have any such provisions by the time had had been sent to the cells because he would have shot the judge and the jury, or whoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the reasons why we object. We also object because a judge or a sheriff, on indictment, certainly in the High Court, as the amendment has now been accepted, could remove a person at any time who has conducted himself in such a way that in the view of the court a proper trial did not take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, and I stress this, such misconduct could be at a very low level of behaviour. I wonder, as does my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
Member for Garscadden, who would decide when sufficient irritation had been caused. Quite often it could be people who have a very low threshold of resistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have cherished the value of open courts and open judgment. I have been inundated with innumerable missives from the newspaper proprietors of Scotland. They are up in arms about this monstrous attack upon constitutional freedoms. Editors of all the Scottish papers are saying that we must not have this constitutional freedom of removing a man from the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a great consolation to the person who was suddenly removed from his own trial to think that if the newspaper proprietors' association had its way he could at least read about in Carstairs or Barlinnie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But think what a distraction to open justice it would give to those under the age of 16. They would be unable to read about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the case has been amply put. This is a monstrous provision. The conditions that have been proposed by this Government to excuse an apparent change of heart from that which they held a year ago are not sufficient. Of course we welcome the legal representation. That is valuable. But the return of the person was implicit in the previous Act even if it was not explicit. Once the misconduct finished there was no reason for the person to be taken out. But the right of a person is not mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Under-Secretary to stand by their principles, have courage, accept that they are in error and withdraw the entire clause. We would support their action. They might even receive a mention in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> or the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i>—or even the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) finds it difficult to get into 	<i>The Scotsman</i> or the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> I know the problems that he has in that respect.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the points I was going to make to my hon. Friend. He is considerably more eloquent when he makes his own speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quote—as you have rightly ruled, Mr. Gourlay—but I wish to point out that there is at least a moral constitutional issue here, if not a legal constitutional issue. An attack has been made on the Solicitor-General for Scotland for turning on his head on this matter. But it should be pointed out that it was not just the Solicitor-General for Scotland who put forward this point and who attacked this clause during our previous debate. It was the whole of the Conservative Benches at that time who voted solidly. It was the Under-Secretary. It was the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) who voted on that occasion, along with his colleagues who are not on this Committee now. Therefore it was not just a standing-on-the-head by the Solicitor General but of all the Conservative Members. If they all believe so firmly in this principle I cannot understand how they can now allow this clause to be in the Bill. It was not a matter of a technical opposition. It was not just some problems they had with it. It was a vehement and eloquent plea on the rights of the accused person that was made on that occasion. Now, suddenly, we have this provision back in the Conservative Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There does not have to be an answer because at present there does not appear to be a problem. Why do I have to give an answer to a problem that does not exist at present? If there are circumstances where it will arise, that surely is the time to take action—not to invent hypothetical situations and then pass laws about them. The legal profession and Parliament should not take hypothetical situations. They should accept the situation as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
There is certainly at least one important occasion that I remember where the sort of proposal in the clause would have meant the loss to history of one of the greatest speeches ever made in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not, unfortunately, referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I was referring to the occasion when John Maclean, under regulations and laws of which he did not approve and of which many Labour Members certainly would not have approved, made one of the great Socialist speeches from the dock when he was tried for offences with which most of us today would not agree that he should have ever been charged. He was sentenced and eventually died as a result of that imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That speech goes down in history. If the clause had been in effect at the time, it is possible that John Maclean would never have made it. That would have been a great loss to history and to the Socialist movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that, as has been said on this occasion and on the last occasion, it is a right of the accused to be at a trial in person. The Government now seek to take that away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also tearrible indictment of the extent to which justice has slipped in this country. For example, Matt Lygate was not able to deliver his speech fully. He was prevented from doing so. The judge virtually suggested that it was because of the speech that he attempted to make that he received a longer sentence. I am not comparing the two speeches. Matt Lygate was not a John Maclean. But the point is valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to go into the full details of the Matt Lygate case. But, certainly, my hon. Friend has a point in that Matt Lygate was not allowed to make the speech. The sentence was very severe, far severer than he would have received in other circumstances. The fact remains that on one occasion both sides of the Committee, and, on this occasion, the Opposition, have said that it is an inalienable right of the person to be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There does not appear to be a great problem. Nobody seems to be able to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
remember a case when it was necessary, or would have been necessary, yet here it is in the Bill. The Conservatives voted against it last time. I only hope that this time—even though some of them are now holding high office—will have the same courage either to take it out or, if they cannot take it out, at least to encourage their hon. Friends to remove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a lot of fun at the expense of the Solicitor-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have not mentioned him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have not mentioned him. I accept that. I do not intend to quote from him, Mr. Gourlay, because I have your message ringing in my ears that it would be regarded as tedious repetition. I have accused the Solicitor-General of many things, but tediousness is not one of them. Other emotions flooded my mind as I listened to his speeches. If he had been prepared to favour us with a few words in this debate, it would certainly have not been tedious repetition. If he had supported his hon. Friend, it would have shown a degree of intellectual acrobatics which would have been remarkable and in no way tedious or, compared with his former speeches, repetitious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is totally correct in saying that there has been no major problem so far in Scotland that would justify the introduction of a provision which, in the normal sense, would be repugnant to our sense of justice. I believe that we all have to compromise on occasion. Although I do not like it if, daily in our courts or even every month in our courts, we had scenes of unmanageable mayhem where the dignity of the court and the workings of justice were being insulted and frustrated and sheriffs were returning to their chambers, snatching off their wigs and saying "For God's sake, I wish I could have had that man removed." But, nothing like that is happening. It is a purely hypothetical worry which may never materialise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General made that point in the last debate. The Lord Advocate, who is introducing the clause, made that point. I know of no one who has suggested otherwise. Some of us, looking into the darkest recesses of our memories, can remember people who caused trouble, but it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
trouble that was always manageable within the present bounds of contempt and the disciplines of our court structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are those who are mentally ill. But, they are in a different category and there is specific legislation for them. But, within the normal run of events, we have always managed without having recourse to something which seems to be totally alien to our traiditions. It is dangerous to introduce things such as this on the slim basis of possible future worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I caution Government Members that they should not countenance it. It was defeated by Back-Bench revolts in the previous Committee proceedings. I see no reason why we should not see a little smeddum—a little spunk—from the Conservative Back Benchers on this occasion, because I genuinly believe that there are Conservative Members here, who must have the gravest doubts, not only about the propriety of this innovation, but about its necessity. There can be no argument about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point was made most forcibly by the Solicitor-General in the previous debate. If one removes a man during his trial there are no adequate safeguards that can be written in. As he rightly said, amendments are hopeless, because the heart is being taken out of the defence in the vast majority of cases. Apart from what I consider to be the central right to hear what is happening at one's own trial so that, if convicted, one can understand why that happened and why one is serving a sentence which has been imposed, there is also the point that if one is not there one cannot give evidence on one's own behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not matter how skilled the counsel or how expert the solicitor or legal representative may be, if at the end of the Crown case there is a prima facie case to answer, if the man is not there to go into the box he has lost any possibility of successfully defending himself. All that the lawyer may do on his behalf is to look for some technical flaw in the Crown's case which might not be there. And he might be uncomfortably aware that there was a possibility of a good defence, which was lost for ever because of the absence of the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought given the total lack of problems in this area in the past, that even in the occasional case, where the person is not covered by the Mental Health Acts but where, for some personal reason, which we cannot understand,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
it is presumed that he will create trouble, the best way to deal with it is by having him removed under the laws of contempt so that the trial stops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand and I can sympathise that occasionally it may not be possible to continue with the trial. My guess would be that one should take the man down to the cells, say to him that he is making it impossible for the trial to continue and that he will remain there until he is prepared to allow the court to continue in reasonable order. That would be a much more sensible way of dealing with the strange circumstances in which that would happen rather then bringing on to the statute book this peculiar and obnoxious provision which is enshrined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I very much hope that the Under-Secretary of State, having given us one useful concession—it was not an amendment to the power, but a restriction of the power—will go further and recognise that one cannot make palatable the unpalatable and that it is best to recognise that we are worrying about a problem which has not manifested itself in any significant way and which, if it occurs on occasions, can be dealt with in a more tactful and less fundamentally damaging way to our system of justice than that envisaged in the clause, can be dealt with in a more tactful and less fundamentally damaging way to our system of justice than that envisaged in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened very carefully to the remarks made by Opposition Members because I recognise the seriousness of the principle involved—there is no question about that. No one suggests that this is a trivial matter or one that can be easily overlooked or dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general basis of the arguments put relates to the accused's right to hear the evidence against him and to give evidence. These are principles which I not only recognise but fully accept. But hon. Gentlemen opposite must equally accept that we are dealing with a situation which, if it arises, will be one where no evidence is put because the accused is so conducting himself that the trial cannot proceed. That point is specifically provided for in the clause: the accused's conduct has to be such that, in the view of the court, a proper trial cannot take place until he is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are not talking about a situation
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
where the evidence is being given and the accused is being removed; we are talking about a situation where the accused's behaviour is so bad and is so interfering with the business of the court that the evidence of other witnesses and of other matters before the court cannot be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden correctly put the point that if the accused is behaving in an unacceptable way he should be taken to the cells and told that unless his behaviour improves he will not be brought up again. That is exactly what the clause also provides, with the one qualification that the trial goes on. That is far more likely to lead to the accused behaving himself than if he knows that, by his behaviour, he has not only interrupted the trial but that the trial cannot proceed unless he promises to improve himself. That is a far greater incentive to learn to behave himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have rightly and naturally drawn comparisons between the remarks made during our debate on the previous Bill and the position of the Government today. I am happy to defend the Government's position. I agree that one can take a position of total hostility to provisions of any kind in the proposals, but I quoted the remarks of my hon. and learned Friend, who drew attention at the time to the omission in the Labour Government's Bill of any provision for representation for an accused who is not represented and, just as important, as the hon. Member for Garscadden has pointed out, for any limitation on the length of time for which the person will be removed from the court.

We have made these two specific changes in the clause, and while I accept that they will not deal fully and comprehensively with those who have a fundamental objection to the proposals, nevertheless they give very important safeguards to an accused person whose behaviour has led to action of this kind. First, it ensures, which the previous proposal would not have done, that if a person is absented from the court there will be someone in all cases to represent his interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) that even if the accused has dismissed his solicitor or his counsel—he is entitled to do that—he can remain in court and the trial will continue on that basis. If he has been removed from the court, the clause specifically provides that, if he is not legally represented, a legally-qualified person has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
to be, not might be, or can be, but has to be appointed to represent his interest during his absence. That is the first major change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There might be some argument on appeal on the degree of misconduct, where the accused might plead that it was not sufficient to warrant his removal from the court under this provision. Is there not a danger of the court of appeal making a change in the decision given at the lower court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a matter that the right hon. Gentleman is right to raise. The terms of the clause are that if, in the view of the court, a proper trial cannot take place the accused may be removed. It is a discretion given to the court and the court would not wish to exercise its discretion unless there were overwhelming reasons, obvious to anyone in the court, why the exercise of the power was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps using the phrase "proper trial"—it is in the Bill. I think that there may be grave reservations whether one can have a proper trial without the accused being present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One certainly can, because there is provision for those who are mentally ill, in very limited circumstances. For example, there is provision for preliminary pleas to take place in their absence if certain conditions are satisfied. So there is no question about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the important point is that this is a major change: that there will always be legal representation of anyone who is absent, and, equally important, as soon as there is any evidence to suggest that the accused's behaviour has improved and that he is prepared to allow the normal process of the trial to continue, he will immediately be brought back into the court to hear the proceedings, because the clause specifically states that he shall be removed
	<br><blockquote><p>"for so long as his conduct may make necessary".</p></blockquote>
That is, equally, a change which was not in the previous proposal, and we believe it to be an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have said that this proposal may never be needed. They are correct. I hope that they are right. However, if it is never needed, I can assure them that it will never be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact the Minister slightly anticipated me. The fact that it is never needed does not mean that it will never be used. The proper diffidence may be loosened with time and the fact that the power is there may mean that it is used. I think it would have been easier for the Under-Secretary to argue his case on that point if it had applied to the High Court alone. If one spills it over into the sheriff court, which the Under-Secretary, by refusing amendment No. 55, has insisted in doing, the possibilities of abuse seem to me to be that much greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the sheriffs would necessarily take that observation in the spirit the hon. Gentleman intended. We are dealing with solemn jurisdiction. Courts have very wide powers apart from those in the clause to do all sorts of things in terms of contempt of court. But the clause specifically requires this power to be contemplated only when the proper conduct of the trial requires it, and I believe that if it is not needed it will not be used. Only if the courts are satisfied that it is necessary will they seek to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by emphasising that we are dealing with a power which, first of all would be used only for as long as the accused himself made it necessary. Secondly, we now have the fundamental new provision that the person will be legally represented during his absence. In those circumstances, I commend the clause to the Committee. I am not certain that the official Opposition spokesman will vote for it, but we shall find that out very shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will find out before we come to the vote. I said that I was here to be convinced. Nothing the Minister has said has convinced me, and in the voting I intend to join the illustrious ranks of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), the Solicitor-General for Scotland, and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, and change my mind from the last vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very interesting how, though indeed there have been changes of votes, we do not have the situation proposed by the hon. Gentleman. He was prepared to vote for a clause which removed the accused without legal representation for an unlimited period of time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
and without safeguards, but he is not prepared to vote for a clause which ensures legal respresentation and limits the period of time for the purpose. That is very interesting, and I find it slightly difficult to understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not possibly allow those misleading remarks to go unchallenged. I explained at the beginning of my remarks that during the debate on the previous Bill the present Solicitor-General had almost persuaded me. In the mean time, I have had time to study this problem, even going to Stockholm and watching the Baader Meinhof terrorist trial for a week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Fairbaim)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can help the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). If we remove all the safeguards for the accused, no doubt his
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
conscience will be at rest and he will be able to support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the Solicitor-General, today of all days, is strongly in favour of belt and braces. He has added belt and braces to this clause and is hoping that that will hold up his trousers. What his junior colleague the Under-Secretary of State has said does not hold up his trousers. It has not convinced me that what the Solicitor-General said in the previous debate ought not to be adhered to by the now Government Whip, the Solicitor-General himself and the Under-Secretary of State dealing with this Bill. I am delighted to be in such illustrious company in changing my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My amendment is a probing amendment. Perhaps I may probe in the course of a clause stand part debate. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I seek to withdraw the amendment at this stage.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate, for we are dealing with a clause which, surprisingly and rather late in the day, has attracted a great deal of attention. I find it surprising because I made a quick check of the debates on clause 25 of the Labour Government's measure, which was similar to this clause. It was slightly different in drafting, but its effect was exactly the same. There was almost no real debate on it, and no vote. It was a brief probing debate led by the present Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also looked at the debate in Committee in another place on this Bill, and again I found that no real anxiety was expressed. It was an extremely short debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have discovered only in the last few days that there is a great deal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>995</span>
of, if not public, certainly specialist, interest in this matter. It is important, therefore, that we have a reasonably far-reaching stand part debate. We know that we are doing so in the context of the Under-Secretary's thinking about the Government's position. He tabled amendments which he has now withdrawn. They were remarkable amendments—I shall not discuss them as they have been withdrawn—but they would have given no comfort to those who are expressing concern about the clause. I should have thought that they would get the worst of every world. I may explain that further in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I said what my understanding of the law is. I do so with some diffidence, because I do not have a battery of advisers to help me. But, as I understand it, there is normally, for the vast majority of juveniles—people under 16—who get into trouble with the law, no reporting of their names or of any circumstances that might lead to their identification. That is because the vast majority of such juveniles appear before the children's panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is fairly strict statutory authority for that in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. I believe that section 54—I am not quite sure, as it is some years since I was involved in the children's panel system—makes it clear that nothing can be published that tends to lead to the identification of a child who appears before a panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has not been, I understand, the same level of protection for juveniles who appear before the criminal courts. That is a little arbitrary and I think that there is a case for change. It is arbitrary because, although the distinction might be made that children who appear before the criminal courts are doing so on extremely serious charges, it is an over-simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, often children appear in courts because they are linked on a summary complaint with an adult. If a youth of 17 does a house in the next street and he has with him his kid cousin of 15, that cousin will appear in court, along with the youth. It does not in any way reflect the seriousness of the offence. It is the arbitrary chance of the person with whom he set out on the housebreaking expendition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
Juveniles are not protected as they were. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 stated that their names could be published unless a ban or prohibition was introduced by the court. To rectify that apparent anomaly this clause was introduced by the previous Labour Government and has now been reintroduced by the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to reporting we must decide whether juveniles who appear in court are in the same or roughly the same position as those who appear before children's panels and whether they should be put on the same legal footing and given protection. There is the important distinction that at least the courts can authorise publication under the proposed legislation but, as far as I know, there is no room for such authorisation under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, broadly speaking, correct about the children's panels. But as to solemn and summary jurisdiction, at the moment, the sort of provision proposed under clause 22 for all cases where a child appears in court are the restrictions which in general already exist under summary jurisdiction, but which it is now proposed should also apply in solemn jurisdiction. The summary case is at present dealt with under section 374 of the 1975 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I said that I was to some extent feeling my way. I hope that we have now set the scene between us and got it right. Clause 22 would put those who appear in solemn proceedings on the same footing as those in summary proceedings, and give all children who appear in court a level of protection which would be seen as analogous to the protection extended to juveniles in the children's panel system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises all sorts of extremely interesting speculations. It means that at the moment there is considerably less protection for a very small percentage of juveniles who appear in court on solemn procedure. I confess that my first instinct—it may be one to which I shall hold—is that they should be protected. There is a reasonable case for consistency in this matter. I am not convinced that there is a case for departing from the proposed legislation which would extend to them the level of protection which they do not have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
I say that, although I am aware that there are genuine considerations on the Government side. There are competing principles. First, the one to which I have referred, is a proper concern for the protection of a juvenile offender who is at a stage in his career at which we should be more interested in treatment than any other of the multiple aims that are inevitably built into any penal policy, and where we are hoping that there will be some element of reform or of reclamation—to use a rather strange word—in the way in which he is treated after getting into trouble. That concern is one to which we have to give great weight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I accept that there is also a matter of freedom of information to the public and freedom to print. I want to deal with that matter sensibly and reasonably sympathetically, but I have been a little upset by the way in which this campaign has been handled by those who are particularly worried about the clause. It is perhaps overstating the case to say that the campaign has been orchestrated, but I have been remarkably impressed by the plethora of articles appearing in the Scottish press over the last few days across the whole spectrum of publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember a time when I have been so quoted, by senior figures from the Scottish editorial world. We have been almost bombarded with letters by papers not normally noted for their friendliness with Labour Members. Indeed, I cannot remember a time when I as a Back Bencher have been canvassed in the Lobbies by the Lobby, if I may put it that way. I recognise that that represents a genuine level of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that it shows a genuine level of concern. Whether the concern is well based is something that I am about to start discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say what the genuine level of concern is about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to address myself to that problem. We should not think that people are not showing genuine concern, although it is a concern that hon. Members might not universally share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of balance between competing principles, and I object to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
way in which it has been handled by at least some of the press. Perhaps I may draw the Committee's attention to the article in the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> of Tuesday 3 June. Hon. Members will get the flavour of it if I read the article on the leading page, the main centre-page "thought-piece", if I do not use a misnomer, under the by-line of Dorothy-Grace Elder. It was sent—I find this pecular peculiarly insulting—apparently under the impression that they might persuade me to their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An amazing 'Thugs' Charter' which will cloak the identities of young criminals is planned by the Government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Behind-scenes moves are aimed at an astonishing new law to introduce secret justice to Scotland for under-16s found guilty of the most vicious crimes.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Clause 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will be a bovver bonanza for young killers, football hooligans and juvenile muggers. It will also enable adult criminals to hide behind youngsters.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Names will be kept secret and some of our most violent louts will be spared the embarrassment of publicity for their crimes. That sacred prop of democracy, the Scottish public's right to know, will be swept aside."</p></blockquote>
So the article goes on, for four embarrassing columns. All that I can say is—the "sacred prop of democracy", forsooth. That kind of overstating of what is an important but nice argument—"nice" in the sense of being a balanced argument in which we want to look at the intricacies of it and not go in for scaremongering of this sort—is totally unhelpful. I know that one or two of my colleagues agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read the rest of that issue of the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> and I skipped my way through
	<br><blockquote><p>"Private hell of tragic student", "The advancing blue tide of home porn"—</p></blockquote>
that refers to the paper itself apparently—the exciting histories of Welsh arsonists, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"Fatal love of ski teacher",</p></blockquote>
I began to wonder what motivated the concern which I referred to as genuine a minute or two ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular—I hope that this is not thought of as a personalised attack on this newspaper, but it is worth considering—on page 4 we find an example of the use of a minor's name in a press story. There is a large headline which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Baby Alan's life of horror."</p></blockquote>
The article gives the story of a two-year-old child who has already suffered two brutal batterings from men in his mother's life.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
His father is in gaol for battering the boy when he was only four weeks old and reducing him to a spastic. I am not sure about the accuracy of the medical possibility of that, but he was extremely badly injured. The article refers to the mother's 20-year-old lover admitting to a horrifying attack on the child. The article states that the court heard this man's
	<br><blockquote><p>"chilling account of how he broke Alan's arm and battered his face and head because he would not stop crying."</p></blockquote>
Surely it would be more in the public interest to have articles about the dangers of violence to children. In case we missed any of the exciting details the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> gives the blood chilling statement in full detail right down to how the man ended up with
	<br><blockquote><p>"a lump of hair in my hand and I stopped."</p></blockquote>
Despite the public's right to know, and although the press is considered the sacred prop of democracy, I am not sure that it has the right to print such stories. It is important that people use their judgment. But the right to print them—and the name of the child, which is the real issue—should be valued by us as highly as do, perhaps, some gentlemen of the press. The important point is that this was not a story of local importance but a story from England. I understand that the people concerned live in Rotherham, which is a long way from Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading that story one begins to wonder just how valuable and important is the concern, and how valuable and important is the principle of the right to print. I do not believe that one should ever seek to gag the press on matters of genuine public moment. I accept that there is always a right to print a story of public interest. No one is trying to stop the press, but it is possible to print a story which gives the circumstances of a case and draws the necessary moral from the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about whether in a limited number of cases there should be an exception to the general protection to a juvenile which would allow the person who is either the victim or the offender to be specifically named. My view is—I have not discussed this with my colleagues—that there is no real addition to genuine public freedoms which would justify the considerable encroachment on the rights of the child. In many cases a situation
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
would be created which would put the child in a very difficult position from which he might take much longer to recover than he would otherwise have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a juvenile is on trial with an adult it is possible to say that Mr. So-and-so, aged 39, appeared with a juvenile, and to give the circumstances if they are of public interest, and draw the proper conclusion as regards changing public policy or morals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points made is that someone who is guilty of horrific crimes will escape the consequences of public exposure if the offences are against a child. The circumstances to which the press refer are, for example, where incest is committed by a father against his daughter or a father assaults his child. Indeed, there are cases where, perhaps through accident, material which identified children has been printed and this has been drawn to our attention. But if Mr. X is convicted of, say, assaulting his baby daughter and we pass clause 22 as it stands, all that the papers can say is that he has appeared in court and has been charged with assaulting a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that that is such a terrible deprivation. I believe that the press could still make its point and draw lessons from the circumstances. To go further and identify the child as a child of the accused will cause unnecessary distress to other members of the family, and if the child is of sufficient age, directly upon the child, with possible embarrassment to other people with whom they come into contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see it as very much a matter of balance. The Minister is anxious to know the wish of the Committee when considering his own position and I am certainly not convinced that the balance is in favour of abandoning the present provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will notice, Mr. Gourlay, that in her articles—to which I have referred, and I may not be the only one to refer to her—Miss Dorothy-Grace Elder used an interesting and significant phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Names will be kept secret and some of our most violent louts will be spared the embarrassment of publicity."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that that is a strong argument. The Committee would be well advised to eschew that argument if it is just a matter of a red face by bringing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
home through the widest possible publicity the wrongdoings of an individual—if, in the by-goings, one might say, we name people who may be victims in the case of children and sexual offences, or if we are merely going to drag a juvenile into that position for the sake of having some sort of revenge, which is almost implicit in the use of the phrase that I quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received a useful copy of a letter sent to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> by Mrs. Eileen Griffiths, secretary of the Association of Children's Panels. In the third paragraph she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The argument for identifying children involved in serious offences would appear to be largely vindictive."</p></blockquote>
That may be a harsh judgment. But when I read phrases such as the one I just quoted from an article in the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express,</i> when we see people saying that the real point of printing is to ensure that violent louts should not be spared the embarrassment of publicity, I begin to have some sympathy with Mrs. Griffiths's judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at the make-up of some of our popular newspapers and the way in which they engage in their circulation wars by diving, with unerring accuracy, for the lowest common demoninator of public interest, perhaps the only defence against the charge that the secretary of the Association of Children's Panels makes is to suggest that it is not just vindictiveness but that it is a matter of attracting new readership by titillating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That remark may be unfair. It is certainly unfair to many newspapers. But it is the sort of thing that in some cases lies at the heart of the anxiety of newspapers being allowed to print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the offence can be described and that adults who are involved can be described, I do not think that there is any serious restriction on the rights of the press, particularly as the clause does not upset the status quo—which as far as I know has not been challenged—of the vast mass of juvenile dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, for what it is worth, as one member of the Committee, if the Minister stands by his intentions, as presently enshrined in the Bill, he will have my support. I say, in passing, that I have looked carefully at the amendments, which I cannot discuss because they are not before us, but I do not quite understand
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
their point. As they are presently drafted their effect would be that when a child is only a witness and all the accused are adults publication would be possible, unless there was a specific ban from the court. I hope that I have understood the principal amendment, and if so I do not understand its point because it appears to remove the protection of the victim of possible publication with whom hon. Members would perhaps have the greatest sympathy, namely the child who is only a witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand, although I certainly do not sympathise with, the cry that a juvenile who has committed an offence should not be protected because he is, after all, a lout or a thug or an offender, or whatever emotive term one likes to use. If he is only a witness I am sure not that the protection should be lifted because one might say, there is no stigma to being a witness. But if the witness is a girl, for example, who has been interfered with there may be a very considerable stigma indeed attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What struck me about the Under-Secretary's amendments—and I mention this now merely because he may wish to think about them because he intends to proceed with them—is that he may get little thanks from those people who have been agitating for an attack on clause 22. They want to get at offenders and publish proceedings. They are protected under clause 22. Those for whom protection will be lifted, particularly if the word "witness only" includes a complainer or someone who is a witness who is interfered with—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
that it was not clear from the phrase in the amendment. It makes me more favourably disposed to the amendment, although I remain with the point that it does not go any way to meet the attack that has been made upon clause 22. In my view we should congratulate the Under-Secretary on standing firm on the main issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot of people wish to contribute to this debate and I do not want to take up any more time. But it is right that we should have a range of views and opinions. I do not take an absenter's view on this. Obviously the freedom of the press is important. When we look at penal law and consider that there is widespread protection for most juveniles in trouble, I do not believe that the inhibition on the press is such that strikes at the public interest. What the press has been prevented from printing is not anything worthwhile in terms of genuine information for the public. All the facts except the names can be revealed and that can be the basis for enlightened public discussion. One hopes that that is what the press is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be "interesting"—in inverted commas—to add the child's name or the name of the street, but it would put at risk the chances of rehabilitating that child if he is an offender, or scar his psyche if he is a victim. That is too high a price to pay for a not particularly valuable extension of press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would encourage the Under-Secretary and his colleagues on the Ministerial benches not to worry about the charge that they are misguided and to recognise that perhaps in unlikely places on this occasion they have genuine support from all parts of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has said, is an issue which has aroused a great deal of concern, not only in this Committee but in Scotland as a whole. I recognise, as he does, that there are important conflicting interests that require to be safeguarded. Having given very careful thought to this matter, I do not agree on a number of points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Gentleman, I have received a number of powerful representations from the press and also from those who have an interest in children's panel schemes. My view is that the existing balance is tilted slightly in favour of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
press and that that should be maintained. I do not want to disagree today with another member of the Front Bench on the law, but what is proposed in clause 22 is not just the introduction of what occurs under section 374 of the 1975 Act in relation to summary offences. That section states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… no newspaper report of any summary proceedings …"</p></blockquote>
involving children. That is the rubric of it, but it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… no newspaper report of any summary proceedings in the sheriff court in respect of an offence by a child…"</p></blockquote>
As I understand the law, if there is a summary case which has a child either as a victim or as a witness, unless one finds that the court applies the provisions of section 169 and says that there can be no reporting of that aspect, in both solemn and summary procedures there can be no reporting at all, not just of the case involving an offence by the child, but where that child is a victim or indeed, a witness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend may have misread section 374. Subsection (1) refers to a child accused, later in that same subsection it says that no reference may be made
	<br><blockquote><p>"either as being the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or as being a witness therein".</p></blockquote>
If my hon. Friend reads the whole of that subsection he will appreciate that the summary of proposals that presently exist apply to witnesses, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, though, it has to be a case in which the proceedings relate to an offence by a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So if another of the witnesses were to be a child, certainly this restriction would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am getting at the case that was put to all members of the Committee. For example, in a case where a school teacher has gone away with the holiday fund of children and they have been defrauded, under the existing clause 22, as I understand it, unless a specific dispensation were to be given by the court, their names could not be revealed. I take issue and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
disagree with the Minister on this. The public generally and the newspapers have both the right to report and to comment on that and the public have the right to know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the argument that there is a number of special circumstances and that it would be perfectly proper for the court to say "No, you are not to report that." If children are involved in a trial either as the accused, as witnesses, or as victims it might be appropriate and an improvement in the law if the court were made aware that the matter was delicate. That is not clear now, and in practice I do not think that it is easy to determine whether the introduction of the restriction on publication is working well. I should like to see on Report some contemplation of an improvement on that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my view the balance is correctly tilted at present to say "You may continue to report, but if" there are special interests "—such as incest—"you should bear them in mind." Even without a statutory restriction, responsible editors now recognise that it would be inappropriate to report such cases. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) flashes a piece of paper giving a number of reports relating to a case of incest. As I understand that case, the editors themselves recognise that it was improperly reported. That is recognised. I do not think that they would seek to defend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that the balance is correctly tilted at present. There are two points on which I think that the Minister is correct. As he proposes in the clause, I should like to see a reduction of the age from 17 to 16. That reduction would be appropriate and sensible. Also, whatever happens and whatever decision the House finally makes, I, too, hope that there will be a uniformity of approach in both solemn and summary procedure. I find it very difficult to see why any distinction should be maintained in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us some indication about what he intends to do on Report, but I would not vote for clause 22 as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right to amend the restrictions on press reporting involving persons under 16 and to bring the law into line with the position as it applies to children's panels. It would provide a general restriction for accused witnesses or
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
complainers in relation to the publication of information. Anything which led to not identifying individuals in circumstances such as those would be absolutely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

It may be worthwhile putting on record the view of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, because it is much quoted in this Committee by Conservative Members—and I hasten to add, by Opposition Members. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I mentioned Conservative Members because their comments were inconsistent with the views of of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council says
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have no criticism of this clause but would observe that since it envisages exceptions to the general rule which would apply to both solemn and summary procedure, it would have been helpful if a statutory mechanism for dispensation of the requirements of this clause by either the Court or the Secretary of State was laid down."</p></blockquote>
I quote that comment because I would very much like to know the Government's view on the council's point about a statutory mechanism for dispensation. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State will refer to that when he addresses the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have very carefully read the submissions made to the Committee by the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society and the other articles and letters that we have received from the media. They have every right to express their point of view to us on this subject, and we have every right to say that we do not accept it and that we think that the greater public interest is served by the provisions of clause 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for the newspapers and the media was considerably damaged by the article which appeared in the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express.</i> That was so unhelpful to the newspapers. It talked about an "amazing 'Thugs' Charter'"—Good God, we are talking about the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill—and "behind-scenes moves". I am amazed at that. How can there be a behind-the-scenes move in a parliamentary Bill? I do not wish to give any comfort to Conservative Members—I have done my best to oppose the Bill and I shall go on opposing it night after night and day after day, and I think that they know that—but not even I would accuse them of "behind-scenes moves". They have put it in the Bill, they have put the Bill before Parliament and it is here this afternoon in front of the press, but somehow Dorothy-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1007</span>
Grace Elder manages to say that these are "behind-scenes moves". That article cannot be regarded as a constructive contribution to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the clause because I believe that young people must be protected. Even more important than that, young people who are coming before the courts must be afforded the opportunity to "come good". I do not want anything to happen to 16-year-olds or people around that age which hinders in any way the opportunity for them to retrieve their lives and go on to make a useful contribution to society. If clause 22 assists that objective, it has my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very difficult question. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, it is a difficult balance between two important principles within our society. One of those important principles is the need for society to protect young children. Against that there is the second principle, which has been built into our constitution, of the freedom of the press and, from that freedom, its public duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are debating a simple question. I do not think that anyone in the Committee, whatever his view on the clauses, would dispute that in some cases there is a need to protect a child by not allowing his name to be published. I believe that that is generally acceptable. The question, framed in clause 22, being asked of the Committee today is how one achieves that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My instinct, which is based on an instinctive dislike of statutory restrictions on the freedom of the press, is that this should be done by way of the judge. I shall try to explain why. I believe that this should be left to the discretion of the judge and not be legislated on by Parliament because I am sure that whether the name of a child or a juvenile should be published depends on the crime, and the nature of it, and on the age of the child—whether he be 15½ years of age and a child murderer or 13 years of age and convicted of a lesser crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only person, in each case, who can assess where the balance should lie between the need for the public to know and the protection of the child is the judge himself at the time of the trial. That is why I believe that it is dangerous to try to tinker with the freedom of the press in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
We are saying, in general terms, that if the child who is to be a witness is a hero and perhaps rugger-tackles a robber who runs out of a bank, that child's name cannot be mentioned. Is that what we want? Some time ago a schoolteacher was shot in front of her class. Are we saying that the press should not be able to mention the name of the school because it is a particular
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to lead to the identification of"</p></blockquote>
the children at that school? Is that not an attack on the freedom of the press, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be dealing with the hon. Gentleman's speech in a moment, but, first I take up the point about discretion and whether a child should not only be reported, but reported favourably. Under the provision of subsection (1) it is open to the judge, on whom the hon. Gentleman relies, to direct that the name can be published. This was his own argument a moment ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and I stick by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State has said that he will listen to the views of the Committee. He will realise, as does my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), that I am not happy about this provision. However, I ask the Under-Secretary whether it would be possible, even from now, for prosecutors, whether they be procurators fiscal or advocates depute, to start to remind judges in Scotland on a much more regular basis of the powers that they have already to protect juveniles in solemn procedure. I ask that because on that basis, in the few weeks, if not few months, before we come to the Report stage, we might be able to obtain some indication as to whether this power is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will appreciate that it is the genuine fear of creating a general restriction which makes me fear this provision, because I believe that, where we have two principles of this kind, the balance between them must be maintained and not tilted too far in one direction, and that is what I feel the clause will achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The attack on the clause by Conservative Members is surprising and probably hypocritical. First, the Bill was published at the end of December 1979. We have now been in Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
since Easter on this Bill, and suddenly we are finding Conservative Members expressing strong reservations about this clause. They did not put down a single amendment to it. They have had plenty of time to do so, to express their concern about it through the normal procedures of the Committee, and yet they have not done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that they have not done so because they had not looked carefully at the clause until they received this mass of material from the press upon it in the last few weeks. As my hon. Friends have already pointed out, the press itself—considering that it claims to be is the great bastion of democracy—was pretty remiss itself in picking up the clause and getting out the material. I do not blame those who report our proceedings in this House for that in any way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trimmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that they themselves have read the Bill, and know the Bill, and are well aware of it. But they have difficulties with their own editors in having anything about this Committee printed in their papers in the first place. I do not blame them, but the Bill has been published. Yet only in the last week has the press appeared to be so concerned, and at the same time so have Government Members expressed their concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite may shake their heads, but certainly the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) expressed reservations and concern about the clause. Although he said that he would vote against it as it stands, he expressed reservations. That implies that there were amendments that could have have put down, but they were not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other hypocritical aspect I find in this, which is more worrying is this great term "freedom of the press". Those hon. Members are the same people who over the past weeks have voted consistently—although not spoken very consistently—to restrain the freedom of the individual in our society in a variety of ways. Now they suddenly jump to the defence of the freedom of the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree with that view. Will the hon. Member let me continue. I am quite happy to give way to him if he wishes to intervene on his feet rather than from a sedentary position. "Freedom of the press" is a glib expression in many cases about which I personally have grave reservations anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that the Solicitor-General says "Hear, hear" to my remarks. It begins to worry me a little bit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest it be misunderstood, what I mean is that we all know that the hon. Gentleman has great reservations about the freedom of the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is clear that I have great reservations about the glib phrase "freedom of the press." Freedom of the press too often means the freedom of a remarkably few people to print and express their views without necessarily any great concern for the interests of the public. Who are these people to whom this freedom applies? It is not the people who come here and report our proceedings. They do not have freedom to say what they want, when they want. It is entirely the editorial concern of a few editors, and even editors do not necessarily have freedom. They are constrained by those who own the newspapers in our society. That is not a great freedom. It is a freedom for a remarkably few people, and that is all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our children, particularly, have a right to be protected in circumstances against such freedom. I do not quite understand the cases that have been raised. In the case of the schoolteacher who absconded with the money that was to be used for the kids' holiday it is said that it should be reported because it is in the interests of the public to know. Which members of the public ought to know?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that the children who had the money stolen from them know perfectly well who the schoolteacher is. They do not have to be told in a newspaper I am sure that their parents know. The headmaster of the school and the local education authority will know in such circumstances. So what members of the public need to know about that particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
schoolmaster? His name may well be published so long as the school is not identified. [Hon. Members: "No."] Or it may not be published because that could identify the school in certain circumstances. But there is no great crying need for the public to know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last debate the Solicitor-General made reference to the fact that the people in Cleve Street should know about 16-year-old John Smith who had been found guilty of attempted murder in 44 Glebe Street. It is highly likely that the people in Glebe Street would know anyway, because that would be neighbourhood gossip and not press reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, they need to know, he said, because:
	<br><blockquote><p>"they have living in their street somebody who is prone to such violence."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 February 1979; c.407.]</p></blockquote>
With all due respect, if the 16-year-old John Smith was found guilty of attempted murder, he would not be in the street. Therefore, there would not be a crying need for the people to know, because he would no longer be living among them. He would presumably be in some form of institution or training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give my full support to the clause. If I have one reservation, it is that the penalty for an offence by the press under this provision is limited to £500. That is not nearly high enough. We have other offences that seem to be minor, for which the penalties should be heavier. [Hon. Members: "Hang them".]. No, I am not a protagonist of a return to capital punishment. I have no wish to see editors of our newspapers either birched or hanged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forced to read their own papers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they should be forced to read their own newspapers, as my hon. Friend suggests. That might not be a bad idea. They might see how bad some of them are. However, because of the titillation that some papers go in for, for which they get high readership, £500 may seem a small penalty to pay if they can attract more readers as a result of printing a particularly salacious case which concerns children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second and final point is a question.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
Are we now speaking of double jeopardy again? An editor or publisher, having been found guilty of this offence, can be fined £500. Will he also still be liable to be charged with contempt of court if he has been found guilty as well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is so. Just for once, I believe in double jeopardy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the articulate and persuasive speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). However, I am puzzled that he did not make the same speech in 1979 when his own Government's clause 25 came up for debate. His silence on that occasion speaks volumes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinary attack, because I was supporting the clause. It is not normal to make long speeches when one supports a clause, only when one disapproves of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was about to make is that it is possible to speak volumes without speaking in volumes. Greater brevity might have been appropriate. I shall try to be as brief as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surprisingly, I find myself almost in agreement with one phrase of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) who referred to the glib phrase, "freedom of the press". I sometimes think that that is a glib banner behind which rogue journalists from Wilkes downwards have sheltered. Nevertheless, it is an important freedom, and one which must be given due weight. I find the phrase "the public's right to know" a more persuasive principle. That has to be subject to the special provisions which already exist and which have always existed since the Acts of 1686 and 1693.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a letter from the Scottish Association of Children's Panels which points out the present position:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act states that:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… In relation to any proceedings in any Court the Court 	<i>may direct</i> that …' no identification of persons under 17 should take place.â"</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The anomalies occur when the Court does not so direct, not because of any malicious intent on its part but because it has forgotten to do so."</p></blockquote>
The association urges support for clause 22 as it stands in the Bill. I cannot help
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
saying that forgetfulness on the part of the Court or its officers is surely a bad basis for legislation, but the point is well made, to the extent that it imposes on the press the duty to exercise great care and discretion in publishing names when, for some reason or another, it has not been directed not to publish them. The press ought to take cognisance of that. The point was well made by the references by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden to articles in the 	<i>Daily Express.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am persuaded by the deterrent effect if the press were entitled to name these young offenders. I am particularly concerned that the great rise in violent crime, by which I mean crimes of murder, culpable homicide and robbery with violence, is among young people. I believe that the deterrent effect of having their names published in the press would be strong. It is that argument which compels me to invite my hon. Friends to reconsider this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the reason why no amendments have been tabled is that the previous clauses dealt with the rights of the citizen, and this clause is slightly different. Furthermore, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, it is a matter of balance between two interests. The fact that the Government have received more support for the clause from the Opposition than from their own side would indicate that there is a dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why the status quo should be changed. No violent representations have been made about the need for it. I had not heard anything about abuse of the existing procedure until this clause came up. I admit that the two cases that were quoted horrified me, and were apiece of gross irresponsibility by the press. However, that is a small proportion of the number of cases reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public have the basic right to be informed. That is not just a glib phrase. It cannot be denied that the press has a special interest, but the fact that it is pushing that interest does not necessarily imply that public interest is involved. There definitely is on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A minor point is that the provision would not mean cases would be totally unrecorded. As long as people have the right to wander into the public gallery of the court, they can come out and spread the word about what has happened.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
Although the news would not be distributed on such a massive scale as by the daily press, the names and the rest could all come out. I do not pretend that the press report every case accurately but I certainly think that most cases are reported more accurately than they would be by word of mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that the article quoted from the 	<i>Daily Express</i> was pitched too high and in extravagant terms, does not affect the argument. Either we agree with the clause or we do not. I was attracted by the way that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) presented the case. I think that the way out of the difficulty is the case put forward by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). On balance, I would be opposed to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will accept that at the moment there is an anomaly which was explained by the Under-Secretary. There is a blanket protection in summary cases. Is the logic of his argument that we should seek to change the law to encroach upon that protection or remove it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not say that it is 100 per cent. ideal, but it would be hard to achieve that. The status quo is working fairly well and I would leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Mackay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and appreciate the argument put forward principally by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about the protection of juveniles, but I am not satisfied that the level of protection afforded them need be as absolute as it will be if this clause becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The campaign by the newspaper proprietors does not reflect on them. Every other pressure group and organisation is campaigning against the Bill and it is unfair for the Opposition to pick out one and complain about that. They do not take into consideration the equal pressure from other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps more as a parent than as anything else, I ask whether parents are to be denied information about wrongdoers. Are they to be denied it so that they cannot guard their children either against child wrongdoers or against adult wrongdoers with whom their children may come into contact?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

underlined the fact that children's panels were not reported. Perhaps one of the reasons for public lack of confidence in children's panels is that non-reporting. The supporters and members of children's panels call it ignorance. But I do not see how there can be anything other than public ignorance if what happens is not reported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a hypothetical situation to the hon. Member which, no doubt, could arise? Assuming, as he pleads, that the children's panel should also be reported, which case, in his opinion, would the newspapers choose on a particular day when there was a 15-year-old in the High Court on a murder charge and a 15-year-old in the children's panel for stealing from Woolworth's? Which case does the hon. Member think that would appear in the 	<i>Daily Express</i> the following day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am trying to short-circuit my argument. I do not think that I said that they should be reported. I suggested that what is called the public ignorance about children's panels is due to the fact that there are no reports of their proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have made much of the article in the 	<i>Daily Express.</i> They have ignored a more serious article—as one would expect—in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by posing the same question that George Watt poses in his article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the clause becomes law the anonymity of young criminals will become the regular practice unless the Judge decides otherwise. In most cases the use of names will go by default, or who is to ask the Judge to depart from the norm and permit the press to publish the child's identity?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Are the reporters to carry the public responsibility to pleading with the judge to make an exception? Or will the media in general have to employ counsel to put the public point of view? Since justice is a matter of public concern, the public view should be heard."</p></blockquote>
I should like my hon. Friend to consider just who shall suggest to the court that in a certain case the reporting restrictions that the clause will impose should be lifted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been times in the Committee when I have been angry. There have been times when I have been sad. I have been saddened beyond belief
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
by the speeches I have heard in the last hour. We have a group of people, six of them advocates, all educated, many of them with children—and one bark from the press and they all jump.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been debating serious matters of human liberty. We have been debating the problems of detention and search, plus a host of other freedoms, including the last freedom that so moved the Solicitor-General a year ago in relation to a prisoner in court. There has not been one cheep, not one brief intervention, not one question mark in any of the hon. Members' minds. The press barks and they jump. They jump in cowardice because they know that, whatever they say, or whatever their reservations are, we will vote in support of the Government. There has not been a more contemptible performance in a Committee by a group of Back Benchers for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Mackay) about protection by a parent. I ask him whether as a parent, he would advise his child to read this issue of the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express?</i> Out of 11 news pages, there are eight reasonably full, sometimes very full, descriptions of murder and one of suicide. The Tracey case is all over the front page. On page 3 there is: "Nightmare bed plunge", "Boy found strangled in cemetery"; "Dundee killings".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 4: "Baby Alan's life of Horror"—the baby battering;
	<br><blockquote><p>"Arsonist bragged of blaze to police".</p></blockquote>
Incidentally, they are so obsessed by death that even in page 4, we are told about an adult brown bear that escaped from its compound yesterday and then died after being subdued by a tranquilliser dart:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Bear's great escape ends in death."</p></blockquote>
On page 6 there are more court cases:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Court clears former county chie". "More urged to help prisoners keep from crime".</p></blockquote>
Page 7: "Man held in death hunt". Page 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The advancing blue tide of home porn".</p></blockquote>
That takes up half a page. On page 10, in a double column we see "Private hell of tragic student". That reports a suicide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the freedom that impels Members on the Conservative Benches to challenge their own Front Bench for the first time.

This is the freedom on which they are asking us to stand up and be counted. Let us examine this freedom a little further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member agree that the high content of crime in that newspaper and in many other editions reflects the need for the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is perhaps the need of the 	<i>Daily Express</i> to attempt to sell papers. That is the level of consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about press freedom. I have an impeccable position from which to discuss press freedom—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would not be in order to discuss press freedom under clause 22 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his remarks to the clause. Press freedom is ancillary to the clause but the main purpose of the clause is whether children under 16 should have protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been moved from anger to sadness. I am sometimes tempted to be moved from sadness to anger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is concerned with aspects of press freedom, and the rights or non-rights of the press to publish names and other particulars of children under 16. The rubric properly says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Restrictions on report of proceedings involving persons under 16."</p></blockquote>
I may be an ignoramus but I think that is something to do with the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. Neverthelsss I rule that we are not debating the general principle of the freedom of the press, but the restriction of reporting in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Gourlay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman started as though he was going to debate the whole question of the freedom of the press, and therefore I had to intervene to prevent him from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a tendency when I start to speak to believe that it is possible to anticipate what I am going to say. I am going to talk about the freedom of the press in relation to the restriction that has been put in this rubric. If you had allowed me to finish my setence, this little spat might not have occurred, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I am entitled to speak about the freedom of the press and I will say this in passing. I have been involved more than most in defence of journalists. I was involved in defence of the 	<i>Daily Record,</i> for example. My hon. Friend will remember the trial of the Scottish nationalists when a man refused to disclose his sources. That was also a problem of reporting and restrictions. It was I who stuck my neck out to defend a Scottish nationalist and that journalist. So I am entitled to speak about press freedom and members of the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask what freedoms we want. We have seen this kind of paper. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) without any interventions from the Chair, discussed at great length aspects of general press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the passing of this Bill—we are dealing with this Bill, I believe, Mr. Gourlay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with clause 22. We are not dealing with the Bill. I hope the hon. Gentleman will have regard to the rulings of the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with clause 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. It is a Bill which in its entirety deals with the freedoms of individuals of which this is one section. It is proper for me to ask why hon. Members opposite, and even more significantly, the press, have been so silent on matters of freedom. We then have to ask "Why the concern about this matter?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is put, on the centre page of the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express,</i> by someone with whom I have worked on press freedom: Miss Dorothy-Grace Elder. I worked with her in the attempt to establish the 	<i>Daily News</i> when the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> sacked its workers and threw them out of its offices in Glasgow. She did not have the freedom to run a newspaper in the way she wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is deliberately flouting my decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1019</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not deliberately—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is deliberately flouting my decision. He is starting to discuss individuals and the freedom of the press. I ask him, in the most responsible manner, to try to relate his arguments to the clause before the Committee, which deals with the restrictions that it is intended to place on the press on the reporting of certain incidents relating to people under 16. That does not allow us to debate the whole subject of the freedom of the press, present or past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing precisely with the article, which has been quoted at length before in the Committee, by Miss Dorothy-Grace Elder. I was giving a view of her in relation to press freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is exactly the point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is writing about this. This is her article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Chairman is on his feet, the hon. Gentleman must be seated. The point that I am trying to clarify for the hon. Gentleman is that, while he may quote from the article, he cannot discuss particular aspects of the person who writes, especially in relation to press freedom. We are not discussing press freedom. We are discussing clause 22 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. I must be very stupid. I thought that everyone else had discussed the balance of freedom in reporting. If I am not allowed to do so, that is fair enough. I shall refer no more to Miss Dorothy-Grace Elder. But anyone who reads the 	<i>Official Report</i> will know that I was with her in trying to establish the 	<i>Daily News</i> when the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> shut down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this paper, we see:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> has strongly supported this Bill on other controversial aspects; for example, greater powers for the police. But we believe this rogue Catch 22 must be fought in the interests of public safety and open justice."</p></blockquote>
In other words, my point—a valid point and, I believe, a point that is in order—is that this paper, which has led the attack on this aspect, also says that it supports every other infringement of civil liberties throughout the Bill. Perhaps I could
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
have made the point more simply, but I make no pretence to be particularly bright.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, as always, faced with a balance. If the balance were between disclosing a person's name or unfolding to the public a serious matter—such as preparations for nuclear war—one might say "To hell with the restriction on reporting. Let us publish this as a serious matter of public import". If it were a balance between reporting a person's name or a question of 1½ million jobs for our people, I should say "No problem. Report and be damned".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Editors in the past have gone to gaol for the right of freedom to report and be damned. What editor will go to gaol, with his head high, to say "I reported, with several photographs, a case of incest involving a seven-ear-old girl—and, furthermore, I printed her name"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not talking about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking precisely about that. It is nonsense. Hon. Members opposite have shown that for the last hour. They need not interrupt here. This is the kind of nonsense that we have been getting, and this is the dimension of it. The freedom that they are looking for is the freedom that I have demonstrated in this paper. It has nothing to do with press freedom. There is no reason why, in situations when it might be sued, it does not report names instead of saying "Miss X" and "Mr. Y". That is their great courage when they might be sued. Why do they not preserve anonymity in this child battering case? Why not say "A child aged seven"—with a description, if the paper really believes that that is necessary for press freedom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell me whether, under clause 22 as it stands, the press could publish the picture of an abducted child?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all sure whether it could, if a charge had been made against the person who had abducted her. Nor am I sure whether the hon. Gentleman has read clause 22 properly. It relates to people against whom proceedings have been taken. I quote—I hope that this is in order, Mr. Gourlay:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No newspaper report of any proceedings in a court shall reveal the name, address or school'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
Given their Front Bench's great opposition to the clause, hon. Members might at least have read it. It has been a spurious campaign, but it has been valuable in demonstrating the attitudes and behaviour of Government supporters. It has nothing to do with press freedom, but it has to do with selling the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on the side of the writer, and on the side of the journal. I am not on the side of the press barons. I am on the side of the Government on the clause, and I treat with the greatest sadness and contempt the behaviour of Back Benchers opposite, demonstrating as they are their courage in opposing the Government, for the first time, after such ages, in the knowledge that they will be protected by our votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is standard practice to begin a speech in this Committee by saying "I shall be brief." I am reminded of a catch phrase that a client of mine used to use "To let you understand," which usually meant that he was about to say "To cut a long story short," and then speak for a further half hour. I shall do no such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government are right in trying to protect children from unnecessary exposure to a public searchlight where they have been innocent victims or where such publicity could cause them harm. Equally, I believe that the press, as the fourth estate, has both a right and a duty to report and to inform the public about the seamy side of life—to reveal society to itself, warts and all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has, as has been said, a question of balance. But the issue that perturbs me is whether we yet have the balance right. I am particularly concerned about how the operation by the court of this directive of dispensation is to be initiated. I am not at all clear who is to do it and what the mechanism will be. I shall be most grateful if the Minister can tell us what consultations there have been between the Government and the press in the formulation of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know whether consideration has been given to a revamping of present guidelines that may come down from Crown Office to fiscals faced with taking charge of prosecutions in cases such as this. I believe that the intention is sound, but the clause as it stands leaves a number of doubts in hon. Members' minds. I therefore urge the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
take the clause away and think about it afresh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that my remarks will be cut short by the Division bells in the House, but I intend to plead, as reasonably as I can, the case for the Government retaining clause 22. I am glad that the Minister accepted this morning that he should withdraw the amendments in his name, because the debate that we have gives him tie to consider what has been said and whether there is any need to submit the amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, first, let me share the anger of my hon. Friend the Member' for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). It does Government Back Benchers no good to present themselves as press poodles. That is exactly what has happened during the debate. If those feelings were so strongly and firmly held, the Bill has been before Parliament since February, and there would have been an attempt before now to indicate, in amendment form, the views that we have heard today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the question of the press itself. This is the first time in nine years that I have had the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> in the House of Commons on the day after it was published. Usually it is three or four days late. I appeal to the Scottish press: if the way to get papers to Scottish Members of Parliament on time is to use my old industry, the Post Office, I commend that idea to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald, The Scotsman,</i> the 	<i>Daily Express</i> and the 	<i>Daily Record.</i> This is the first time in nine years that I have had 	<i>The Daily Express</i> the day after it was published. It is normally three or four days late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that, because the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express</i> is printed in Manchester, and that takes a lot longer to get from Manchester than it takes the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> to get from Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have fond memories of two years spent in Manchester, and I shall not stray into that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point about the press is that there is no more powerful issue than the press prosecuting its own case. I have no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
strong feelings about it. I have learned in politics to live with the press. I have a saying which I use in a lighthearted way that title press will never spoil a good story by getting it accurate. I go through life believing that. I am very tolerant of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
press. I understand it running this campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
