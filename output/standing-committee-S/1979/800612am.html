DETENTION OF YOUNG OFFENDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Amendment moved [10 June], No. 300, in page 35, line 10, leave out "4" and insert "3".—[<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 301, in page 35, line 30, leave out from "is" to "imposed" in line 32.</p>
<p>No. 302, in page 35, line 37, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"and any such additional period of detention will run concurrently with the period of detention being served by the convicted person in terms of the said subsection (5)".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of our last sitting I was making the point that these were comparatively narrow amendments and could be dealt with on that basis. They are to elucidate the Government's intentions. No doubt we shall soon be debating whether those intentions are valid and whether they should have the commendation and fair wind of the Committee.<br><br>
We are entering the area of the short sharp shock. I have a suspicion that this is a series of changes in the law in which imitation is one of the primary motives. We are following the mood of the Home Secretary south of the Border, and it totally undermines my confidence in the Union.<br><br>
The first amendment is to remove the upper limit of four months on detention centre training and restore the status quo of three months. This is a matter of judgment but traditionally in Scotland we have an established pattern that in a local detention centre three months is an adequate period. The Committee may well be in favour of short sharp shocks rather than very long hauls. However, if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1160</span>
one is to jolt a youngster to his senses—I have reservations about that whole concept—by injecting him into an artificial Army type glasshouse regime, to do so for three months, as the equivalent of a penal cold shower, is sufficient, without extending it to four months or, possibly, five months.<br><br>
I said that it was a matter of judgment, and in my judgment—I should be interested to hear the views of my hon. Friends—three months would be a more sensible upper limit for a period in a detention centre.<br><br>
I turn fairly briskly to amendment No. 301. As the Committee will recognise, this is an attempt to remove from subsection (7) the words
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) for a period of less than 28 days".</p></blockquote>
I can take with this amendment No. 302, which adds at the end of subsection (7)
<br><blockquote><p>"and any such additional period of detention will run concurrently with the period of detention being served by the convicted person in terms of the said subsection (5)".</p></blockquote>
I tabled these amendments because, in reading the clause, I had some difficulty in understanding the Government's exact intentions, and this is a useful way of getting the Solicitor-General to clarify the position.<br><br>
As the Committee will recognise, under subsection (2) anyone between the ages of 16 and 21 will be sentenced to a period of detention instead of imprisonment. Detention does not mean "detention centre", as is made clear in the clause, so we have two possibilities. Clearly, we are excluding borstal and imprisonment and we are left with detention which, as I understand it, can be subdivided into detention centre or young offenders' institution. Subsection (5) goes on to state that if the period of detention is more than 28 days but not more than four months, the options of the court are circumscribed and it must be detention centre.<br><br>
I seek to take out the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"for a period of less than 28 days"</p></blockquote>
in order to establish exactly what happens in these circumstances. A youth between 16 and 21 may be sentenced to 14 days' detention—an extraordinary sentence to impose and one that I hope would be very rare. Perhaps the Solicitor-General can confirm that that is possible in terms of this phraseology, because the provision specifically refers to where the sentence is less than 28 days, in which case, presumably, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1161</span>
youth does not go to a detention centre unless he is already in a detention centre for another reason and in connection with another offence.<br><br>
I say that somewhat tentatively. I hope that I have understood the situation correctly, but this is a somewhat confused and difficult piece of legal drafting. However, as I understand it, if the period were under 28 days, the youth would go to a young offenders' institution; again, if under 28 days, if he had already been under sentence at a detention centre, he would serve the sentence in a detention centre.<br><br>
I presume that paragraph (<i>b</i>)—
<br><blockquote><p>"imposed other than by way of sentence"</p></blockquote>
—will refer to non-payment of a fine. Again, for non-payment of a fine, I presume I am right in saying that what the Government envisage is that the unfortunate will go to a young offenders' institution to serve his detention unless he is already in a detention centre, in which case he will remain there to thole his second assize.<br><br>
I thought it was well worth while drawing attention to this matter as it is not very clear, certainly not to the lay reader—or, indeed, to me when I ploughed through it. Having established that and encouraged by the nods that I have it right, I can only say that I do not like the situation but at least I understand it.<br><br>
We then come to the substantive amendment, No. 302. As I understand the provision, it is envisaged that when a 28 days or less sentence is being served by someone who is in a detention centre, or if he goes to it as a result of non-payment of a fine, the period shall be served consecutively and not concurrently. There is a proposal that the four-month normal upper limit on a period in a detention centre may be pushed out to five months.<br><br>
The whole point of amendment No. 302—the drafting may of course be inaccurate but the intention is clear, I think, and that is what we want to debate— is that in a situation where someone is given an additional sentence in lieu of a fine, or for some reason is given a sentence of such a small period as under 28 days and is already serving up to four months in a detention centre, he should serve it not consecutively but concurrently, so that he would be discharged at the end of the four months, or four months less remission. Perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland could calculate exactly how long
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1162</span>
he would serve. It was nice when he was dealing in terms of three months because one could then say that a third off was two months. A third off four months I have not quite calculated, but no doubt his computer brain will quickly produce the figure.<br><br>
If there is any virtue in the short sharp shock approach, it seems to me that it has been achieved within the four months period—or three months if our amendment is successful—which is laid down in the statute. It is an embittering point, and of very little penal validity, to say that a small sentence of under 28 days should be tagged on consecutively. If the whole of clause 5 is based on the assumption that four months is the upper limit which someone can usefully serve under this type of punishment regime—which is how the Conservative Members see it—we should say "Right, that is it. That is the maximum and we shall not extend it to five months by adding a sclutter of sentences of under 28 days for nonpayment of a fine.”<br><br>
The slate should be wiped clean. The offender should have had his punishment, his cold shower, and should have been brought up short—and all the other cliches that will probably echo around this room during the hours that lie ahead. At that point he should be released for a new start in the hope that the punishment will have taken effect.<br><br>
To put him in for what the Government, after mature consideration, think is the maximum useful period to give the courts the right to add on consecutively sentences of under 28 days seems to make no sense in regard to the accused, to public expenditure, or to the organisation of the detention centre.<br><br>
I hope that no sheriff in his right mind would want to sentence someone to less than 28 days, anyway, having been told that he is already serving a period of detention centre training which can extend up to four months. Let us not rely on the good sense of the shrieval bench and let us ensure that any such sentence imposed, perhaps merely as a mark of public disquiet, should be served concurrently and not consecutively.<br><br>
I hope that the elucidation at the beginning of my remarks has helped the Committee, as they have helped me. I hope also that the Committee understands the point of amendment No. 302 and, having understood, will give its commendation.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1163</span>
<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairhairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always admire the fertility of the hon. Member's mind, but I must say that the word "sclutter" is not one which I had previously heard. It is one that I should be happy to have invented. I take it that it is something to which we have just listened. During the course of his sclutter, the hon. Member explained accurately the implications of the clause.<br><br>
The fundamental change which is made—I hope I shall not incur your wrath, Mr. Gourlay, if I explain it—is that if the clauses are passed, the options for a young person who has to be detained will be, as the hon. Member says, a period of detention in a detention centre or a period of determinate detention in a young offenders' institution. The indeterminate sentence of borstal training will not exist although the concept of borstal training will continue to be a part of the regime available in young offenders' institutions. It is the indeterminacy of the sentence that disappears.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I cannot help it if intelligent members of the public wish to go to the library to see what the word "sclutter" means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should remind the Committee, because it has happened on more than one occasion, that we are not aware that there are any persons in the room other than members of the Committee and the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Could something be done about the blinds? There are advantages in not being able to see the Solicitor-General, but if the blinds could be dropped by about another foot it would be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Shakespeare said, in the dark
<br><blockquote><p>"how easy is a bush supposed a bear",</p></blockquote>
but I am neither a bear nor a bush.<br><br>
Previously in the law, if someone was sentenced to a detention centre, he had to serve three months—no more, no less— with no remission. We have introduced a provision whereby a person may be sentenced to a detention centre for a period between 28 days and four months. The period which he serves there can be of any length within that period and is subject to remission.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1164</span>
If we were to accept the amendments, various changes would occur. First, we would return to the rigidity of a three month sentence. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has not explained his point of view. He says that he is suspicious of the whole matter, which does not surprise us, because he is suspicious of punishment of any kind. The point of the present three months sentence is that it is the mandatory sentence. When the hon. Member suggests reducing it, he appears to be forgetting that we now have a flexible sentence, as opposed to a mandatory sentence in a detention centre. I think the alternative is preferable. It leaves a flexibility of three months, between 28 days and four months, subject to remission. If we were to accept the amendments, a person sentenced to a detention centre would say to himself, "Right, for a start I shall not pay any of the outstanding fines. It will become a concurrent sentence, therefore I need not bother to pay them."<br><br>
One of the difficulties of the law, as the hon. Member will know, is that where someone is sentenced to a period of detention—at whatever age—and he has outstanding fines which can just become concurrent, one is opting out of a punishment. It is therefore important that a person should not be able to opt out of a fine merely because he happens to have been detained for something else. Therefore the option of making it concurrent or consecutive should be open to the court to judge in the circumstances of each case.<br><br>
It is the Government's opinion that it would be silly, where a person had been sentenced to a period in a detention centre, to transfer him to a young offenders' institution for a period of imprisonment in lieu of paying a fine which happened to occur after he had been sentenced to a detention centre. It therefore seems more sensible that if a period of up to 28 days were to be imposed concurrently, the sentence should be served in the detention centre.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden asked what would happen to somebody sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 28 days. In the Bill, if we have done nothing else, we have demonstrated that we are anxious that detention should be reserved for appropriate cases. The only situation in which I can imagine a person of this age being sentenced to a period of detention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1165</span>
of less than 28 days for any offence would be for default on payment of a fine. It might happen where a person who was a witness refused to give evidence and was sentenced perhaps to 14 days for contempt of court, but I think it unlikely. But it is because it is so unlikely that anyone would be sentenced to a period of imprisonment, except for default on a previous sentence of a fine, to a period below 28 days, that we can see that no period of less than four weeks would be an appropriate sentence in a detention centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that on the very minor amendment, No. 301, the Solicitor-General for Scotland is, in fact, giving me very strong support. He will appreciate that that amendment omits the words
<br><blockquote><p>"for a period of less than 28 days"</p></blockquote>
but does not omit
<br><blockquote><p>"other than by way of sentence".</p></blockquote>
Although I remarked about the fine substitution effect, the amendment strikes only at the ability to impose a consecutive sentence of less than 28 days as a first sentence after an offence has been committed. If the Solicitor-General for Scotland is saying that it is almost inconceivable that that would ever be done, why not omit it, as amendment No. 301 proposes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that not an unattractive concept. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to look further at the effect of the amendment, I shall reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to probe the mind of the Solicitor-General for Scotland a little further on the four months' sentence that he mentioned.<br><br>
We should concede at once that on amendment No. 301 at least the Solicitor-General for Scotland has come some way in agreeing to look at the matter. But he spoke about the four months' sentence being subject to remission. Would it not therefore be the case that whereas at the present time the sentence of three months is the determinate sentence and is not subject to remission, if we work on the basis that prison sentences usually attract a third remission for good behaviour, a four months' sentence would result in a sentence longer than the present three
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1166</span>
months' determinate sentence? Is that not the case? Any court that sentences a youngster to four months in one of these establishments would, in fact, be sentencing that youngster—assuming that he attracted the full remission—to three months and a week. It certainly would be greater. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) says "No" as well. But my understanding is that prison sentences attract remission at the rate of a third of the sentence for good behaviour. Therefore a four months' sentence would produce two months— [<i>Laughter.</i>]I think our arithmetic is all a bit wrong this morning.<br><br>
The real substance of the point I want to make is the comparison that was drawn upon when these short sharp shock sentences were introduced. I remember the Home Secretary, when he was Shadow Home Secretary, saying that what he hoped to introduce, if ever he had the chance, was something along the lines of the Army glasshouse. I found that very interesting and I have done some research into how the Army glasshouse, known as the corrective training establishment, operates. My understanding is that under the Army Act the maximum period—and here we are talking about adults—that can be served in one of these corrective training establishments is only 80 days.<br><br>
Far from the Home Secretary drawing on the example of the corrective training establishments used by the Services, he has gone way beyond the situation that prevails in Service life. There could easily be a case where a young man in the Army committing an offence—provided it is not an offence committed in "civvy street" but an Army offence which is somewhat similar to the offences for which some of our youngsters are up before the courts.<br><br>
Two young men could be in similar situations, but one could not in any circumstances serve more than 80 days in a Service corrective training establishment, whereas—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman with the techniques of advanced mathematics. If one assumes that there are 30 days in a month, and that therefore four months is 120 days, two-thirds of four months works out as 80 days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is assuming that the boy has earned full
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1167</span>
remission. We are talking about the maximum sentence, not about how long would be served if the maximum sentence were passed but the boy earned remission.<br><br>
The Home Secretary told the country that the corrective establishments would be modelled on the Army glasshouse. In fact, although the treatment may be modelled on that in the glasshouse, it has been decided to impose more severe sentences than the Services are permitted to pass on youngsters under the Army Act. There is a strong case for the Solicitor-General to consider amendment No. 300, which would reduce the maximum sentence from four to three months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are not the Government saying that if a boy in detention behaves impeccably, perfectly, the most that he can achieve is to be treated no worse than in an Army glasshouse, by having his sentence reduced to 80 days?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend has put it much better than I. No one is entitled to remission; it is decided by other people. I know of many prisoners who considered themselves model prisoners yet forfeited a number of days' remission. Prisoners can be sent up on report before the governor in the morning, and the normal punishment for that is loss of so many days' remission. I have no doubt that because prison officers are being given the impression by Parliament that they should treat the youngsters roughly, every effort will be made to ensure that the full period of the sentence is served.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that the person who is likely to get remission is the healthy, fit young person who can survive such a regime reasonably comfortably, as opposed to the unfit, flabby youngster who cannot cope with a three-mile run every morning, and cannot keep up? That would be for physical reasons—nothing to do with good behaviour. Such a person may lose remission simply because he cannot run three miles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Remission is a highly questionable consideration. No one who has had anything to do with the Scottish penal system would argue that the remission system is infallible. I do not dispute, of course, that it is valuable in helping to manage prisoners and in giving them something to aim at.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1168</span>
I have two points to make about the corrective training establishments on which the establishments in question are to be based. The first is that the maximum sentence—not necessarily the period that may be served—in one establishment is different from that in the other, on which it is supposed to be based.<br><br>
My understanding has always been that a sentence expressed in days rather than in months or years attracts no remission. Someone sentenced to 30 days, for example, serves the full 30 days. We should know the exact details. I think that the Solicitor-General is taking the matter a little too lightly. A number of serious points have been raised and must be cleared up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, my understanding of the law has always been that a sentence of 30 days or less attracted no remission, but I think he is wrong in saying that that is because it is expressed in days. It is rather difficult to say that a person shall go to prison for four weeks and two days. A period of 60 days in prison, for instance, attracts remission.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for confirming that a period of 60 days in prison attracts remission. That has not been my understanding up to now, and clearly that was a misunderstanding on my part. The Solicitor-General has in effect said that there is no question of remission for a youngster sentenced to 28 days in a detention centre. That point has been cleared. Only those sentenced to three or four months in the detention centre would be entitled to be considered for remission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That means that someone sentenced to six weeks—anything between 28 days and four months is possible— would be entitled, under what the Solicitor-General said, to remission. If he were a good boy and obtained full remission, he would serve the same sentence as the person doing 28 days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The mathematics of my hon. Friend, who has been a lecturer, are immaculate, and I rest my argument on what he says. But I hope that the Solicitor-General will take up some of these serious points because we are moving into a new regime in the penal system. We are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1169</span>
talking about criminal law but about the penal system. It is better that people understand what that will mean. I hope that the Solicitor-General will say why it was thought necessary to give the courts power to impose more severe sentences than can be imposed in the corrective training establishments in the Forces, on which we are told the detention centres have been modelled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in talking about the amendments, as I hope that we shall have a stand part debate.<br><br>
There is some difficulty for the Opposition in discussing these amendments. If we did not know that underlying the Government's words in the clause on detention centres and the treatment of young offenders was the short sharp shock treatment, we might have welcomed the measure as a way of reducing the period served by young offenders in detention or corrective training.<br><br>
I therefore welcome the amendment to reduce the period for which the sentence can be imposed, for at present it is a greater period than that imposed in the Army. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) introduced that fact; I should not have known it otherwise. It means that the young person will get harsher treatment than that which a hardened soldier might get for an offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) becomes too wound up in his military analogies, I hope that he appreciates that under the Bill proposed by the previous Labour Government it would have been possible for a young offender to be sentenced to two years' detention and to serve it in a detention centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and it supports the point I would make. I would never have approved, and would not approve, of such sentences. But what worries us is the linking of the period of time with the regime to be undergone by these people. If the detention centre were to be genuinely rehabilitative, if people there were to be treated as individuals in their own right with the specific problems that had taken them there in the first place, and if there were to be an attempt to solve
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1170</span>
each person's problems on an individual basis, a longer period might be acceptable. We know, however, that the period of detention will be served under a blind, harsh regime which takes no account of individual differences and needs, and we therefore have to say that the shorter that period can be, the better. That is why I support my hon. Friend's amendments which would make it possible to reduce the length of time served.<br><br>
I should like to elaborate on the calculations that I made. It is worth pointing out that someone who is sentenced to 28 days' detention gets no remission. He must serve 28 days, however good or bad he is under that regime. Someone who—presumably because he was a naughtier boy than the person who was sentenced to 28 days—is sentenced to six weeks will, if he is good, get two weeks' remission, or one third of six weeks. He will then be serving four weeks, or 28 days—exactly the same sentence as the other offender. The boy who is serving 28 days gets no such remission. He will serve his full sentence, come what may. That seems to me to be slightly unfair. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will consider whether remission might be possible for the person who is detained for 28 days.<br><br>
I shall welcome any amendments that will reduce the period served in the harsh penal detention that the Government are intent on pushing through, despite all the evidence that it does not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply very briefly, Mr. Gourlay. It has always been thought that remission was irrelevant in a period of less than 30 days. One may say—as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) says—that it is unfair that if I am sentenced to 28 days and he is sentenced to six weeks, and he is good, we shall both serve the same sentence, but I am afraid that that anomaly has always existed. It arises from the fact to sentence someone to 28 or 30 days and then give him remission has always been thought to be silly. That anomaly exists in the law at present and has always existed, because remission is not thought appropriate on a period of 30 days' imprisonment.<br><br>
The provisions in the clause mean that there is flexibility in the time for which a young offender is sent to a detention centre. With remission, the maximum period that can be served is less than the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1171</span>
statutory three months that is presently served in a detention centre. I have reminded the hon. Gentleman of the power of that ogre the Secretary of State. Under the Labour Government's Bill, if a person was sentenced to two years' detention and the Secretary of State thought it appropriate that he should serve the sentence at Glenochil, he would serve the sentence at Glenochil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Solicitor-General for Scotland not accept that clause 37 of the Labour Government's Bill abolished all these institutions—the detention centres, the young offenders' institutions and the borstals? These institutions were to be called youth institutions. The whole system was to be as one and the allocation of the youngster would be done by those working within the system. The youngster would be moved from one part of the system to another as he progressed in his treatment.<br><br>
Therefore it was a youth institution approach, and there was no mention of the detention centres that we have in this Bill. Clause 37 has been misinterpreted by the Solicitor-General.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are told that
<br><blockquote><p>"a rose by any other name would smell as sweet".</p></blockquote>
Glenochil was to exist in the regime and, as the hon. Gentleman consistently explained, there would be youth institutions and youth institutions, and it would be decided which was the appropriate regime for a youngster. They would all be called youth institutions, but they would all be different. Let us not be deceived by that concept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a somewhat truncated debate in the sense that we have touched on a large number of wider issues, to which we shall certainly wish to return more fully. I listened carefully to what the Solicitor-General said on amendment No. 300. I appreciate his point about flexibility, and about the fact that we have cut 28 days out of any detention centre sentence initially by limiting the time to between 28 days and four months.<br><br>
But I feel that between 28 days and three months would still give an element of flexibility and of choice to the presiding sheriff. I hold firmly to the view that if one believes that this should be a short sharp sentence to bring someone up sharply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1172</span>
against the wickedness of his ways, as a corrective, three months—even with remission now—ought to be a sufficient time in which to achieve that end. Therefore, although I see the force of the Solicitor-General's argument, I would prefer a three months' to a four months' limitation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? This is not entirely relevant to what he is saying, but it might assist his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) if I give the accurate information that under rule 37 of the Prison (Scotland) Rules a prisoner may earn remission on any sentence exceeding 30 days, but cannot be released within 30 days. Therefore remission earned cannot start to be enjoyed until 30 days have elapsed. That is the reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Solicitor-General. I speak only for myself when I say that the Committee should attempt by voting to limit the possibility of a detention centre period to a maximum of three months. I propose to press that amendment to a vote.<br><br>
On amendment No. 301, the Solicitor-General argued my case more succinctly than I did. Although I believe that it might be better to take out both (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the amendment takes out only (<i>a</i>). I endorse the Solicitor-General's views that it would be quite wrong to impose a sentence of under 28 days as a disposal of first resort. I can see that it might be an alternative to the non-implementation of a fine or some such thing. But paragraph (<i>a</i>) envisages a sentence of under 28 days in response to a conviction for a specific offence. The Solicitor-General disposed of that matter summarily, if I may say so, as a possibility. I would not propose to press amendment No. 301 to a vote, but will he look at it to see whether on Report this paragraph might be taken out?<br><br>
Amendment No. 302 is one with which we should persist. It goes back to the argument about whether three or four months is sufficient, but in any event we have in subsection (5) a determined upper limit, above which presumably the Government feel that it is not useful to have someone in a regime of this kind.<br><br>
It is of the essence of a detention centre regime that the youngster is being taught a lesson, that he will come out with a bit of "smeddum"—if I may use another Scottish word—put into him, and that he will then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0696">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1173</span>
perform as a decent, law-abiding citizen. The important point is that he should start with a clean slate and not with the rather embittered feeling that he has had his sentence extended unnecessarily by the terms of the clause. I believe that any additional sentence should be concurrent and not consecutive.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
There is no likelihood of the Solicitor-General's fears being realised that people</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 35, line 12, after "centre", insert "or young offenders institution".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 304, in page 35, line 15, leave out subsection (6).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to move the amendment. I believe that we can have a useful debate in the course of which we may perhaps improve the education of the Solicitor-General. According to <i>The Scotsman</i> of the other day, he sees himself as a modern version of Renaissance man. I am sure that he reads his own press copy. It is stated there as large as life that he sees himself as a modern version of Renaissance man, quoting names like Caesar, Napoleon and Jefferson—very interesting Renaissance figures, if I may say so. I hasten to assure the Solicitor-General that words such as "smeddum" are good Renaissance words—Scottish Renaissance, of course, but still Renaissance. I hope that his mind will be broadened in the course of the next few days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the report mentioned by my hon. Friend the same one that indicated that the Solicitor-General was to take holy orders, and will you, Mr. Gourlay, advise him to take them up sooner rather than later?</span></p>

<p>will merely say "In that case we need not bother to pay our fines". The point is that if they sit in detention centres saying that, they will discover when they come out, of course, that they can then be given the alternative sentence. In my view, the Solicitor-General's fears are totally illusory.</p>
<p>I recommend amendments Nos. 300 and 302 to my hon. Friends.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be rather interesting but I am afraid it is not within the rules of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are informed by the same article that the Solicitor-General sees his mind as being like a "frozen pond". I was slightly alarmed when my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said that he intended to probe it, because probing a frozen pond can result in coming up with some very nasty slimy objects, in my experience.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 303 and 304 are very important and far-reaching amendments which we shall want to consider carefully, and I shall explain briefly what they are intended to achieve.<br><br>
As the Committee will appreciate from amendment No. 303, we are adding to the options open on a sentence of between 28 days and four months the possibility not only of a detention centre but of a young offenders' institution. In other words, we are leaving a broader option to the court during that period. Above four months, subparagraph (<i>b</i>) applies, and it must be a young offenders' institution. Amendment No. 304 would delete subsection (6), which would become redundant if amendment No. 303 were accepted.<br><br>
At first sight, it looks as though these are wrecking amendments, but they are not, and I shall explain why. They would not undo what the clause hopes to achieve in one respect. If we were to vote against
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
the whole clause in the clause stand part debate, the effect would be to return to a position where borstal training would be an option. If amendment No. 303 were carried, we would abolish borstal training. No doubt we shall discuss this on clause stand part, but that is why I have tabled the amendments rather than leave it solely to the stand part debate.<br><br>
I know from lengthy experience of dealing with prisoners that they like to know what time they will have to serve. When one goes down to a cell to see a client after he has been sentenced, one finds him calculating with his fingers and toes, or perhaps his calculator, what the remission will be and whether he will be home for his birthday, Christmas or his summer holidays. If the sentence is indeterminate, it breeds considerable discontent and difficulty in terms of the management of the offender.<br><br>
The important point about the two amendments is that they would achieve what I believe is common ground between me and the Solicitor-General and all members of the Committee, namely, the abolition of the old borstal training indeterminate sentence. It would also broaden the range of options that is open to the court, and in the area where at present only a detention centre is a possibility except in the specific, exceptional circumstances that are enumerated in subsection (6), it would be broadened to include a detention centre and a young offenders' institution. That seems an extremely valuable option that we should leave open.<br><br>
On clause stand part, we shall have a different range of arguments about the type of regime that should be carried out in the detention centres, and the validity of detention centre training anyway. I do not intend to address myself to those matters now because that would be taking far too broad a view of the amendment.<br><br>
Having said that, I ought to explain why I feel that we should allow a wider option to the courts in this reserve area of sentencing that is envisaged under clause 44. This argument will appeal to the Solicitor-General. First, the courts will have heard the case and the plea in mitigation—this was argued most eloquently by the Solicitor-General in relation to youth institutions and his opposition to them, and there is some force in his argument—and, all things being equal, there is value in giving the courts the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
widest possible range of options. The sheriff has heard the plea in mitigation, he will have all the facts at his disposal, including a social inquiry report, and at that stage there is nothing wrong in saying to him "We trust you to decide whether the Home Secretary's short sharp shock regime"—or indeed it might be the Home Secretary's short sharp plagiarised shock from the Solicitor-General—"is suitable for this offender or whether he should merely go to a young offenders' institution." I see nothing wrong in leaving that choice to the court if we are to depart from the original Labour Party proposal of the youth institutions, which I preferred as a general scheme, and which no doubt we shall discuss on clause stand part.<br><br>
Given that we are departing from that, and if the length of the sentence is to be left with the court, I do not see why there should not be an option as to the type of institution in which the sentence should be served. That was the entire logic of the Solicitor-General's lengthy and eloquent speech during the Labour Government's Bill. In a sense, the Tories are pre-empting the trial judge by saying, "It does not matter what you think. If you wish to give him anything between 28 days and four months, you must sentence him to a detention centre and, like it or lump it, you are stuck with it."<br><br>
Given that the clause is not revolutionary and does not depart from the present system of leaving these matters to the judges, I believe that we should be consistent and logical and trust the judges to take the decision. We should leave the option open to them.<br><br>
If the Solicitor-General for Scotland argues against that, he will metaphorically have to eat almost everything he said during debates on the similar part of the previous Labour Government's Bill. I am sure that he will remember what he said then and accept my argument.<br><br>
There is irony here. In effect, the clause reduces the length of sentence that the sheriff courts may impose on summary complaint. The Government seek to abolish borstal, where the average stay was about nine or 10 months, and to substitute a maximum period of six months for young offenders or four months in a detention centre.<br><br>
Anyone who has had to make a living in the sheriff courts will know that in a standard plea of mitigation one is trying to persuade a judge that borstal training
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
would not be the right sentence and that he should send one's client to a young offenders' institution. The reason is that the maximum sentence for a young offender is six months, which with remission is reduced to four months, whereas if he goes to borstal the period is nine or 10 months.<br><br>
In a desirable but perhaps un-Tory way, the clause ensures that on summary complaint someone between 16 and 21 years of age will have a much lower ceiling on his sentence than is possible under the status quo. That is fair enough. However, it is wrong to accept the second un-Tory argument contained in the clause—namely to limit the judge's discretion.<br><br>
Why should we limit the courts in this way? It may be that the detention centre is a useful addition. However, I do not think that anyone on the Opposition Benches has suggested that the introduction of the youth institution, the assessment centre would necessarily mean that the Glenochil regime would disappear from the range of options. I do not think that that has ever been suggested, and I would not argue for it.<br><br>
I argue strongly against a proposal that in a certain range of sentencing we may have only one regime. That is a peculiar concept. It muzzles the range of options open to the court, the social workers and society.<br><br>
The amendment is simple. I accept that we get rid of borstal. I am even accepting that there should be a special place for detention centres. I am not trying to abolish them. However, let us leave the judge with some range of options. Let us not crib, cabin and confine him to one sentence so that once he has decided on a custodial sentence he has no option. If the crime is such that the sentence will fall within the range set out in subsection (5), the judge will be able to try only one regime. There is inflexibility, rigidity and lack of choice in the range of options which I find totally unsatisfactory.<br><br>
This is not a personal attack on the Solicitor-General. I hope that he will not take it amiss. It is a comment on the whole approach of his Administration. I fear that there is no argued or reasoned penal policy assumption. There is no case for saying that only one regime can conceivably be appropriate for a boy between 16 and 21 years, and a sentence of up to four or five months.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
There is no penal or social work policy or logic in that approach, and I fear that it is advanced only because it is a politically convenient cosmetic change. It allows us to say that we shall be tough with young thugs, kick them where it hurts, bash them and drive them into the ground like tent pegs. All this will be said by Conservative spokesmen who climb on to the law and order platform, as they so frequently do.<br><br>
I do not deny that there may be a place for the tougher physical regime of a detention centre, but surely it cannot be right to make it the single exclusive regime for people in this age group and serving this length of flexible sentence. The motivation for the change is not the intellectual conviction that it will fit the bill for everyone. It is an attempt to represent to the electorate that we have a tough approach to crime. It is a political virility gesture, and as such it should be treated with scant respect by the Committee.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If young people are in trouble—we are dealing here with those between 16 and 21 years—we need to retain for the courts the most flexible range of options available. If we had proper reform, the panels would assess the right institutions. Whoever is ultimately disposing of the youngster in trouble must have available a flexible range of options. For example, the non-custodial options involve not merely the fine and the suspended sentence but a range of intermediate treatment areas and initiatives within the community to give support and help. We do not want to close down the options in a difficult area where solutions are so difficult to find. We must recognise that each case has to be argued on its merits and on the circumstances of the offender. We should leave as many doors open as may usefully be used by those who are to deal with and treat him.<br><br>
I take the greatest exception to the idea that we should limit the options in this way. It is bad for penal policy, bad for society and bad for the offender. We should reject it. The only conceivable case for it is one of political expediency on the part of Conservatives, who made generalised promises that they would get tough with everyone irrespective of individual circumstances. That is what is really behind this change, and I do not think it stands up to any logical examination.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the Solicitor-General will think again. I stress that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1179</span>
are not trying to rule out detention centres. We merely ask that the options for dealing with young offenders should remain. Discretion should rest with those who have heard the trial and, in this case, with those who have the reports. As the Solicitor-General has frequently argued in the past, they are in a position to decide.<br><br>
Why should he say to a sheriff "It does not matter what you know about who appears before you or what is in the report. Unless you can get him into the narrow, exceptional provisions in subsection (6) there is only one conceivable type of regime to which you can send him, and that is a detention centre, with all that that implies." Indeed, the regime may become even more intensified as administrative reforms within detention centres are spurred on by Conservative politicians.<br><br>
There is an enormously good case for amendments Nos. 303 and 304 and I hope that the Committee will consider them sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) sees himself as Renaissance Man—namely, in the person of Mr. Gladstone. He seems to be entirely intoxicated by the sound of his own verbosity. It seems strange to me that the hon. Gentleman should advance such an argument. It was a Labour Government that passed the criminal law legislation in England which forbids a person between 16 and 21 years to be sentenced to a period of imprisonment between six months and three years. The hon. Gentleman was not a Member in 1977 and so he did not vote for that measure, but there are those who surround him who did.<br><br>
That argument also sounds odd from one who voted for a measure that provided that the judge who considered the appropriate length of sentence should have no say over the institution in which the sentence was to be served. That was part of the Labour Government's Bill. It was schizophrenic lunacy to provide that the judge, if he thought that three months or 18 months was the appropriate sentence, should have no control over whether it was served in Glenochil, in an open prison, or in borstal training. If ever there was a fatuous proposal, that was one.<br><br>
The judge should know that he is deciding whether imprisonment or detention is the appropriate sentence. He knows that he has a choice if he considers detention to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1180</span>
appropriate on account of the seriousness of the offence. It is likely that it will be the first period of detention for the convicted person. The judge should ask himself "Does the offence merit detention? Does it merit a long period of detention, or does it merit a period of salutary experience?" If he takes the view that it is so serious as to merit a period of imprisonment of more than four months, he will send him to a young offenders' institution. If he takes the view that it merits detention but does not merit such a period, he will sentence him to the detention centre. However, if he takes the view that it merits detention but does not merit a detention centre, would it not be better that he should say to himself "If it does not merit detention centre, it does not merit detention at all. If it does not merit between 28 days and four months in a detention centre, does it merit detention at all?" The judge will have to decide that question and it will concentrate his mind on the issue.<br><br>
Surely that will appeal to the hon. Member for Garscadden, who is so fluent in arguing any case from either side, or backwards, and who voted to remove from the judge any choice on the means of disposal, except for length of sentence. Having voted for choice nil he is now arguing for choice maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What sophistry! It is consistent to say that a wide choice should be exercised in terms of institution not by the judge but by an assessment centre, which would try to tailor the treatment to the individual needs of the offender.<br><br>
That is an argument that I used in a previous sitting, and I shall continue to argue it, although I recognise that the Solicitor-General for Scotland does not accept it. It is an argument on where the choice should lie. This is an argument about whether there should be choice at all. We are not saying that the choice should be with the sheriff or with the assessment centre, but is the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that there is no choice at all and that in a certain area of sentencing it is detention centre full stop, and detention centre again and again and again? The two arguments are totally different. The hon. and learned Gentleman should not confuse them, and I believe that he is doing so deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could talk for hours on any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1181</span>
subject on any side and convince himself that he was being wise and sincere. Let us be clear that the judge has the choice under the provisions of the clause of not sentencing a person to a period of detention at all, sending him to a short period of detention in a detention centre, or detaining him for a longer period. He has a choice both of disposal and of the term, and that seems to me a great improvement on the previous legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to interfere in the private fracas that is going on. I had hoped that something would be said about the principles behind the clause, because I am involved in connection with the 1969 paper, which has been discussed.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General has got it wrong. In fact, the choice has been removed. The nature of the institution is related to the first determination by the judge of the length of sentence. Let us suppose that a judge has decided on imprisonment. He then decides on the length of time that society demands for the offence, but, having done that, he has no choice in the matter—he cannot decide on institution A or B.<br><br>
I am not convinced that the judge would be qualified to do that anyway. That was the reason for my 1969 paper. But at least some sort of option is allowed at present; in this clause none is left. It says that the time will determine the nature of the institution. That is where flexibility is lacking. The flexibility of the judge is another matter.<br><br>
Two things have been decided in respect of sentencing policy. One is that, through the Bench, society makes its decision about the nature of the offence. It may say "This offence is so serious that the sentence should be a long stretch of time." Once such a decision has been taken a second point arises. After society has decided on the offence and sentence it should also decide about the offender and his nature. That will determine what sort of institution will be used.<br><br>
Although we may return to the matter on Report, at present the only way that flexibility can be introduced is through my hon. Friend's amendment. Although I am not totally in sympathy with it, because I do not believe that judges are qualified to make such a decision—it is a second best solution—it allows some option. At present matters are determined entirely by what length of time it is felt the offence merits,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1182</span>
whether or not that is appropriate for the offender.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not underestimate the strength of subsection (6). If the court takes the view that,
<br><blockquote><p>"for any special reason, which the court shall state"—</p></blockquote>
except in the High Court—
<br><blockquote><p>"a young offenders' institution is a more appropriate place of detention",</p></blockquote>
it has the option of, for example, sentencing someone to three months in a young offenders' institution. The reason might be that he had previously been sent to a detention centre, and that would be inappropriate again, as it had not worked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a highly greatly limited subsection. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) refers to those who are "physically or mentally unfit" and paragraph (<i>b</i>) refers to "any special reason". That does not allow a clear option to a judge. There would have to be certain particular and peculiar reasons before the subsection could operate. Even then, it does not leave an option widely open.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General should accept my hon. Friend's amendment. I do not want to speak at length on the matter because I wish to dwell at length, on clause stand part, on the reasoning behind the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a useful amendment, which was meant to be helpful to the Solicitor-General. I preferred the solution found by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) in the previous amendment. But we must live in the real world; the Conservatives are in power at present. Given that they wish fully to retain sentencing in the courts, I want to make sure that the maximum amount of choice is available.<br><br>
There is a popular fallacy that the Conservative Party believes in choice and the Labour Party is opposed to it. In many ways the reverse is true. This is a rather specialised example. There is a different argument about whether, if someone is to be sentenced to a period of custodial detention, that is done by an assessment centre team or the sheriff. But the important point is that whoever has that remit should have the widest possible opportunity of finding the right solution for the offender's problems. That is what we are

trying to provide. I realise that there is an escape hatch through which a sheriff may scramble in somewhat undignified fashion if he wants to get out of the straitjacket of the Solicitor-General and his colleagues.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
It is proposed that the use of a detention centre can be avoided in exceptional circumstances. Under paragraph (<i>b</i>) the reason must be recorded; no doubt it will be scrutinised by sheriffs principal and the High Court, and so on, on occasions. That shifts the onus of responsibility and is a form of bullying.<br><br>
What one is saying to the sheriff is clearly "Do not dare do anything other than pass sentence to a detention centre. If you really want to wriggle out of it and make it really plausible, we might be</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1186</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak only briefly on these amendments because I gather that you have kindly agreed, Mr. Gourlay, that we may discuss the principle of the clause on clause stand part, and I hope to take part in that debate. I also wish to remind the Committee of the promise made by the Secretary of State on Second Reading, and by the Under-Secretary of State and the Solicitor-General during previous sittings of the Committee, that they would give serious consideration to sensible amendments that did not impinge on the principles behind the Bill. I believe that these three amendments fall into that category, and I hope that the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary will give them serious consideration.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) will not be upset to hear that the amendments were drafted not by me but by Lothian regional council. Notwithstanding that, I hope that they will find favour with some Conservative members of the Committee. They were drafted by the council not on its own behalf but on behalf of the social work profession, and they reflect the views of that profession. I understand that the social work profession has also made representations direct to Ministers and Conservative Back Benchers, and has specifically asked them to support these amendments. I hope that they will do so. The consultation has not been as extensive as I would have liked it to be, but I hope that it will have some effect.<br><br>
The purpose behind the amendments is to remove the mandatory requirement for the after-care of young offenders and to replace it with the power for local authorities to provide after-care if requested. The evidence of the social work profession—the Association of Directors of Social Work and the British Association of Social Workers—is that this should be done for two reasons. First, because of the major change proposed in the Bill for the type of treatment for offenders, the reasoning behind compulsory after-care has gone completely. It made some sense
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1187</span>
when it followed on from the previous type of training, but now there is no sense whatever behind it.<br><br>
The second reason is that, as the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, especially knows only too well, there are very limited resources in the social work department, and that will continue to be the case. I regret that as much as anyone. It is the view of the social work profession that a lot of time is spent ineffectively with mandatory after-care of offenders to whom it is no use whatever. It is a pointless ritual that they are required to carry out. They would like to concentrate their resources on those who are previous offenders for whom it would be effective.<br><br>
That is the motivation behind this series of amendments. They have the complete support of the social work profession, and I hope that the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary will give them serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I treat the amendments with respect and sympathy, it is not true to say that they have the total support of those connected with this matter, because the probation service, to give one example, is opposed to the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to know what the Solicitor-General means by that. Under the Social Work (Scotland) Act, we do not have a probation service. It may be that the probation service south of the Border has commented, but with generic social work we take our advice from the social work directors and the associations, and they are totally behind us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is still the National Association of Probation Officers, which is opposed to this. We do not all change our titles in coincidence with legislative language.<br><br>
The effect of the present schedule is to alter the law for various reasons, the first of which is that at present the period of aftercare is often unrelated to the period of detention, and is therefore unsatisfactory. Under the schedule, there will be one year's compulsory post-release supervision for anyone who has been sentenced to 18 months or more. There will be six months for anyone who has been sentenced to between six months and 18 months. There is a power for the Secretary of State to reduce the period of six months to three
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1188</span>
months in special cases if he regards it appropriate. That will save considerable time and resources of those who undertake after-care.<br><br>
I must emphasise that the form that after-care can take is applied intelligently by the after-care officer according to the needs of the case. One person may need much more if he comes from a broken home or has difficult circumstances. Another may have committed an offence which he is unlikely to repeat, and the degree of after-care is different. But it is important that a young person who comes out after so serious a matter as having been sentenced to more than six months should always have some after-care supervision. That is what the Government wish to achieve.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). However, the Solicitor-General has also to some extent convinced me. As the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree, however, the tragedy is that that admirable provision is more often breached than observed. I do not wish to go over ground already covered in other debates. I simply wish to emphasise that it is necessary to do more than merely recognise the importance of after-care. I am Sure that my hon. Friend and everyone else in the social work world would agree that ideally we should give that assistance and support. However, as has been pointed out, that is often totally impossible, because of the lack of resources made available to social work departments by government. I hope that that message will be coming back strongly from Ministers such as the hon. and learned Gentlemen, who are arguing in favour of retaining the statutory duty but who at the moment are not winning the battle to provide the resources to allow it to be properly carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not in the least convinced by the Solicitor-General. I thought when I was speaking earlier that there was some sympathy at least in the eyes of the Under-Secretary. I hoped that I should not become disillusioned with life by seeing pearls of wisdom falling upon stony ground—to use rather a mixed metaphor.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), said to me in an aside, I am suggesting that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1189</span>
after-care become discretionary rather than mandatory. The Solicitor-General is saying that it must be mandatory, that social workers must go through the ritual of giving after-care that takes up time and resources week after week and yet is totally ineffective. I hear some muttering from some of my hon. Friends to the effect that they want mandatory after-care to continue. That is up to them. However, my experience on a social work committee for a number of years is that social workers have to spend day after day, week after week, looking after people because they are required to do so, even though it has no effect whatsoever.<br><br>
No one could put that more eloquently than the Association of Directors of Social Work, which represents all the directors of social work in Scotland. [<i>Interruption.</i>] My colleagues will have an opportunity to speak on behalf of themselves or their relatives if they so wish. I can appreciate the problems that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) must have had on a previous occasion. The association says:
<br><blockquote><p>"As a result of these changes"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the other changes in the Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"there will be an effect on the residual after-care arrangements, and it is now unclear as to what after-care can achieve. The present arrangements derive from the now rejected concepts behind the present sentences, but no opportunity has been taken to put some of the Younger Report's ideas into effect. Any young offender released from custody, whatever the length of his sentence, may have need of help in achieving rehabilitation if motivated towards it, but there seems to be little argument for retaining the concept of mandatory after-care in the form in which it has been left by this Bill."</p></blockquote>
That form of after-care will tie up unnecessarily limited and important manpower. That manpower could be used not only to look after former offenders who really need it, but to help the mentally and physically handicapped and the elderly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is concerned, as I am, that we are now asking social work departments to carry out jobs for which there is inadequate funding. That is what has motivated what have been alleged to be my attacks against social workers. I have not attacked the social worker as such but the system that expects the social worker to carry out a job for which inadequate funding is available. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether that was what he was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1190</span>
saying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member does not propose to pursue that line of argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not. The hon. Gentleman is raising wider issues that, as you rightly say, Mr. Gourlay, are not relevant to the amendment.<br><br>
I was saying that in my experience there is nothing more disillusioning for social workers than to be asked, indeed required, to undertake supervision duties that they and their clients know are useless and that they find totally unsatisfying professionally, simply because those duties are required by Act of Parliament. I do not wish to be a party to the continuation of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that I sympathised with the point of view, but in my opinion a compulsory ritual seems basically to be fatuous. Indeed, the compulsory ritual of some people standing up to speak might be an example. I repeat that I have some sympathy for the proposals of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), and if he will seek to withdraw the amendment I shall reexamine the matter, not just because I prefer the hon. Gentleman to his hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) but because he presented his argument intelligently and briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What more can I say? In the light of those generous remarks and that clear and helpful assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an important part of the Bill. I believe the Solicitor-General will agree that it changes the concept of the treatment of young offenders as that has been known for a very long time in the penal system in Scotland, and no one should pretend otherwise.<br><br>
I make no apology for the fact that during the years when I was responsible for prisons in Scotland, and the period before and since, I have gone out of my way to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1191</span>
defend many of the youngsters of Scotland who, in my view, have not had a proper opportunity and have often found themselves in trouble for that reason. The first question to be asked is whether the provisions of the clause will reduce crime among youngsters and what sort of youngsters will be produced at the end of the day among those who eventually find their way into the sort of penal system proposed. The sort of youngsters that the system will produce will be those who regard it as something of a virility symbol to have served some time in one of the detention centres.<br><br>
I recall visiting the remand centre at Longrigend and meeting a youngster there whose great ambition in the world of crime was eventually to make his way to Peterhead. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who has great experience of these matters knows, that that is what happens. If a place like Longrigend produces that sort of situation, what will be produced by the detention centres?<br><br>
I forecast that one result will be that many youngsters who are habitual troublemakers will see it on the one hand as an ambition and on the other hand as an achievement to find their way into the detention centres so that they can boast to their friends that they have done four months in Glenochil. The new short, sharp, shock sentences will do nothing to reduce juvenile crime—which is something we are all anxious to see reduced—but will produce a race of hard men from these youngsters. That will be the direct and dramatic effect of clause 44.<br><br>
We are talking about what develops when a youngster has been before a court and has been sentenced. I do not believe that those who operate the penal system understand how this system will work. I think that the Solicitor-General will have to describe how the system will work, because at present we have a three tier system—the borstal institutions, the young offenders institutions and the detention centres—for the treatment of youngsters between the ages of 16 and 21.<br><br>
That system of three tiers is being reduced to two. Nothing more nor less than the sentences passed by the court will decide the part of that regime in which the youngsters will serve their sentences. I do not quite share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden on the matter of borstal training, but I agree with him in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1192</span>
that I was never happy about indeterminate sentences.<br><br>
When a youngster was sentenced to borstal training it was never a sentence of one or two years, but was merely borstal training. The sentence was indeterminate. It is all right to say that on average a youngster served 10 months in a borstal and was then released, but, as the Solicitor-General rightly said in an earlier debate, it is daft to talk in averages when we are discussing such sentences. A number of youngsters served a great deal longer than 10 months, and some served less.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend that the indeterminate sentence had to be abolished, because it was bad. I accept any criticism that might be levelled at my part in this matter. I hope that the Committee will not accept that the kind of training that goes on in borstal institutions should be changed, because a youngster going to a borstal, certainly for a first custodial sentence, and going through the type of training that some of these institutions provide, could undoubtedly mend his ways. He could have the opportunity to rehabilitate himself in society.<br><br>
For me, one of the great attractions of the borstal training was the way in which some of the training took place in the community, outside the establishment. I shall not go into a large number of examples, but I can think of two in my constituency. At the Elgin Park leisure centre for the mentally handicapped all the real nawying work on the building was done by youngsters from the Polmont institution. I can remember going round the building once on a Friday, in torrential rain. The youngsters were still working away. When I asked one young lad who was standing in a hole in the ground, with water over his knees, what he was doing, he answered "I've got to get this drain disconnected the day, sir."<br><br>
Those youngsters were brought out to mix with people less fortunate than themselves—the mentally handicapped youngsters for whom the centre was being built. One of the lads came back to the opening and said that until he had mixed with these youngsters he had not realised how fortunate he was.<br><br>
I hope that in the Government's new hardline approach such opportunities will not be allowed to go by the board. We have some good governors in the Scottish prison service. Charles Hills, who was the governor at Polmont at that time, in my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1193</span>
view gave an outstanding example of how to run a youngsters' institution. There is a link between the organisation known as the Six Circle Group and some of the borstal inmates.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will confirm that in this new hardline approach there will be no question of the type of community involvement that can do the youngster no end of good being stopped. That would be a disaster of the first magnitude and would do more damage than good.<br><br>
I turn to the manner in which the new system will work. At present all youngsters sentenced to a period of Borstal training go to the institution at Polmont. There they are assessed and allocated to the various institutions throughout the Borstal system. There are one or two in the constituency of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker)—for example, Castle Huntly, which has a marvellous engineering workshop. Clearly, if a youngster has the ability to be trained on the machinery, he will go there.<br><br>
I want the Solicitor-General to say whether it is the Government's intention to issue a circular to both the courts and the prison service to the effect that all youngsters sentenced to more than four months, and therefore going to a young offenders institution, will go to one institution—again, in this case, Polmont—for assessment and allocation to the various other young offenders institutions that make up the system. That is very important.<br><br>
I stand by my argument on clause 37 of the Labour Government's Bill. The court is undoubtedly the only and best body to consider the evidence and pass the sentence. But I do not believe, nor has anyone convinced me, that it is the best body to allocate the youngster to a particular institution. It does not happen in the case of adults. When an adult offender is sentenced to imprisonment, he goes to one of the prisons, where he is assessed and allocated, not by the court, but by a committee of prison officers.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
A degree of flexibility should be available to the prison authorities in the allocation of youngsters once they have been disposed of by the court. Anything else would be, first, unworkable and secondly, unacceptable. I do not believe that it should be in the power of the courts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1194</span>
to say that a youngster should go to Castle Huntly, Polmont or Montrose. It is worth holding on to the present system of assessment and allocation. I hope that the Solicitor-General will confirm that.<br><br>
I should like the Solicitor-General to develop his rather astonishing argument that a range of options is open to the court—that if the court decides that an offence is worthy of 28 days but not in a detention centre, the option is open to it not to sentence the offender to anything. We all know that no court that takes the view that someone should be detained will exercise an option such as that described by the Solicitor-General. In effect, if a court is in doubt whether an offence merits treatment in a detention centre, it will exercise the option to pass a heavier sentence and send the offender to the young offenders institution, not to the detention centre. Far from curing any problems, that will create many more.<br><br>
I shall conclude almost where I began, by forecasting that this measure will do absolutely nothing to reduce juvenile crime in Scotland, but will produce a race of hard youngsters who will regard it as an achievement to get themselves into the detention centres for short, sharp shock treatment. They will regard it as a virility symbol. I advise my hon. Friends to vote that this clause should not stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has said. I am appalled that the Government should make such proposals, and I am sorry that the Government in Scotland have been persuaded by the Home Secretary—as clearly they have—to introduce this measure into the Bill. We need a new approach to juvenile crime. We should take account of the fact that young people between the ages of 16 and 21 are a special category. They are certainly a special category in regard to crime, because that age group has a high rate of offence, and of both conviction and reconviction.<br><br>
There is little evidence to support punitive sentencing as envisaged in clause 44 of the Bill. There is little evidence that either short or long sentences deal with the problems of crime, and research has not produced any firm conclusions on which to base firm proposals of this kind. There is little hard information about the causes of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1195</span>
juvenile crime. We could argue that the urban condition and environment in our great cities are contributory factors. Unemployment is certainly a contributory factor, and there is an alienation among our young people from a society which is aggressive and indifferent to their conditions.<br><br>
We should tackle the causes of juvenile crime rather than endeavour to satisfy popular demands. I concede that there are popular demands for what is being proposed, but that does not make it right. No thoughtful and considered conclusion has been reached on how to approach this serious social problem. The short sharp treatment on the Whitelaw principle will not work. There is little evidence that it will work, and it is overwhelmingly punitive. It is aimed at satisfying what might be called the primitives of Perthshire and the Tory Party conference.<br><br>
It would be fair to the hon. Member who represents that constituency to say that many of the delegates to the Tory Party conference come from his constituency— but none the less, primitive they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Piltdown man rather than Perthshire man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Piltdown certainly. The simple solutions that were proposed last year at the Tory Party conference, and the robust applause with which they were received, filled me with concern and worry, because I do not think that they offer any help towards solving complex social issues. The Home Secretary's own Department reached certain conclusions in the 1950s when there was a review of penal policy and consideration was given to the short sharp shock treatment. It is not a new proposal. The concept of punishment has been with us for a long time. It will occur to someone, sooner or later, that we have had punishment for all that time and that it does not appear to be effective.<br><br>
In the 1950s the Home Office came to the conclusion that there is
<br><blockquote><p>"no evidence to show that reconviction rates are improved by longer sentences, shorter sentences, or alterations in regime of any kind so far attempted. On the contrary, such evidence as there is suggests that these factors are irrelevant as far as reconviction rates are concerned.”</p></blockquote>
That is an important observation on the part of the Home Office. We must look at different ways of treating offenders and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1196</span>
find the causes of crime. If that requires a great deal of research and money, I am willing to enter into all those commitments. That would be a proper course of action. The measures proposed here have no record of achievement behind them and we can expect no improvement in accepting clause 44.<br><br>
The Tory Party will take refuge in the fact that more people will be brought within the courts and into detention. There is no doubt about that. If the powers of search and detention become law and the Conservative argument is right, more people will be apprehended. We already have experience which shows that the measures will add to the number of young people in detention. Whether that is considered a good thing depends on the side of the House on which one sits. But even if that happens, it will not represent an improvement in the social condition. It will only tell us that the problem exists in volume, whereas we ought to be finding out what causes the problem.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) made a statement—which, as I understood it, was supported by the directors of social work—on the issue of mandatory after-care. I have some sympathy with the arguments that he advanced. Undoubtedly the Government are reducing the capacity of social work departments to discharge their statutory remit. There is no doubt about that. That is exactly what is happening. But I should be extremely reluctant to reduce the statutory requirements of the service because of that situation. That is not a position which I could defend.<br><br>
The Government must meet their obligations. The Social Work (Scotland) Act, and other statutes which place obligations on social work departments, should be met. I do not want to see a reduction in the service, or its responsibilities, simply because the Government choose to behave in a thoroughly irresponsible way towards the social problems facing the country. That is why I would not have supported my hon. Friend but we avoided a schism, I am pleased to say, and he remains my hon. Friend.<br><br>
I do not know what the Government will do, but I shall watch what happens, because in no way shall I ever support a reduction in the responsibilities of social work departments. That is why I cannot support my hon. Friend on this occasion.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your assistance.<br><br>
I shall oppose this provision, for the reasons that I have given, and I hope that all my hon. Friends will do likewise.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the view, contrary to some hon. Members, that there are no simple, easy answers and soft options. The problem is not simple and easy to solve. The complex problems which have produced the shocking and staggering level of crime in Scotland worry all of us. Anyone who really imagines that we can wave a magic wand and find a solution is living in cloud-cuckoo land.<br><br>
We have a duty seriously to explore all the avenues. Many of us who have spent all of our adult life—this includes myself—actively involved in youth work know that there is no easy solution. We recognise that it is far better if something can be done before the individual goes off the rails. It is important to catch offenders as early as possible, as soon as they have gone off the rails. That has been my experience, and I have run youth clubs in some of the toughest, roughest areas in the country. I assure the Committee that if one gets young offenders early and deals with them quickly, it can be effective.<br><br>
I welcome the clause, and I want to comment on what I consider to be the sensible views expressed by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). It is not often that I can say that in Committee, because the hon. Member and I do not usually agree, but I agree with him that the matter of after-care and the burden of social work departments is one that we should not brush over lightly. It has to be considered.<br><br>
Reference has been made to Castle Huntly. I confirm that it is in East Perthshire. I have been there frequently and have taken an interest in what is going on. The individuals working there on behalf of the Government do so in a dedicated manner and attempt, within their resources, to do the best possible job. But I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1198</span>
acknowledge, as I have always acknowledged, that we must change with changing times and, because this clause is a genuine endeavour to meet the needs of today, I support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My past keeps catching up with me on this Bill. Mention has been made of the 1969 paper, and I shall briefly refer to it in the context of this clause. First, however, I quote the Solicitor-General:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ugly people or places can bring me to the point of pain. When I see a painful, discordant shape I find it incomprehensible that it could ever have been created."</p></blockquote>
That is his reaction to the kind of regime, presumably, that the clause is designed to create. The article from which I took that quotation says:—
<br><blockquote><p>"Twelve paintings of horrendous Chinese torture hang behind his head. Skilful perhaps, but beautiful …? Why does he like them? 'Oh, they are Section One of the Criminal Justice Act'."</p></blockquote>
If that is a description of section 1, what on earth would the Solicitor-General draw in aid to illustrate his view of section 37?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman cannot imagine that the Solicitor-General would make the mistake of calling a Bill an Act and a schedule a section.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The mind boggles—and I can spell it.<br><br>
The problem with the clause, as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said, is that there is no single simple solution. I think everyone is agreed on that. All the evidence suggests that, no matter the length of sentence, no kind of regime so far attempted has had any real effect on the problem of recidivism. Very few regimes have been shown to be rehabilitating.<br><br>
That does not mean that the search for a solution should not continue. The problem with the clause is that it pre-empts the search for other solutions. If the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire is saying that there is no single, simple solution, I agree with him. The trouble with the clause is that it is bringing forward as the only solution a penal solution, with the two options being the detention centre and the young offenders' institution. Even with that, allowing no flexibility, the determination will be made by the length of sentence given. Therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1199</span>
solutions, in fact, were blocked at the beginning.<br><br>
We all know that that provision originated from a Tory Party conference. I saw it being originated when, in response to demands from the floor, the Home Secretary said "This is what we will have— the short, sharp, shock routine"—and everyone cheered. Now there is a single, simple solution, but it is a single, simple solution that has also been tried. I have seen it and I was horrified by what I saw. I am told that, according to a publication called <i>Cast Iron,</i> everything is done at the double in an atmosphere of nervous tension and sergeant-major bullying. I thought that I had stopped that, but apparently it continues. The regime is of no value. There is no evidence of any large-scale or even significant improvement. Also, it is an affront to the prison service that it should have this regime imposed upon the officers as well as upon the young people.<br><br>
One document says of prison officers:
<br><blockquote><p>"And they ceased of themselves, to operate 'short, sharp shock' regimes because from ordinary humanity, prison officers were unwilling in sufficient numbers to take on the role required, precluding as it does any pretension to helping or caring. (It is hard on officers to be hard on prisoners; it is not their job to treat inmates harshly; being in prison is punishment enough.)"</p></blockquote>
The last part of the quotation comes from the Fifteenth Report of the Expenditure Committee, 1977–80.<br><br>
Along with that imposition of duties upon the prison officers and the lack of any purpose or intention behind this, beyond the punitive or retributive, is the effect it will have not only for the future in the virility symbol aspect as demonstrated by my hon. Friend, but in the lack of value within the regime. There are figures for the Glenochil detention centre, which has 150 detainees, and where there is hard, monotonous domestic work and, of course, hard physical exercise. Out of the population of 150 detainees, 14 were listed as doing cooking and baking. Twelve worked in the laundry, and the rest, apart from 11 non-effectively employed, were described as cleaning the halls. Contrast that with the work described by my hon. Friend for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) within the borstal regime. Inadequate as we accept it to be—and in the previous Labour Government's Bill we wanted to get rid of the borstal regime—nevertheless, positive work could be done and, above
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1200</span>
all, work that involved the young people, not only with the disciplinary officers and the other officers within the service, but with people outside able to perform a service to the community.<br><br>
It is difficult to get those figures exactly, so I am not sure how reformative that has been. I can only say that on first principles and common sense it at least introduces these young people to other people who appreciate what they were doing. If they cannot leave their life of crime after being in contact with people who appreciated what they were doing in a positive way, no amount of contact with those whose function is merely to discipline them will produce that effect.<br><br>
In the alternative method there is hope of progress. All the evidence suggests as my hon. Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland says, that this method creates a permanent hardened core of youngsters.<br><br>
Thirdly, quite apart from effectiveness, almost <i>per se,</i> the clause should be rejected. Society does three things when it sentences young people. One of them is that responsibility is imposed on society for the rehabilitation of young people. We impose that on ourselves. We expect to be our brother's keeper in that sense.<br><br>
The two other aspects were well put by BASW—the social workers. It takes the starting point of the regime and the purpose behind a criminal justice clause of this kind.<br><br>
It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are two main questions of principle. One is the degree of determinancy expressed by the courts in sentencing against the desire of the executive—in this case the prison authorities—to a flexibility in allowing for the individualised rehabilitation of offenders."</p></blockquote>
It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the mounting evidence about the total failure of all the custodial institutions for the young to significantly affect the future behaviour as against the much greater need for a shift towards treatment within the community."</p></blockquote>
Those are the two matters with which we have to deal here. The clause blocks up the degree of determinancy by refusing even the bench a great degree of determinancy and rejecting the right of the prison authorities, and those who have the responsibility for care, to make decisions on the individual rehabilitation of offenders.<br><br>
I turn to the purpose of the 1969 paper. I was surprised to see references to this because it seems that one's past catches
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1201</span>
up with one. I was responsible for that paper and did not know that we had published it. However, I spoke to my successor as Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about the paper and its content. Although it was not implemented between 1970 and 1974, I do not think I am giving any secrets away when I say that the hon. Gentleman was in favour of the proposals contained therein as general principles.<br><br>
Those proposals were saying "Yes, it is right for the courts to sentence. Yes, it is right for society to say 'That is an offence and we have to make a judgment about the degree of that offence by the nature of the sentence we make', but as well as the offence and its nature there is also the nature of the offender."<br><br>
I thought that the Solicitor-General for Scotland made the best speech I have heard him make in Committee—perhaps the best speech since he has been in the House—when he said that he understood that in relation to murder and serious violence there was a difference between the offence and the nature of the offender. However, above all, when considering young people we must be concerned with the nature of the offender.<br><br>
Therefore society does two things. It says "This is our view of the offence." Then the bench passes the sentence upon it. But society must also say "This is our view of the offender." We must therefore create the kind of situation, whether within the community and not under penal care, or within penal care with a flexibility of the kind of institutions in which the offender can be dealt with.<br><br>
In most cases it is better solved outside penal care altogether. There is everything to be said for cutting back on the number of young people sentenced. In most cases that should be the response of society, however society judges the offence at the point of sentencing.<br><br>
There is something to be said for saying that the existence of the institutions adds to the number sentenced to go to these institutions because the bench and the courts are not then forced to deal with other possible solutions.<br><br>
As we have found with motorways, when they are built the traffic that uses them increases. I believe that the same thing happens in relation to prisons and other penal institutions. The more there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1202</span>
are, the more likely we are to increase the numbers in them. The courts and the Government are not then faced with the necessity of finding other alternatives.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
It was on that kind of thinking, largely by officials in the Scottish Office, but initiated at a meeting when there was present a large representation of governors, Lord Kilbrandon, the sheriff and a large number of people. That meeting ended with the solution that society makes the judgment and sentence in relation to the offence, but from that point the young offender passes into the care of the Executive, the prison and other authorities.<br><br>
In order that the treatment can be tailored for the particular offender, an assessment centre is required at which both the offence and the offender could be looked at, and a variety of institutions could be created, some of which would have to be tight, and some security-controlled, but many of which could be open, to which some could be shifted if necessary. In other words, all need total flexibility on the placing of individuals including the placing of individuals not in penal circumstances but in need of treatment within the community.<br><br>
That was the basis of clause 37 of the Labour Government's Bill. That is what this Government should have continued, as it brought the possibility of a solution. They have accepted one aspect and got rid of the indeterminate sentences. We approve of that. There is nothing worse psychologically for the inmates of institutions than a lack of knowledge about when they will get out. There is the knowledge that the slightest peccadillo—and we all commit numerous peccadillos—would lead to a lengthening of the sentence. But having disposed of the indeterminate aspect, the Government have now imposed a rigid and inflexible structure of which the keynote is the short sharp shock.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, this is even worse that the glasshouse concept in the Army. But there was a little justification for that concept because it is within a hard discipline, within a society which is already an authoritarian disciplined society. In the Army, offenders are infringing the discipline which is necessary in the Army, and the way forward is to discipline them further to continue within that discipline. But that is not what we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1203</span>
training our young offenders for. We are not training them to continue to be proper inmates of an authoritarian society of that kind. We are training them to be able to make their own judgments freely in the society that they will enter afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentlemen's point, but does he accept that the glasshouse was a deterrent and that it worked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given the reasons for that—they were leaving the glasshouse to go into another authoritarian disciplined regime. The society into which they were moving maintained the attitudes and morality of the glasshouse but with less severity. In other words, it was not continuous punishment, but there was authoritarianism and control.<br><br>
I was in the Army for four years in an apparently controlled authoritarian society. There is all the difference between that and saying to somebody "You have got to have this imposed on you in order to maintain and to be maintained within a discipline".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say to my hon. Friend that he may have given the best possible example that the strict discipline, authoritarian system of the Army does not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend was going to accuse me of being part of the process of inflicting discipline. I went through four years and I did not get a single stripe, the reason being that I was about to go to a War Office selection board. I edited the regimental war magazine, and two things happened. After its first issue it was banned, and I was sent immediately to North Africa and remained there. I do not know what happened to the War Office selection board vacancy. No doubt someone occupied it.<br><br>
I have made my point throughout. I merely wanted to say that that is the distinction between the glasshouse regime in the Army and that in which we have to train people to be free citizens in a free society. In many ways it is worse. That was an 80 days' punishment within the glasshouse, but we have the prospect of making the 80 days' punishment possibly only for someone serving a four months' sentence if he has behaved impeccably, in which case it is reduced to 80 days, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1204</span>
same as in the glasshouse.<br><br>
I shall oppose the Bill not because I wish to return to the previous form, which is what will happen, but because if we reject it there will still be an opportunity to bring in another clause on Report to replace it—one which is based on the establishment of youth institutions which can be flexible and tailored to the requirement of the individual. I hope that Conservative Members, who I know in their hearts reject the short sharp shock, and who had the courage to reject the same kind of treatment in relation to murder at our last sitting, will join with us in rejecting the clause now, so that we may begin to find the right kinds of solutions instead of preempting them in this punitive, reactionary and backward way. Penal reform would be set back years if the clause were allowed to remain in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I begin by asking the newspapers not to print something that occurred in a Standing Committee but I plead with them and hope that they are unable to find a space for the comments made earlier by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) in my support. That would increase my difficulties. My constituents would not understand the subtleties of the approval that he was giving me.<br><br>
My second remark concerns the literary and artistic allusions that have been drawn regularly about the Solicitor-General. I was not intending to make that allusion. I was thinking that his position and role were somewhat more Gilbertian than Renaissance, because his appearance is somewhat more that of the Mikardo and his role much more that of the Lord High Executioner who first brought us the concept of the short sharp shock. I quote from The Mikado:
<br><blockquote><p>"To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock … Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock".</p></blockquote>
Nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity to discuss penal policy in relation to young people. What worries me is the fact that there is not much evidence on which we may base our discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has omitted in the rhyme the reference to life sentences. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock".</p></blockquote>
If he quotes Gilbert, I wish that he would quote him accurately.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1205</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my education was not as good as that of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). I have proved it most inelegantly today. I take this opportunity of welcoming him to our discussion.<br><br>
The debate lacks a lot of basic information. We have not had a consultative document about penal provision for young people. There is little statistical evidence. There appears to be little evidence that Ministers have consulted with those involved before bringing forward their proposals. There seems to be somewhat more of a blind faith and a lack of reason behind what Ministers are suggesting.<br><br>
I wonder whether, during the course of the discussion, the Solicitor-General could give us some inkling of the thinking behind detention centres. All we hear is the rhetoric, the Home Secretary's conference presentations and the hurrahs of the crowds of behatted ladies at the Tory Party conference. We hear nothing about the underlying concept.<br><br>
If there is to be a very strict regime in the detention centres, with physical exercise and doubling everywhere, the kind of people—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative members of the Committee have made the point for me. That is something that, far from being a punishment, can be very good for one. I wonder whether, in choosing the kind of people who should be sent to the detention centres, the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary are thinking of these fit and active people. Are they thinking of trying to make them more fit, more active and more physically able to participate in the athletic activities that they might want them to take part in? If it is the philosophy of the Government to make these people more fit, more able, more physically active and more athletic, will the detention centre be a punishment? Does that square with the idea of punishing them that we keep hearing expressed by the Conservative ladies and gentlemen—or, as someone has said, the Conservative ladies of both sexes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Better than Socialists of neither.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that kind of punishment later, because it is relevant. But far from being a punishment, to send these fit and active young people to a detention centre of that type might be to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1206</span>
do them a favour. The only punishment they would suffer would be that when they reached Olympic standard they would not be allowed—for some spurious reason—to take part in the Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Might not the effect be—as has been pointed out in a brilliant cartoon—to make them fitter, so that they can beat up more old ladies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one possibility. What I am trying to point out—in a slightly lighthearted way—is that we have not been given the real thinking behind the Government's proposals. Are they proposing to send unfit, seedy or perhaps overweight individuals there, to fitten them up? But there is a serious point to be made here.<br><br>
I shall refer to Glenochil, since the Under-Secretary of State is here. I had occasion to write to him about one of my constituents who is detained at the Glenochil detention centre and who on all objective criteria—in my view, and in the view of all who know him—is manifestly not suited to such a centre. Yet he has been sent there and is suffering great hardship as a result. Is that the kind of punishment the Government want? We do not know what is the thinking of the Government. It may be that the Government would punish a masochist by telling him that he was not going to be allowed to go to Glenochil. The argument is similar to the argument we hear when we are discussing corporal punishment in schools. Arguing in favour of corporal punishment, Conservative Members say "Don't get so upset. Don't get so worried about the young people. They like it. They prefer it to any other form of punishment." Does one choose the punishment that young people prefer?</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am asking.</span></p>
