	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>this day</i>], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to note that the Under-Secretary of State has been translated—I was about to say promoted—to the end of the Government Front Bench. I had an opportunity of exchanging a brief word with him informally outside the Committee. He admitted—I do not think that he will mind my saying this—that what we are dealing with is not an easy matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was saying in a somewhat whimsical way when we adjourned has a serious underlying intention and concern. The Government are responsible for the matter. They are putting forward the Bill; they are putting forward the clause. They are reorganising the system for dealing with young offenders. But I am not clear about their understanding of the purpose of the system. Is it deterrence? Is it punishment? Is it treatment? What amalgam is it? How do they see the short, sharp shock acting as a deterrent? Will it really act as a deterrent to some people, who might find it a quite pleasant interlude? Will it be seen as real punishment? For some people it will, indeed, be a harsh punishment, if they are the wrong people—as I remarked about the constituent to whom I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, do the Under-Secretary and the Solicitor-General for Scotland share the Opposition's view—which my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) put so eloquently—that the purpose of the institutions in question is to provide treatment? They are there to try to rehabilitate people and to make them useful members of society, not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1210</span>
to equip them better to commit crime. To some extent, this short, sharp shock, this physical treatment, might, indeed, so equip them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to analyse this matter. I was thinking that a century or so ago there was hanging for sheep stealing. We do not have that penalty for sheep stealing now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—yet it is not evident that there is a great outbreak of sheep stealing in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets away with such rubbish, can he advise the Committee of a single case in which anyone was hanged for sheep stealing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably it was a deterrent. It did not necessarily have to be carried out. It is clear that there were such penalties—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot name cases, but during the seventeenth century—I am not sure about Scotland—whether or not they were hanged for sheep stealing, people were certainly hanged for offences of stealing as little as one shilling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be of interest what happened so many centuries ago, but if we keep to the present century we shall stay in order more easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be stretching a point, but one needs to understand what we are trying to do by the kinds of punishment that we have. In other countries, people such as the Ayatollah may find it appropriate to cut off people's hands for stealing. That, no doubt, makes it more difficult for them to do it again. When the Solicitor-General for Scotland was talking about sexless Socialists I had visions of that kind of punishment for other offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to rehabilitate people. There are many people who, through social circumstances, inadvertence, or because they are misguided by some group or other, get themselves into trouble. Many are intelligent, capable young people. Many have great potential and have much to contribute. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1211</span>
examples of such people becoming active in sport. There are many intelligent young people who, if rehabilitated, can be positive members of society. Surely the purpose of the young offenders institutions and even of the detention centres should be to try to rehabilitate people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that there was no evidence that Glenochil, the prime example of a detention centre being quoted not only by Ministers but by the Home Secretary, provides the short, sharp shock, after which the young people commit no more crimes. I have been looking at statistical evidence, and I accept that it is difficult to adduce anything from it. The purpose of Glenochil is to deal with first offenders and to try to give them a short, sharp shock at the beginning. If they offend again they are not sent back to Glenochil some other treatment is meted out to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who have received the submission from the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties which contains carefully researched evidence will know that the intake represented by reconvictions in Glenochil is higher than the average. Therefore, there is no evidence that Glenochil has the effect attributed to it by Conservative Members, and yet the Committee is being moved in that direction by the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about what will happen to the resources now at our call in the service. I hope that the Minister will tell us. There are a number of institutions throughout Scotland. There are trained staff experienced in particular skills. There are teachers, social workers and prison-trained staff attached to those centres. We need to know what is to happen to those institutions and how they and their staff will be deployed. We need to know what is in the Government's mind in relation to the future of detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to believe propaganda from the Government, slowly but surely all those institutions will be transferred to detention centres. That will become the norm in the majority of cases. That would have serious implications for the staff in those institutions. It could mean redundancies and problems about retraining of staff. I should like the Minister to tell us what discussions have taken place or are planned with the trade unions concerned. One of my hon. Friends said
	<span class='label label-info column'>1212</span>
earlier that it seemed as if staff were to be moved willy-nilly to a new kind of regime, or job, or contract of service. That will affect the staff as much as it will affect the inmates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that perhaps some members of staff, such as those who are highly trained in areas such as psychiatric nursing, will find it somewhat difficult to transfer to this kind of institution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend made that point. It highlights what I was trying to say. I was putting the matter in general terms, and he has brought it down to the specific. There are some good caring people, not particularly well paid or well recognised for their efforts, who are currently working very hard to rehabilitate people. There are craftsmen in painting, joinery and ironmongery, the psychologists, the social workers and others who may have great difficulty in adjusting to this new regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is being suggested may be seen as a few lines on a piece of a Green Paper here in a Committee room of the House of Commons overlooking the beauties of the Thames, but what it means in reality is a whole change in direction in the policy of treating young people in institutions in Scotland. There has been scant attention by the Ministers concerned to any discussions with the interests involved—with the social workers, who have to deal with the after-care that we have discussed, and with the staffs within the institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know whether any comparative studies have been made by the Government. Have any studies been made by Ministers or their advisers of the regimes in other countries, particularly in European countries? Scotland has the highest number of young people in detention, higher even than in England, yet experience from other countries shows that the more one moves away from detention and looks to alternative ways of dealing with offenders the more success one has. If we look to Holland and Denmark and other countries with different penal policies we can learn something. Again I ask what the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary have done in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Sweden?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1213</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention Sweden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to the philosophy behind this concept. The philosophy that comes through the public statements, the rhetoric at Conservative Party conferences, is the Ayatollah philosophy, the punishment philosophy. It is the short, sharp shock being seen as a punishment. Those are the very words, their fanaticism—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to understand from the hon. Gentleman's argument that he is in favour of the retention of the existing Borstal training scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If that was not explicit earlier, it was certainly implicit. Let me now say, explicitly, that I welcome the power of this clause, which deals with the ending of Borstal training and the ending of the indefinite sentence, Notwith standing that, I think that we need to look at the matter. We need to get away from the concept of punishment and towards the concept of treatment. I ask again—and this is the central point of my remarks—for someone on the Government side to try to convince us—as the Solicitor-General generously admitted I almost managed to convince him earlier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was when the hon. Gentleman was brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Solicitor-General to convince us how the detention—I cannot call it treatment—provision is to work, whether it is seen as punishment or whether there is an element of treatment, how that element of treatment is to work and what evidence there is to support the idea that detention will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I heard the speech just completed by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes)—not one of his briefest. In it he went on in his emotional style apout the lack of evidence to support such institutions as Glenochil. He said three times "there is no evidence that Glenochil is working."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene because some weeks ago I received a letter from a relieved mother enclosing a letter from her son, who was at that time at Glenochil. It was one of his regular weekly letters. It will be useful to the debate if what this young man had to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1214</span>
say to his mother is available to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to avoid confusion for those who read these debates, I take it that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) means the detention centre at Glenochil. Glenochil is both a young offenders' institution and a detention centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I am speaking of the detention centre. I ask the leave of the Committee to read this letter. Clearly, I have left out certain sentences which would identify the young man. I am sure that the Committee would agree that identification would not serve any public purpose. This letter was written as he came towards the end of his time at the detention centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall I get my hankie out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may make jokes about this now, but a few minutes ago he was saying "there is no evidence". It is typical of the hon. Gentleman and his ilk that when evidence is produced all they can do is mock it. I hope he will listen with a certain degree of seriousness to what the letter contains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The young man writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The time has realy flew … since I came of the report on Monday, and if it keeps going the way it is I will be home yesterday. I can't wait to get out and get a roll and cheese. I haven't had a roll for nearly 3 months so make sure you have plenty in when I get out with a bit cheese. This time last week I was near sick with worry but I am a lot happier since my time is flying in. I will just have to keep myself to myself and try to keep my room and kit up to standard to make sure I don't get put on report again. All I want to do now is get home and settle down into civilization again. I realize now that I didn't need to steal as I had everything I wanted at home. I suppose I just did it to be one of the gang. This place has done me a lot of good it has given me time to think about my future … Well, now that I have taken something out of it I will try my hardest to put something into it. I realize that it is better for me to do everything write than it is for me to do it wrong. I am going to put everything into these last few weeks and when I get out lead a normal, desent life … I dread to think what would happen if I had not come in here the way I was going I was realy bad but that will all change when I get out."</p></blockquote>
A little later in the letter, he finishes by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The parade has just finished and I was told my floor is a disgrace. At least I didn't get put on report and I will just have to work harder next week."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1215</span>
Some Opposition Members may say that this person was reformable and that he is the exception that proves the rule. I believe that it is precisely for such people, who can be reformed, that this sort of institution and detention centre is necessary. I believe that the evidence in the letter to the lad's mother is reason enough for supporting the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that intervention by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) quite astonishing. When a senior member of the Conservative Party has to resort for evidence to reading one letter only—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one more than the hon. Gentleman has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be one letter more than I have, but what we have, and what I am prepared to produce during my comments, are statistics on the number of people who, having been through that detention centre, are then recommitted either to Borstal or to young offenders institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One letter does not make evidence. Maybe that youngster will stay on the straight and narrow, but he has only just come out. Let us see. I hope that the hon. Member will come back to his Scottish colleagues, if that young man commits another crime and returns to an institution, and apologise for using that as evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with young offenders is very difficult. It is something to which we have to give more time and care than the Bill is prepared to admit. My hon. Friends have made many points about how we ought to deal with young offenders. I find it astonishing that the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who calls himself a Renaissance man—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not call myself that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that that was the expression used. For the hon. and learned Gentleman to call himself a Renaissance man and allow his name to be attached to this legislation I find astonishing. The whole point about Renaissance man was that he believed in the individual spirit of man, believed in individuality. Yet this sort regime in detention centres is designed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1216</span>
drive out all vestiges of individuality in a child during the period of its detention. That is the purpose behind this sort of detention centre, which I find incredible. It makes me think that the Solicitor-General for Scotland is much more the Piltdown man than the Renaissance man—a primitive man who is discovered to be a fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime is designed to be as hard and as nasty as possible. The Government proved that by introducing the amendment which made clear that it would refer only to male persons and not to females. If the regime was to be adaptable and could be used for different circumstances, different individuals, and different sexes, an amendment would not have been introduced to ensure that only males would be treated in such a way and go to detention. However, I would like to ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland what will happen to female offenders, because I do not think that the Bill is very clear in that regard. Perhaps he will come back on Report on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it will be a hard regime. It will be a return to the short, sharp shock. That has already been tried. Twenty years ago that system was introduced and it was agreed that that would be the way to do it. Nearly every institution set up in Scotland, except the Glenochil detention centre, had been dropped. The clause intends, rightly, to get rid of the borstal system. There is no disagreement on either side. Where the disagreement comes in, and why my hon. Friends and I will be voting against the clause, is on the question of what is replacing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many people entering borstals who now will be going into detention centres. One assumes that in 1978, 670 boy went to five borstal institutions in Scotland. I assume that in most such cases a similar number will now go into the detention centres instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a piece of pure, political ideology, or political populism, appealing to the law and order bandwagon in order to satisfy, as my hon. Friends have said, blue-rinsed, hatted ladies at the Tory Party conference. The Government are saying that young violent offenders need this sort of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Glenochil detention centre—and I refer specifically to the detention centre, not to any other centre—of the detainees who passed through in 1977–78, 23 per cent. were sentenced for minor offences
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1217</span>
such as breach of the peace, 58 per cent. for housebreaking or theft, and between 11 per cent. and 13 per cent. for assault, robbery with assault and, in a few cases, for sexual crimes. Obviously those who commit murder, culpable homicide or attempted murder are sent to other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The percentage of all young offenders sentenced to borstal, detention centres and young offenders' institutions in Scotland from time to time is about 10.8 per cent. Where are these young violent people? Ninety per cent, of the young people who go to Glenochil detention centre are not violent. They are there for committing non-violent offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, that destroys the scare-mongering image, but the regime that they then undergo is in many ways likely to make them violent if they were not violent before they went there. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) pointed out, the regime involves everything being done at the double, and they have to do extremely monotonous domestic work and rigorous physical exercise. As he pointed out, of the average daily population of 150 detainees in 1978, 109 were doing dull, routine cleaning chores. The letter which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South read out made it clear that the young man was being dealt with because his floor was dirty or his kit was not in order. It is a spit-and-polish regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donal Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The genuinely interesting thing about the letter was that the young man was obviously deeply impressed and doing his level best, almost breaking himself, trying to co-operate with the regime, and could still say at the end that he thought that he was lucky not to be on report for having a dirty floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, but nevertheless 109 young men do not need to work every day to keep clean what are essentially rather stark premises. Therefore there must be a large amount of repetition and doing unnecessary boring jobs simply for the sake of doing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that there is the harsh physical regime of running to a stop watch and doing everything at the double. I ask the Solicitor-General to confirm that in the Glenochil detention centre compulsory religious instruction has been introduced.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1218</span>
If that is so it is a serious breach of the civil rights of the individuals detained there. Why should those who are not religious have to receive religious instruction simply because they are in a detention centre?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This punishing regime will inculcate, into a youngster such as the hon. Member mentioned, resentment at having to go through it and a longstanding hatred of domestic chores. [	<i>Laughter</i>]. Hon. Members may think that that is funny—I myself do not have a great taste for domestic chores. I would have to say to the Solicitor-General that if he is looking at my appearance he is tending to insult my wife and perhaps myself, because she irons my shirts.

The fact is that most boys will dislike physical exercise after having done it. But there will be a few exceptions. I have seen one example of a boy who had been in borstal—not, I admit in a detention centre—who had become extremely fit and interested in gymnastics. He was a very able gymnast.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit the nailon the head. When I first met that boy, he had just come out. He was repentant and determined that he would never go back again. But eventually, he used his skill as a gymnast, as my hon. Friend says, to the better to climb up the pipe and to get away from the police across roof tops. He used his gymnastic skills in the pursuit of crime. He became an expert cat burglar as a result of his training in the institution. It reinforces the attitude of those detainees who are violent, tough and aggressive because it is a tough, violent and aggressive regime. But, for those who are weak and inadequate and who cannot readily survive that sort of regime, it reinforces that weakness and inadequacy which is in their personality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying that it is a harsh regime which is not good for the inmates or for the prison staff who have to carry it through. However, does it work? That must be the prime factor. Is there any evidence, apart from the one letter received by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, that it works? The Secretary of State for Scotland has been claiming a high success rate for the Glenochil detention centre, but the figures from the Scottish Home and Health Department's annual report to Parliament for the five years 1974 to 1978 tend to disprove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give those figures. In 1974, the annual intake into Glenochil was 963; in 1975, 1,043; in 1976, 837; in 1977, 879 and in 1978, 919.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are the Scottish Home and Health Department's figures. I gave the Solicitor-General the source right at the beginning. The figures show the numbers recommitted to either a borstal or a young offenders institution for the same years. It does not include those who have been convicted and fined for any reason. They are: in 1974, 1,010; in 1975, 919; in 1976, 867; in 1977, 1,077 and in 1978, 1,056.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Solicitor-General, I cannot give him that information.

Surely if the Government are to put forward this kind of regime—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a document called 	<i>Cast Iron.</i> [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Government Members may laugh if that is how they, and in particular the Ministers, feel. However, are they seriously saying that they came to the Committee today to debate detention centres with no idea of the figures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Ministers are disputing my figures they should make sure that they have their own figures available when they reply to the debate. There is much evidence to suggest that over a five-year sample the number of people recommitting crimes who were offenders in detention centres is very high and does not bear out the Secretary of State's contention that there is success in keeping people off the streets. My figures did not include those convicted of crime who received non-custodial sentences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some unwarranted derision has been cast on my hon. Friend's figures by Conservative Members. Would my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am quite happy to look at any statistics which tend to disprove my own. If they disprove my own I will willingly apologise to the Ministers. But they would have to prove them wrong quite forcibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures produced by the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1221</span>
Council for Civil Liberties are not that different. They equally show—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is to refer to the figures produced by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, is it not appropriate that he puts it on the record that it has stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The best basis we can find for comparison (and it is a very crude one)"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not denying that the statistics are very crude. However, my figures for reconviction show a higher figure each year than for those detained. Because that is over a five-year period, that tends to prove that some of the youngsters, who went to a detention centre at 16 years of age are being reconvicted more than once between the age of 16 and 21 and being sent to other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may be taking some comfort from the fact that when taking the figures over a 12-month period—taking those convicted in 1978 and looking at those who were reconvicted in 1979—one may get some evidence to suggest that the regime works. But that does not bear close examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that for two or three months that regime may have some effect. So it is two or three months before the person commits the crime. One then has the procedures of the criminal court. We have heard about the long delays in going through the criminal courts. Those procedures have to be gone through before the person returns to a detention centre or some other young offenders institution. Therefore, it may well be a year, and so the statistics over 12 months are nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general line of the clause—the abolition of the borstals and the move towards shorter sentences for youngsters who happen to be given some form of custodial sentence—is in the right direction. That is the way in which we should be moving. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire said, the evidence from other countries which have reduced sentences and tried to seek other ways forward suggests that if the crime rate does not come down, it certainly does not go up as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That move in the right direction has been ruined. The Opposition have been forced into opposition because of the Government's insistence upon this political populism of the short, sharp shock. The Government are desperate to appease their own
	<span class='label label-info column'>1222</span>
supporters on this issue. This is what they are up to. There is no evidence that it will solve any of the problems of young offenders in Scotland. I shall, therefore, oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will be relieved to know that, having listened to that series of lectures, I am speechless. I propose to remain, as far as possible, speechless, except to reply to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), who asked some very important questions which I wish to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lesson of what was said by most hon. Members leads one to ask oneself a question. The hon. Member for Glasgow Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said it was wrong that anybody should be instructed in religion. Surely it cannot be wrong to be instructed in religion, because that, according to the hon. Member, will put one against religion. If one is instructed in domestic chores, one has a longstanding hatred of domestic chores, so if one is instructed in religion presumably one develops a longstanding hatred of religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that, if people are subjected to any form of discipline, training, or authority they automatically react against it. The hon. Gentleman put it as follows. If one is violent, tough and aggressive, it makes one more violent, tough and aggressive; if one is weak and inadequate, it makes one more weak and inadequate. In other words, nothing can be done to a person which will not inevitably make matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth, the quintessence, of the Opposition's argument is that they are against punishment at all. It is fundamentally important to be realistic. If, as Opposition hon. Members say, a man is made more able to hit women over the head and to run away from the police by physical training, then the inevitable inference of that argument is that to chain him upside-down in an armchair would be more suitable, as he would come out flabby hating being upside-down, and so would sit the right way up. That is not facing the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The brutal human fact is that people, for one reason and another, are naughty. When they are naughty, something must be done about the fact that they have been naughty, in the interests of us all. As I understand it, even since the invention of Socialism, the concept of heaven, which is the reward for goodness, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1223</span>
hell, which is the punishment for un-repented badness, has not been replaced by superior alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth that there is no job more difficult for a human being than that of a judge having to impose sentence. Even in the most trivial case it is very difficult to do. I believe that the judges in Scotland of all ranks do their very best to make a sentence appropriate, according to the twin considerations of the interests of those who are ooffended against and prospectively offended against and the interests of those who offend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but in order for the judge to give an appropriate sentence, he needs to know the purpose of any particular kind of sentence. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman answer the question that he has been asked What is the purpose of the detention centre, and how does it achieve that purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish anyone to feel that I have fallen in love with the hon. Gentleman but a more appropriate intervention he could not have made. Under clause 37 of the Labour Bill, the judge did not know what the disposal would be when he had passed sentence. That is why it was so inappropriate. Under this Bill, he has a choice of sentences. He knows, if he passes a sentence to a detention centre, what the regime will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those Opposition hon. Members who have spoken about the horrors of the detention centre voted for a Bill which retained detention centres, but they did not know who would be sent there, or when. It was not suggested that the regime at Glenochil would be changed, altered or reduced. All that was known was that, whoever sent him to that regime, it would not be the judge. That seemed to me to be an entirely inappropriate concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certain, under this legislation, that the judge, in making that appallingly difficult disposal, will do so knowingly. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire has sat on the Bench and knows what a heartrending business all judges in almost every case—even in comparatively trivial cases—find it to make an appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1224</span>
sentence. Let us not pretend that they do it for fun or think that they like being unpleasant to people. It is a very difficult matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people are curable; some are not. Some people are wicked and intend to intend to continue to be wicked. I do not believe that it is right—with respect to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth—to say that there are youths in Scotland who will be running about committing crimes in the hope of getting the great badge of Glenochil on their shoulder. If that is their ambition, they can get it now, and they would have been able to get it under the Labour Bill, but I do not believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart said that people would be brutalised and turned against physical exercise and compulsory activity, and would acquire a hatred of domestic chores. But some of us underwent basic training. Some of us underwent parachute training. Some people undergo training for the police force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some for the Bar and some, indeed, even for the WRAC. As was shown by the letter that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) read out, training and discipline can do a great deal of good. I remember doing my basic training in the Army. I thought that it was such absolute hell that I could not go through with it. I thought that I would not be able to make it. But, by Jove, by the end I was proud of my clean bed space, my belt and my boots, and I can tell the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth something that he may not appreciate: I do not wish to have to do it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All forms of human discipline can create in a person a pride. The purpose of the detention centre regime is to say to a person: "Here is the moment to pull your self together. Here is the moment to realise where you are going if you do not. Make an assessment of yourself and get some pride in yourself and your family." What we are doing, therefore, is to give judges an opportunity in sentencing to say that, for those for whom that appears to be the helpful way forward, that shall be the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that "the bobbin", the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), is jumping up and down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1225</span>
For those not sentenced to a detention centre there are multiple establishments. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth asked whether those concerned would be assessed in regard to training and what educational, industrial commercial or technical training would be appropriate. The hon. Member told us about a youth digging drains and asked what the youth had achieved. He had achieved pride in himself. That is what is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our hope that by the variety of disposal that the clause gives more people will be saved from the futility of a life of delinquency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since the Committee finished with the rudiments in the question of the judges, but the hon. and learned Gentleman came back to it again and said that there was a choice for the judge. We accept what he says about the judge doing his best in regard to the length of the sentence and where the offender should go. The question is whether judges are the best people to decide the nature of the regime on the basis of the trial and perhaps one or two reports, or whether it should be those who now have the custody of, and the care and responsiblity for, the person and who have time to make sure that the treatment he gets and the institution he goes to is the best for him, to attempt the twin purpose of making him aware of his naughtiness—the rehabilitation of that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing that no choice is given in the clause—first, because the length of the sentence immediately prescribes the form of institution to which the person will be sent, and secondly because no indication is given that there will be a variety of institutions to which those who have care and custody for those offenders can send them. Detention centres are meant to give a short, sharp shock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not the Solicitor-General being unfair to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and his Bill, which referred to youth institutions, based on the 1969 paper, which envisaged a range of institutions? I liked the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, but I think that it is false.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Judges know the variety of regimes at present, and they will know them in future. I do not want to go through all the institu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1226</span>
tions in Scotland. If the hon. Gentleman wishes, I can send him a list of their variety. It is important that, after assessment, people should go to the right institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear. A short sentence at a detention centre is likely to be the alternative to a long sentence at a young offenders institution. I think that that is important. The cure of sin has never been an easy matter. Let us be clear that what we are doing in this Bill is giving the courts a variety of sentence that they would have had under clause 37 of the Labour Bill but under which they would not have known what they were using. If they had said "I sentence you to 18 months" they would not have known the disposal. Therefore, I do not think that it lies in the mouth of Opposition Members to criticise the Government when we are determined that the purpose of any sentence shall be to save the youth from his own delinquency and society from his assaults upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been an interesting debate. Some useful comments have been made on each side. I was glad that we heard the letter that had been received by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). Is he really clear that he had no intention of speaking? It is particularly fortunate that he happened to have the letter with him today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the letter had some value. It gave us a flavour and an insight into the regime at a detention centre—a flavour that was not given to us by the Solicitor-General. I took from the young man's letter that at the time when he was enduring the short, sharp shock he was truly repentant. What is not clear, on the basis of one letter, is whether that is a lsating impression which can be borne out by the results one or two years later. As I tried to say in an intervention, I was also impressed that the young man was clearly in some fear. He said "How lucky I am, despite the fact that I have practically broken my back to conform and to be a good boy, that I have not ended up on report because my floor was not shining as it should."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was an implication in the letter that if he had gone back on report, he would not have been released.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. Perhaps I am working on a false premise. I assumed that, under the clause, 16- to 21-year-olds would serve their sentences of between 28
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1227</span>
days and four months at a detention centre as we know it. That has not been denied, and therefore it is implicit in our debate. A regime such as is described in that letter will be the panacea. It will be the answer for all young offenders in that age group who are being put in a custodial setting for such a period. That is a hopelessly rigid way of attacking the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was attacked—almost derided—for un-shamedly producing statistics sent to us by a pressure group. It is interesting that nothing was produced by the Government. That is a sad state of affairs. The Government are putting forward a total change of direction in penal policy in the most sensitive area of the young offender, and they have done it without producing any evidence that there is a positive case for doing so. It may sometimes be necessary to take a leap in the dark—in other words, where one cannot run a pilot scheme of any kind. But we in Scotland have had the advantage of a pilot scheme running for many years—the Glenochil detention centre. I should have thought that it was essential to the intellectual respectability of the Government, before proposing such a far-reaching change, to carry out a proper examination of the statistics and and evidence, and come forward with a properly documented case. They have not done so. Therefore I shall have to try, in my blundering and amateur way, to fill the gap as best I can. There is not a great deal of evidence, but there is some, and it ought to be before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures are incomplete, but there is approximately a 20 per cent. recidivism among those who go to detention centres. That is an extremely hopeful figure, in my opinion. I am not impressed by figures produced by people whose very symbol is an attempt to get people to break out of prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for those comments. May I give him further food for thought? I am deeply suspicious of the statistics which he has pulled, I will not say out of his hat, but certainly out of the air, for which he has given no source and which is not backed up by any solid basis of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
There is an organisation, which I hope he will accept as respectable, called NACRO—the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. It is very largely funded by public money and presumably carried the imprimature of approval of the Scottish Home and Health Department and the Secretary of State. There is an equivalent body in Scotland called SACRO. I believe those are parallel bodies north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting paper produced by NACRO on recent developments in detention centres deals with Glenochil. It says that there is a shortage of statistical evidence. It is sad that the Government have not used their resources to obtain the statistical evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They quote an interesting letter, dated 24 December 1979, from the director of social work of the Strathclyde regional council, who I believe to be a responsible public official. It is addressed to the Baroness Faithful:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The truth is that there has been no work done in Scotland on reconviction rates from detention centres."</p></blockquote>
He goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My own impression, having supervised directly very many young men from detention centres on licence during the 1960s was that such centres have little impact on the criminal careers of such men."</p></blockquote>
That is a subjective impression, but it is from the now director of social work in the Strathclyde region. It is interesting that he says that although we have experience going back to the 1960s, and although there is this enormous change of policy, the Government have not bothered to collect the statistics which could have been made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NACRO report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only known, and publicly available reconviction figures for Glenochil are contained in a report of Strathclyde Regional Council ('Who Cares?' 1977) which reports that, on the analysis available then, 50 per cent. of those leaving Glenochil re-offended within one year."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State can shake his head, but he cannot go into a pet when he has produced nothing substantial on the other side. I hasten to say that "reoffended" is a loose term. It is broken down because they say that 30 per cent. of these were admitted to other penal establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1229</span>
The point is that within a year 50 per cent. had re-offended. I merely put this in as a corrective against the rather irresponsible optimism within which the change in policy is being lodged. It did not take any deep research—the research lasted about five minutes during the course of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an article on 27 March 1980 in 	<i>New Society,</i> which is a thoroughly respectable professional journal. On page 655, Mr. Jason Ditton gives an account of his researches at Glenochil. He has obviously visited Glenochil and spent some time there. He records that in 1978 there were 919 receptions. It is interesting—this point is also made by NACRO—that Glenochil is seldom full. The reason that it is seldom full, when so many penal institutions are crammed to overcrowding, is because sheriffs do not have sufficient cases which they consider suitable to fill it. The average daily population in 1978 was 157 and there are 180 single cells—or bedrooms. So it was under-used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Tories are right that this is the great panacea and answer to juvenile crime, it will come as surprising news to the sheriffs of Scotland who have been using less than the full capacity of Glenochil in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been suggested that it has been successful in dealing with youngsters. I do not know how one defines this, but 350 of the inmates in that year were found to have committed some 743 different internal offences in Glenochil. So if one is talking about a happy or constructive atmosphere, that must at least raise question marks. 919 were admitted to Glenochil in the full year of 1978, according to Mr. Ditton—and he admits that the statistics are not as complete as he would like. But from the statistics that he was able to find—and they must be taken seriously from such a responsible magazine as 	<i>New Society</i>—he found—and this is a point that the Solicitor-General must answer—that 3,050 graduates, if that is the right word, or former inmates of Glenochil were reconvicted in 1978. So there were 919 receptions and 3,050 were reconvicted. That has already been put on record and is worth again putting on record, coming as it does from 	<i>New Society.</i> That is well over three times the annual intake reconvicted within that year. If we are saying that that is evidence of confidence in Glenochil, it seems to me that we are living in the land of false promises, false optmism and,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
in regard to penal policy, bordering on deceit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be flimsy but it is all that I can produce, and it all points to disquiet—not the opposite. I repeat the charge. It is monstrous to make detention centres the one unique and only answer for that category of offenders on no basis of evidence from the Government, and from what little evidence we can glean outside I suggest that this is a dangerous thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland has constantly said that he wants to go forward in the right way, that this is the right way forward for the individual offender. But, of course, he is providing only one way forward for the individual offender, short of a drastic increase in sentence. If one is to avoid the detention centre, one either has to decide against a custodial sentence or else, perhaps, artificially lengthen what was in the mind of the judge, which cannot be a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not entirely share some of the reservations about detention centres, in the sense that I would not want it abolished as an option. There may be cases in which it is useful, and it should remain open to those who are placing young offenders. I make no secret that I would have preferred for it to be done in the way proposed in the last Bill by assessment centre and deploying from the assessment centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the point, which is important to stress in view of the false arguments used by the Solicitor-General for Scotland, that what we are arguing is not who should exercise choice—not about whether it should be the trial judge or an assessment team—but that choice should be exercised by someone, and we are trying to save the choice and leaving aside the argument about who should exercise it. Our basic objection is that the options are being closed down in favour of one single, sole option, where the statistical evidence is extremely scanty and, where it does exist, is hostile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the Solicitor-General for Scotland saying that his life achievement was a clean bed space. That is a modest achievement but I can only say to him that we need something a little more substantial in the way of an argument to support this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bad for all those reasons and I should like to add another reason that has been mentioned by some of my hon. Friends about which I feel strongly. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1231</span>
clear that there will be a redeployment of the prison population. It may not vary in size but a much larger number of people will go to detention centres. That may be bad for them but one thing I am totally clear about is that it will be bad for prison staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have struggled to improve the prison service, but I believe that our concept of the prison officer's role has always been far too narrow. He should not be seen just as a turnkey, not as a sort of Royal Marine physical education instrucor dealing with those who need to be knocked—I mean almost literally—into shape. There is more to being a prison officer. I fear that if we get more and more of the staff in institutions of the kind under discussion, we shall always be narrowing the horizons and the parameters of careers in the prison service. If that happens, the right kind of people will not be recruited, and as a result the wrong approach will be given to the problems of the young offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not just the immediate problem of the right disposal for today's offenders, but a matter of the whole development of the service which should be broadened, not narrowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sad business, because this fundamental reform has been brought in for the wrong reasons. It has not been brought in after careful preparation, after looking at all the evidence, and deciding after wide consultation what is best. It has been brought in as a response to a political need. I agree entirely with Mr. Jason Ditton's article, when he says
	<br><blockquote><p>"lobbing some extra red meat to its 'get tough' constituency."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the point. What has happened here is that the Government have said "We must have a strong law and order plank to satisfy our electoral</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>needs and our supporters. But we cannot, of course, have a great expansion in this area of expenditure. We cannot build up a wide variety and range of new institution because that would be extremely expensive. If getting tough means longer sentences, that means more expenditure, so we have to find a way of getting tough in acompressed space of time to save money." That is exactly what is at the heart of this proposal.</p>
	<p>The Government are looking to detention centres not because they know that they will do a job for the offender, which ought to be the primary consideration, but because they represent a method that will save money. At the same time, they will be able to say to their supporters "We've got tough with the young thugs and hooligans and we can all happily continue with the Solicitor-General in believing in original sin as the sole cause of crime."</p>
	<p>It is a totally mistaken premise on which to approach the problem. It is cheeseparing of the worst sort—cheeseparing combined with a cosmetic wish to appear to be bashing the offender merely because it is expedient to be seen to do so.</p>
	<p>I have a contempt—I can put it as strongly as that—for the basis on which the clause has been introduced. There has been no proper preparation, no ground work has been laid, and I think it is misconceived in principle. I fear that it will have a sad and misguided effect on individual people with whom it deals and on the development of the prison service. I shall have no hesitation in voting against the clause and I hope that my hon. Friends will press it to a Division.</p>

We move now to an entirely different matter, one on which our passions might not run so high and on which I fear that I may once more get the support of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker)—indeed, perhaps even the Minister. I hope that after I have explained it carefully to my colleagues, who may have jumped to conclusions, I shall receive the support of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that the maximum fines should be index-linked. It was hinted to me earlier that this was not in tune with the generally liberal tone that my hon. Friend and I had been taking in this debate—myself particularly—and particularly in the previous debate, in which, as I am sure my hon. Friends will agree, I pursued the case that they were pursuing with equal vigour, if not equal eloquence, to that of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on our side must think honestly what we are doing. We must not react in a Pavlovian way and oppose everything that seems to be against the criminal. I want to be against the criminal. I am not in favour of crime being committed. We must be clear that the first priority is the prevention of crime and that the next is the efficient detection of crime; that we are in favour of a fair judicial system, so that everyone is treated fairly, but, that once someone is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1234</span>
found guilty, we are in favour of appropriate action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That appropriate action, in certain cases, may be generous, kind, liberal treatment. In other cases, it may be a firm, clear effective fine. The maximum fine is provided so that the judge may have discretion. The judge can say "I shall fine you the maximum, if I think that your means are such that you should be so fined." He can also say "Taking account of the poor circumstances of your background and other circumstances, I shall not fine you anywhere near the maximum." The discreation is with the judge. The maximum is provided to show the judge that Parliament does not wish him to go above that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience has been that many sheriffs, judges and other people, particularly in the district court, will take account of circumstances and will not impose the maximum fine. But the maximum is there. It is there—and I commend this to my hon. Friends on the Back Benches—to penalise people who can afford it and whom it will hurt to have the money taken from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suggesting not a soft option and not a hard option. What I am suggesting is logical. The Act that is being amended was introduced five years ago in 1975, and the penalties there specified have to be changed, principally because of inflation—not because the Government wish to be harsher to offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend checked the change from £20 up to £50 and from £25 up to £200? There are differences there. Does he not consider that inflation-linking is already taking place? If he thinks that, there is much strength in his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not worked it out exactly, but I hazard a guess that to increase a fine from £20 to £50 over five years is taking account of inflation. I leave it to the Under-Secretary to confirm that. It certainly does not seem to me to make the fines harsher than they were when they were introduced in 1975. They will be harsher than they are now, because they have been eroded by inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this argument will influence my hon. Friends: with inflation at 22 per cent. at present and showing no prospect of abating, in five years' time the value and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
effect of these fines will be less than 40 per cent. what it is now. If, therefore, one believes that fines are an appropriate way of dealing with people who have offended, one must make them as effective five years from now as they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is for the Government to have to introduce new legislation, year after year, five years after five years or 10 years after 10 years. That is wasteful of Parliament's time and of other people's time and money. I am suggesting not that we should build in a magical inflation figure because we hope that at some time inflation might be controlled—although, as I said, there is no prospect of that taking place at present—but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend embarks on that point, because clearly he will have to make a strong case on the inflationary situation, can he enlighten me on his amendment? In line 5 on page 37, paragraph (	<i>b</i>) refers to "312(	<i>z</i>)". My reading of 312(	<i>z</i>) in the 1975 Act is that there is no figure of £25 mentioned. Only a figure of £10 is mentioned. In the amendment it says £25. In the clause it says £10. Perhaps it has been increased by the rapid inflation over the past year by the Government already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is mistaken. My amendment is amendment No. 287, which adds new subsection (3) at the end of the clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that there was an up-dating Act in 1977. Perhaps that will assist both my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that materially alters what I am suggesting, which is that instead of bringing in Acts of Parliament, whether in 1975, 1977, 1980 or 1981, it may be necessary—it may not—and would be wise to have a clause which allows the Secretary of State to increase the fines, taking into account the inflation that we regret we have having to face under the present Government, so that those fines are as effective in 1985 and 1990 as they are now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to intervene now because the point the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) was anxious to make is correct. The amenment put forward by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is quite unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Criminal Law Act 1977 there is a series of offences for which the Secretary of State can increase the penalties by order. Until now the particular offences specified in the clause have not been offences on which the Secretary of State can increase the penalty by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 7—on page 87—at paragraph 44 adds to those offences for which penalties may be increased by order—a long list which is identical to those given in clause 45. Therefore, from now on it will not be necessary in relation to any of these offences to have a new Act. If the penalties have to be increased for any reason, that can be done by order in much the same way as the hon. Gentleman's amendment suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why he has increased the figures in the Bill instead of simply putting down the offences and saying that they will now be subject to increase by the Secretary of State? Would that not have carried out what is desired, or is the Minister changing the emphasis? Subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>) substitutes £50 for £20. Subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>) substitutes £200 for £25. There is an increase in the number of days in subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>). I am trying to obtain an explanation of the rationale behind some of the increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are different reasons in each case. In some we are seeking to deal with the effect of inflation. In others it has been necessary to rationalise the length of time of imprisonment as an alternative to a fine. I am sorry. That does not come in this clause. Basically, it is to take account of changes in prices since the figures were first met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct. We could have simply left out clause 45 and done nothing until the Bill was passed and then used the new order-making power. That would have delayed the introduction of the new amounts by whatever period of weeks or months would have been required. There was no advantage in doing it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that, in future, it will be possible to change these figures without the need for any new legislation, doing so simply by order. Therefore the purpose of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
the hon. Gentleman's amendment is met by the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the order come before the House in the normal way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All orders have to come before the House either by the affirmative or the negative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not accuse my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) of making an illiberal proposal. His sensitivity on that point was illfounded, despite the fact that he detected the agitation which I and several of my hon. Friends showed when he rose to speak to his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose the amendment because it does not allow for a considered review. If the Secretary of State is to bring forward from time to time proposals which will be contained in an order, that will allow the House to make a considered judgment on them. Making a considered review is far better than simply to have an index-linked change in the fines. I do not know what the mechanism would be. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire has ambitions to be the chairman of a prices and fines board, but I do not think that that would be a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend did not say what the timescale of the changes would be, nor did he say whether he wished to update them monthly, six-monthly, or every year. I read chapter 60 of the Thomson committee report, which I presume my hon. Friend has now read, and at no point does it deal with updating of fines. On balance, I think that the procedures outlined are adequate, and I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment to a vote, because I would not join within him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one question which may be useful before my hon, Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) decides to seek to withdraw the amendment. In subsection (1)(	<i>e</i>) there is an astonishing increase between the £12 and the £200, and between the £3 and the £50. In other words, within five years since the 1975 Act there has been an increase by 16 or 17 times. That is related to expenses. Does that mean that the rate of inflation under the Government has gone up by that factor? The fine has nothing to do with the punishment, because it is related to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
expenses, although the potential fine has also been increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could make the point that the period dates from 1975 and 90 per cent. of it was under the Labour Government. If it were due to inflation it would not be our responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that this is a consolidation measure. Although the figures purport to suggest that the increase is from £12 to £200, there have been changes over the period since then. The clause represents a consolidation proposal and it is not a single jump.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the gap is the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. The clause refers to the 1975 Act. There have been changes since that Act, but for purposes of consolidation the clause has been drafted in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), may I say that I have a number of ambitions but that the one he mentioned is not one of them. I am pleased that the wisdom of what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and I suggested in the amendment has already been anticipated by the legislation of a previous Labour Government. I apologise for using the Committee's time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment. It is on a familiar theme of the debates during the last few days on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 46 of the Act applies, I understand, to fines imposed as a result of convictions under summary procedure the same machinery for collection, supervision and so on as is presently in existence for summary procedure. We are all familiar in the summary courts with the machinery whereby, where a fine is imposed, particularly on a young person between the ages of 16 and 21, the sheriff will often say that it shall be under the supervision of a social worker. The theory—this is one area where theory is different from practice—is that a social worker will be attached to the case and will give what help and assistance he can to the young person concerned in the management of his finances while he puts aside the money to meet the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a considerable imposition on social work time, or ought to be. The trouble is that social work time is so scarce—and there will always have to be priorities—that what tends to happen is that fine supervision goes to the very bottom of the queue. I have seen that again and again. It is a very real event for someone actually to be supervised during the period of payment, unless he happens to be in contact with the social work department for other reasons—perhaps he is on probation, a member of his family may be on probation or he may otherwise be on the books of the local social work department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment merely to seek the Government's views as to whether it is wise to impose this additional burden on social work departments. No doubt the Minister will have statistics or can give an idea of the number of fines on indictment. I know that he cannot guarantee or estimate what percentage of those are likely to result in supervision orders, but at least perhaps we may be given an idea of the total number that have been imposed. I have learnt some thoughts from the Minister, but we have had remarkably little help from the Solicitor-General about the Government's views of the impact on social work departments of the additionals burdens of the Bill, bearing in mind the general rigorous context of Government public expenditure stringency. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
we shall have a little more luck with the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Amendment No. 252, I must confess, has the same direction and intent as the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). It has the support as the Minister will be aware from representations made to him—Members of the social work profession who are rather concerned that, in dealing with fine supervision, they are treated as glorified debt collectors. Is it right, when social work departments are under a tremendous strain, as they are at the moment—I think that I would have even the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) in this matter—that they should be expected to be debt collectors as well? I certainly do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to be persuaded that, at some point in the afternoon, I should support my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). But does he not consider that there is a value in the social worker regularly being able to see his client in circumstances such as this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend made that point, because it allows me to answer it. It might not otherwise have done so in the course of my argument. I hope that he heard what his hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said earlier—that the relationship between a social worker and his client is important in developing a trust between the client and the social worker so that the client can accept advice and guidance from the social worker. That relationship may be completely shattered by the social worker having to collect money. The role of a debt collector is totally different from that of an adviser or guide which the social worker normally carries out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, as do social workers, that similar arguments also apply to compensation orders. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will deal with that. Social workers should not be asked to be debt collectors for fines or compensation orders, and that is becoming an increasingly onerous part of their duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden in asking the Minister to deal briefly with the question
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
of public expenditure cuts and their effect on the social work department and on the supervision of fines. If, as we ask, that responsibility is taken away from social workers, it will relieve them to carry out their other duties. If existing social workers can be released from fine supervision to spend more time, for example, with old people, whose numbers will increase rapidly over the next two decades, that might help the Minister in dealing with the burden on social work departments whose resources, as he knows, are insufficient and will probably continue to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful earlier in the day that the Government were so generous as to agree to reconsider the matter I raised on an amendment. I hope that the Government will take account of this matter on which there is strong representation from the social workers, from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden and from me, if not by agreeing to our two amendments, at least in some other possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with a simple and straightforward extension of provision for the application of a fine supervision order to cases on indictment, whereas at present it applies only to summary cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like simply to give the information for which I was asked about the number of cases that would be covered by a change of this kind. This proposal was recommended by the Scottish Council on Crime in its report some years ago. These are not the latest figures but those which were available to the Scottish Council on Crime, and are relevant as an indication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of fines on indictment was 408 in 1972, or less than half of 1 per cent. of the total. In other words, out of the total number of fines, 99.5 per cent. are under summary procedure and only 0.5 per cent. under solemn procedure. The increase is clearly negligible in terms of any imposition on social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall also respond to the point about the general principle involved. I am aware that some social workers feel that they can be used as fine enforcement officers, and that that should not be their function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, all that is dealt with under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 which allows for the appointment of a fine supervision order: The words are

	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of assisting and advising the offender in regard to payment of the fine."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the statutory purpose for which the social worker may be involved is not the enforcement of the fine, but for assistance and advice to the offender in relation to the payment of the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that there are cases where such assistance and advice are helpful. Particularly, I should have thought, in cases on indictment whereby definition is more likely to be a serious matter, the fine is likely to be higher, and the implications of the case more serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main concerns in Scotland at present is the payment of fines and the use of imprisonment as an alternative. The Government are considering an experiment with fine enforcement officers to make the collection of fines more successful. However, on the point that the hon. Gentleman draws to the attention of the Committee, I can assure him that the clause under consideration will make negligible difference to the position of social workers. For that reason, and because in principle there is no reason why there should be a distinction between solemn and summary jurisdiction, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I shall do so, but I am not quite sure that the figures are as negligible as the Under-Secretary implies. Indeed, it is 0.5 per cent. of the total, but I suspect that, of the number of summary fines imposed, the vast majority are for minor motoring offences and so on, where there could be no possible thought of fine supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that, with indictment cases, there will be quite a temptation to make a fine supervision order, because it is held to be a serious case. I therefore think that the percentage increase in the number of fine supervision orders on the social work books will be considerably greater than the Under-Secretary's figures would lead us to think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I take the point and I do not wish to force the matter to a Division. A little reluctantly, because there are problems, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of some importance which has just been referred to by the Under-Secretary. I ought frankly to say that I tabled a similar group of amendments to these to the Labour Government's Bill in 1979. They attempt to remove the power to imprison someone for the non-payment of a fine of under £50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is perfectly clear. The Under-Secretary has just referred to the anxiety that is felt about the number of people who end in prison, not because the judge who was sentencing them thought that their personal circumstances justified a prison sentence, but because they had put themselves in prison by their failure to pay a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a large problem. The last figures that I have seen—and I make some apology for this—are for 1977–78, but I do not think that they have varied greatly in bulk terms. At that stage, I believe that over 40 per cent, of persons admitted to Scottish prisons were not sentenced initially to imprisonment, but sentenced themselves through fecklessness, financial hardship or a combination of social circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when the cost of maintaining people in prison is ever spiralling, this is a very considerable impost on the public purse. More seriously, it can have an extremely bad effect on the families of those concerned when the head of the household or a member of the family is removed to prison. It is constant a to the police and a disastrous nuisance—I think that that is not too strong a word—to the prison service, whose members have a constant army of short-term inmates moving through the prison system, cluttering the building and making it almost impossible to carry out the long-term rehabilitation that at least ought to be in the forefront of prison work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also bad from the point of view of the Department of Health and Social Security. I have had many complaints from the Department's staff that the sudden impact of the removal of a member of a family—perhaps its head—to prison makes problems for the Department. Often, too, there is an undignified scramble to get together the benefit money in an attempt to spring the unfortunate from prison. It is often done on a club basis by a consortium, if I may use the phraseology of capitalism, which gets together to raise the wind to get Johnnie or Jimmie out,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
and this can be a considerable administrative hazard in the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that this is a considerable problem. I was obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) when he replied to my amendments in our debate on the previous Bill. He said—col. 489–90—that in 1977 144,282 people were fined a sum of £50 or less. Inflation will have dealt very largely with that figure. It will have dropped, because the number of people who are fined less than £50 will have decreased as the value of the pound decreases under present economic policies. However, it will still be of a substantial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend went on to say that of that 144,000 no fewer than 5,870 from that category ended up in prison for nonpayment. There were nearly 6,000 people going to prison—an impost on the public purse—not because they deserved prison or because they were thought suitable for prison, but because they could not, or would not, pay their fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often suggested to me that if we were to remove the penalty of imprisonment we should be making a mockery of the law. There is a good deal of anxiety about the present number of unpaid fines. I direct the Committee's attention to col. 483 of the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Committee stage of the Labour Government's Bill, where it is reported that about 30 per cent. of the total fines of 1977–78 were outstanding at the end of the year. That is a highly misleading figure, because proper provision for instalment payments means that there will always be a heavy backlog of properly unpaid fines at the end of any year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is perhaps a somewhat more helpful figure, although I fear that it may be open to misinterpretation, is that the amounts of fines written off in 1975–78 as a percentage of the total were 0.54 per cent., 0.70 per cent, and 0.61 per cent. So at the end of the day the number of fines that had to be abandoned as un-collectable was almost insignificant when measured against the large amount of £4 million—plus of fines levied in a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my first argument is that non-payment of fines is not anything like as serious a problem as some of the more excitable commentators in this area would have us believe. If we took away the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
alternative of imprisonment for small fines under £50, we should find that the percentage of fines unpaid would probably remain static. I do not believe that there would be any great increase. We should find that the vast majority would be such people as the members of the Committee who get done under section 3 of the 1972 Road Traffic Act and are fined £20 for it and will pay on the spot. It is extremely unlikely that such people would be affected by the retention or otherwise of prison as an alternative penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to get rid of the clutter—I resisted the temptation to say "sclutter," even though the Solicitor-General is not here—of prisoners in our gaols who have an average length of stay of about 14 days. What is the logic of putting a man in prison for 14 days, with all the disruption and difficulties to which I have referred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My basic plea is that there is a strong administrative case, and a strong case on penal policy and for saving the public purse. There is also a strong case in terms of humanity for abolishing imprisonment as an alternative to a fine at the lower end of the scale—fines under £50. The majority of people who fall into that category and end up in prison as a result are likely to be those who, perhaps through fault of their own, or no fault of their own—how can one apportion fault?—find themselves unable to pay the fine at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of balance. The balance of convenience for society is that we should say "We will try to get the money back in all sorts of ways," which I shall describe in a moment, "but we shall not cart them off to prison," thereby doing ourselves and them a disservice—and, I think, no great service to the administration of justice, the majesty of the law or any other concept that might be thought dear to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer—I have only sketched it in, because this series of amendments must be to provide a debate and not be seen as a final statutory form which any solution should take—is that we have to rely on civil diligence here. I start with a statement of considerable anxiety. It was disappointing to hear from the Minister a few minutes ago that he was still thinking of an experiment offline collection. If he looks at the 	<i>Owcial Report</i> of the proceedings of the previous Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill he will see that the Front Bench
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
spokesman of the then Labour Government said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should tell the Committee that the expeiment"</p></blockquote>
the experiment of fines enforcement officers in both Airdrie and Edinburgh:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has not yet started for a number of reasons, not least because of the industrial disputes, but we hope to have it started as soon as possible."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 February 1979; c.492.]</p></blockquote>
There was, quite properly I think, a slightly defensive note in the voice of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), because he was apologising for the fact that he had not yet managed to get the scheme off the ground. That was at the beginning of 1979. We are now halfway through 1980—almost 18 months later—and the Minister is still saying, somewhat optimistically, that he hopes soon to have an experiment on fine enforcement and collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it does nothing else, I hope that this debate will extract information from the hon. Gentleman as to why there is this hold-up, whether it is likely to continue and when the fines enforcement officers will be in post. I believe that they might do a great deal to obviate the necessity for sending people to prison if they were able to give advice and guidance. I do not see them as a kind of press gang trying to get the money. I believe that there is a lot to be done in terms of advice and guidance on managing a budget that may be extremely small. Therefore, my first suggestion is that we should look at the fine collection system and try to get that experiment beyond being just a gleam in the ministerial eye and actually in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think also that we shall have to rely on civil diligence. It may happen only in a small minority of cases, but, clearly, if someone refuses to pay a fine and is working, there is no reason why his wages should not be arrested—not perhaps to the cruel extent that at present civil diligence sometimes allows, but a variant on that system to allow a clawback from the wage packet to meet the outstanding fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is controversial, but I also would not be averse to direct deduction from benefit. This, I know, sounds like a harsh solution, because at the end of the day benefit, particularly supplementary benefit, is geared to an essential
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
minimum to keep body and soul together, and the State says "Your income must not drop below that." To allow it to drop even by £1 or 50p a week in order to meet a fine may sound harsh, but there are two answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first alternative is to cart the offender off to prison. One has to balance the realities of that situation, so a modest and sensible instalment deduction might be a much more humane and sensible way to deal with the problem. Secondly, as the courts in any event would have decided that the offender ought to be fined and would have set instalments, all we should be trying to do is to put into practice what the courts in their wisdom—I use that phrase in no sarcastic sense—had decided was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe that fine collection officers, wage arrestment and direct deduction from the DHSS might do a great deal to provide the right alternative in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said in the earlier Committee by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) that he did not like such solutions, because it was sometimes difficult to trace people, but the present system is a farce. If we are talking about respect for justice, any hon. Member who is aware of the situation will agree with me, because what happens now is that if one goes into any police station and opens a cupboard an absolute avalanche of warrants for unpaid fines will fall out and envelop one. The police have got to the stage where they often do not try to enforce payment of these warrants and only if they literally and metaphorically stumble across the person concerned do they pick him up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have a farcical situation. Apart from the 6,000 or so people in this fines category who have been carted to prison, there are many more who do not bother to pay the fine and get away with it entirely. There are many warrants gathering dust month after month, year after year, and people get away totally with their non-payment without check. This is dangerous. In the long term other things may be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility might be considered—I believe a report from the Expenditure Committee of the House dealt with it—of developing community service orders as an alternative sanction for the nonpayment of fines. That could all be done at leisure. The important thing is to get away from the present daft situation in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
which people are taken into custody without consideration of both the cost to us and the cost to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these remarks have outlined the case. I finish by quoting the Solicitor-General. I am sorry that he is not here, because on this occasion I shall be quoting him with entire approval. I moved the equivalent amendments to the 1979 Bill, and this is what the present Solicitor-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I begin by saying that it seems to me totally insane that people should go to prison for up to 14 days for non-payment of fines up to £50. I find it even more insane that those people, who, from the last figures which the Minister gave us, number almost 6,000, will after the passage of the Bill be able to go to prison only for less than a fortnight."</p></blockquote>
The point was that he thought that the position was insane. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It really seems to me a terrible indictment on a penal system if we have thousands of people in prison for a few days because they did not pay a fine, which to them was either more valuable than their liberty or else was beyond their reach or their care." [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 February 1979; c.492–1193.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with the Solicitor-General that it is a "terrible indictment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendments are probably not adequate, but my case is that we should accept the principle, not just in terms of paying lip service, but as a firm commitment to do something about it. I pushed the amendments to a vote last time, and I am pleased to say that I had the support of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and the present Solicitor-General. I do not say that in any attempt to embarass them. The present Solicitor-General broke ranks. It was a split Committee. In the "Ayes" Lobby we had 50 per cent. Labour and 50 per cent. Conservative. This is not a matter of party politics; it is a phenomenon which is all too scarce today, and it would be a remarkable novelty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that occasion the Solicitor-General and the present Government Whip voted with me and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael). We voted together, because, like the Solicitor-General, we thought that it was an insupportable situation that we should continue to get the worst of every world from the point of view of the offender, his family, the administration,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
the court system and the penal system. From every standpoint it is an attack on the present lunatic situation to adopt the terminology of the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as brave or as adventurous or as revolutionary a concept as it may look at first sight. It only deals with the minor fine under £50.I hope that members of the Committee will not shy away from this but will look at it seriously and consider giving their support to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend. I see that he managed to get one Labour member of the Committee last time and I am sure that he will have more on this occasion. The figures are indeed staggering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally staggering are the figures put forward by my hon. Friend in relation to his experience in Sweden. In 1979 he said in the Committee on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have to admit that in all their prisons they had only two people in prison in default of payment of fine, but, there again, in countries such as Sweden a tremendous amount of research is done on the person before he or she comes to court to find out how much that person can afford from daily income in relation to the possibility of being fined. In Sweden incidentally, it is day fines."</p></blockquote>
That underlines again the general thesis we have adopted on this side on the need of information, the need of care, the need of understanding to deal with the problem. It is also true that he gave us warning about the situation in Sweden. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the reasons why there are not more people in prison in Sweden in default of paying fines is that most people have their furniture sold in order to pay their fines."</p></blockquote>
However, I stress that I think all of us accept that it is a nonsensical situation. It is not an effective situation and does very little for law and order and nothing at all for the family or for the offender to find himself in this position. With this kind of level of finding we are not dealing with hardened criminals. They may be feckless, or one thing and another, but few of them are hardened criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote again the Solicitor-General for Scotland, but in no carping sense. We have often twitted him for his past speeches, although I have tried not to do so, but I do it now with understanding of his position and understanding his absence. He said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whichever way one looks at it, it cannot surely be believed that the period if imprisonment was in the least helpful to them or the community. Therefore, as a system, it seems to me to be quite inadequate and foolish to detain in custody for up to a fortnight for non-payment of fines of £50 people who, from the last figure, numbered about 6,000."</p></blockquote>
That kind of figure, unloaded into a prison system, of course, is an intolerable situation. I think that the Solicitor-General probably retains that view, despite the fact that he has to do his duty and get the Bill through. That is why I referred to his absence and I can understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State did not vote at all, so we have one-and-ahalf on our side and we may yet make out. But the Solicitor-General for Scotland said that he was in doubt as to what could be done. He could not see the alternative—how to deal with the situation. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless the hon. Member for Garscadden can come up with a more convincing sanction … I shall find it difficult to support his amendment".</p></blockquote>
And my hon. Friend did as he did today, including another suggestion. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a possibility of day imprisonment. People could be asked to report for specified periods of time. After all, if we take a man's labour as being at the moment based on average earnings, worth about £2 an hour, or just over £2 an hour, he would not have to put in an awful lot of hours at some sort of centre to knock off a £10 fine."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 February 1979;[cc.489–96.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think that he mentioned that suggestion but it is very worthwhile, and there are plenty of ways in which this kind of social work of one kind or another could be helpful, Goodness knows, the local authorities are under enough pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we get a sympathetic response from the Minister. I am too gloomy about the passage of the Bill to expect a positive response by his saying "Yes, we shall take action". But I hope that he will promise to look at it very carefully, follow up what has happened to the experiment that presumably was under way a year ago, and see how we can deal with this. We shall certainly expedite it. If he comes up with a solution before Report—although I do not think he can manage that—or if he wants to come forward with a small Bill on this, Opposition Members will do everything they can to facilitate the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made reference to the fact that I do not appear to have voted in the Division on the last Bill. I was serving simultaneously at the time on two Committees, but I cannot remember now whether my abstention was voluntary or involuntary. Nevertheless, I shall make the Government's position clear today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say this in defence of my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland, whose remarks in support of the proposition were being quoted, and quoted approvingly. It was, and remains, an extremely difficult problem. My hon. and learned Friend said:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am in a genuine dilemma because I find it so difficult to think of a sanction. I am utterly against imprisoning people in such large numbers for up to a fortnight for these small fines. But I see the difficulty of finding a sanction."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 February 1979; cc.493–4.]</p></blockquote>
The basic point at issue is the question of alternative sanction, because I believe that all hon. Members accept, first, that it is highly undesirable, where people have been fined and it was not thought necessary to sznd them to prison, that they should, nevertheless, end up in prison; but equally it is intolerable to have a penalty which, if it is not paid, is ignored without there being any consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in total sympathy with the objectives of hon. Members who have spoken—that it is essential to find a more effective way of dealing with the non-payment of fines in Scotland. We have too high a level of persons admitted to prisons for non-payment of fines. The level is not only higher than that in Sweden; it is higher than that elsewhere in the United Kingdom, although it is difficult to be sure of the precise reasons for that. Nevertheless, it is unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of interest to the Committee to know the extent to which persons whose fines are under £50 are sent to prison for non-payment. I believe that the hon. Member for Garscadden will be interested in these figures. We have figures for only one year because the special exercise was carried out in 1977. In that year the number of fined defaulters who were sent to prison was 7,426. Of those, 79 per cent. had been fined less than £50. Therefore, almost 80 per cent, of those sent to prison for non-payment of fines were originally fined less than £50. So the problem of those fined less than £50 is not a marginal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
one. It is central to the whole issue of imprisonment for non-payment of fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether there is an alternative sanction that could be reasonably put forward as a way of avoiding prison as an unfortunate necessity. Some hon. Gentlemen have referred to the question of community service orders. I hope that these will be used more widely. The Government have announced that community service orders will be available throughout Scotland and therefore, there will be no statutory or other reason why the courts cannot consider this as an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary of State saying that if someone is fined £30, for example, and he appears in a means court, he can have his payments varied—that is a common procedure—and that the alternative, instead of being so many days in prison, could be so many hours in community a service scheme? Is there some machinery that would allow that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it would qualify in that way. However, if the offence which had been committed was one for which imprisonment could be enforced, then if the court was contemplating imprisonment as one possibility, it would be entitled to suggest a community service order as an alternative. In such circumstances that could be provided for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because it is best to get this point clear. There is no possibility of a community service order being used in place of a fine if someone has defaulted in paying his fine. As I understand the CSO principle, there is no possibility of a CSO being used where someone has defaulted in paying a fine. My understanding—no doubt the Minister will confirm this—is that a CSO can be applied when someone has committed an offence for which the sentence could be imprisonment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. I think that we are dealing with a situation in which the offender who appeared before the court was well known to the court, had a previous record of non-payment of fines and perhaps a string of such offences. If the court knew in advance, because of the previous back-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
ground, that the offender was unlikely not to pay the fine, if one were imposed, and that imprisonment would ultimately be used, then if it were an offence for which imprisonment could technically be imposed from the beginning—which might be so if one were dealing with a repeated offender—the court could consider a community service order as one means of dealing with it.

I do not suggest that this would be available for other than a minority of these cases, but, nevertheless, it is an option which would be usable in some circumstances and certainly one that should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a provision in the Bill which will help to improve matters. At present, the maximum penalty for default in payment of a fine of £50 is 60 days' imprisonment. Under the provisions of the Bill, that is being reduced to a maximum of 14 days so as to bear some relation to the worth of £50 nowadays compared with its worth when that option was first introduced. Therefore the length of an alternative sentence of imprisonment is now significantly less. That, we hope, will also lead to an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a provision, by virtue of clause 50, that civil diligence can now be used even if imprisonment has originally been contemplated. In other words, whereas until now one has had to choose between civil diligence or imprisonment for non-payment of a fine, the court will now be able to use its complete discretion, at any stage in the proceedings, as to whether civil diligence might be an appropriate way of dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked me about the fine enforcement order system and why a year had elapsed without the fine enforcement experiments going ahead. The reason, I fear, is quite simple: we cannot go ahead without legislative provision. Because the previous Government's Bill fell, new provision was necessary. Clause 25 of this Bill gives the new definition of an officer of law which is wide enough to include a fine enforcement officer, because someone with legal authority is necessary for this purpose. Until now it has not been possible to appoint someone with the necessary statutory authority. Once the Bill has been enacted, that will be possible, and we hope that the experiment will begin in September 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
The hon. Gentleman's alternative to imprisonment for non-payment of fine was civil diligence. There are many attractions in that, and it is indeed open to the courts at present to use civil diligence. I hope that far greater use will be made of civil diligence to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a particular problem with certain categories of offender. With an offender who has little means—he is perhaps on unemployment benefit—the use of civil diligence may lead to the warrant sale problem and the poinding of his furniture and so on. That would clearly be an undesirable outcome from everyone's point of view. It would not even assist the public interest, because it might produce the absurd situation of the authorities removing his furniture to pay the fine and the Department of Health and Social Security replacing it so that he should not be without basic facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While, therefore, I think that a greater use of civil diligence is highly appropriate for those in employment who have an income—and, although the courts have been reluctant until now to use it, many offenders are now in employment and have significant income, which suggests that a far greater use could be made of that remedy—the most incorrigible problem is that of those offenders who are unemployed and receiving supplementary benefit. I should have thought that they would be the most unlikely persons to pay the fines in the first place. Civil diligence, if it meant more warrant sales, would surely not be an attractive solution to hon. Members on either side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I am anxious to find ways of ensuring that the offender is in employment and has an income and where, by arrangement of wages of in some other way, the fine can be paid off over a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts now have the power to use this method if they wish, though they have been reluctant to do so until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the sincerity of the Minister's wish to cut down the number of people who go to prison in those depressing circumstances. I recognise also that there are genuine difficulties about the alternative. I take the view that if one does not grasp the nettle one will never do anything about the problem. I would be prepared, if I were in the position to do so, to push this matter to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
conclusion, but I recognise that that will not happen today. I regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find no satisfaction in the Minister's experiment has not started. I find it unlikely that it depended on clause 25, because that explanation has never been offered before, and it struck me as an explanation pulled very much out of a hat. I presume that he was referring to paragraph (i):
	<br><blockquote><p>"any macer, messenger-at-arms, sheriff officer or other person having authority to execute a warrant of the court."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, I was not. The hon. Gentleman will see that paragraph (iv) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person (or class of persons) authorised in that regard for the time being by the Lord Advocate or by the Secretary of State",</p></blockquote>
and that is the provision that we shall use for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes as a surprise to me. I shall content myself with saying that in any event we are now in a position to brook no further delay, if this Bill reaches the statute book, which seems likely given the progress that it is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not listening to me when I indicated that we hoped to start the experiment in September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted and we all look forward to its immediate start and to regular reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the community service order may, of course, be a useful innovation as an alternative to imprisonment. We accept that. But it does not meet our point. We should very much like to see machinery, which does not exist at present, whereby a sheriff faced with someone who had not paid his fine could say " As an alternative to paying the fine, given your reluctance to do so and, perhaps, your genuine financial difficulties which I accept, I impose X hours under the community service scheme."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend means that as an alternative to a punishment for failing to pay the fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as an alternative to prison the sheriff could say "I shall give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
you a sentence of X hours on a CSO." That would mean a considerable breakthough. It would be a constructive interim attempt to cut down the numbers, and its success or failure would perhaps throw an interesting light on the practicality of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider whether we should not try to extend the machinery in that way to allow the community service order to play that kind of role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as for civil diligence, if the Minister is saying that civil diligence is even now available to the courts, I think that the courts do not realise it. They may remember the power in an examination for sheriffs, but it is, to some extent, a matter of familiarity and of reminding them that the option is in usage. Can the Minister do anything to encourage them to look at this power constructively?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not that the courts do not realise it; they do realise it, but they do not like using the power because it uses up the facilities of the court in the supervision of wage arrestments and other means of ensuring that people pay the amounts due from their income or wages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. The Minister has said one or two helpful things, tentatively. He has indicated ways in which we might make progress, and I have considerable faith in his good intentions. I only hope that he is prepared to supply the energy to make them materialise. It is in that spirit that I am considering whether to press the amendment to a Division. I did so during the previous Bill's proceedings, largely to make a point. I was successful then because I carried with me into the Lobby the present Solicitor-General and the present Government Whip. I do not want to embarrass him on this occasion—there is no point in doing that—and I do not imagine that I shall have luck with any of their colleagues who might normally be thought to be in a freer position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those circumstances, having made my point, having had, I think a genuinely sympathetic reply—in spirit—from the Under-Secretary and having underlined my concern and interest in this subject, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 261, in page 40, line 14, after "a" insert "maximum."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the drafting of clause 49. It makes clear that where an offender pays part of his fine and defaults in the remainder and no period of imprisonment in default has been specified, the offender is liable to a maximum period of imprisonment determined by reference to the table. This was the point raised by Sheriff-Clerk Weir of Dundee, who pointed out that the absence of the word "maximum" might suggest that the periods of imprisonment listed in that part of the clause were the actual periods that had to be imposed rather than maximum periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

If the Minister is saying, as I suspect he is, that clause 25 covers the possibility of appointing fine enforcement officers, he should look at it again on Report, perhaps with a view to making clause 25 more explicit in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider that. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a minor but substantial amendment. It is one on which I have great hopes that we may have the support of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
Clause 53 allows disqualification and endorsement in two sets of circumstances. One is when the accused person has been put on probation. I have no objection to that. But the other is when an absolute discharge is the decision of the court. That is extraordinary. The point of an absolute discharge is that, although there has been a finding of guilt, it is so minor and in such special circumstances that it does not even rank as a conviction. Nothing is recorded; the person would appear in future as a first offender, and the offence would not appear in a list of previous convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In circumstances in which the court felt that an absolute discharge was appropriate, I do not think that what most people would see as the heavy punishment of disqualification from driving or the lesser punishment of an endorsement would be proper. The Minister may argue that there are circumstances in which there is no moral turpitude and therefore an absolute discharge is appropriate. But there may be doubts, for example, about someone's competence to drive and whether there should be an endorsement or a disqualification. I should have thought that in those exceptional circumstances the re-ordering of a driving test might be a possibility, or the most nominal of admonitions should be given in order to carry the disqualification and endorsement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be a very unhappy marriage with an absolute discharge. I am supported in this view by paragraph 45.1 on page 32 of the memorandum from the Law Society of Scotland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Disqualification and/or endorsement appear to the Council to be incompatible with an absolute discharge."</p></blockquote>
That point has also been picked up independently by the Glasgow Bar Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that absolute discharge will be left in the very special category that it is meant to occupy, and that there will not be added to it the possibility of disqualification and endorsement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will listen he will realise that I am totally sympathetic to the concept. The clause is in answer to a criticism from the High Court that one cannot be so indulgent as to give an absolute discharge if one wishes to disqualify. The effect of the amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
would mean that if one considered disqualification appropriate, that offender could never have the benefit of an absolute discharge or any other disposal which was as lenient. Therefore, it seems that the effect would be that where the courts thought that disqualification was appropriate it would not say "Because I cannot give that with an absolute discharge I will give him an absolute discharge." The court would find the person guilty and give him a penalty, possibly an admonition—it is an absolute discharge or an admonition. Therefore, that person would get more penalty rather than less, which is not what the hon. Gentleman wants. I think that the amendment would work in the opposite direction from that which he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am under some pressure. The hon. and learned Gentleman may make angry gestures if he likes, but I ask him to look at the matter again. It is a serious point, and I could talk at great length on it, but I shall not, for reasons that we all know. I hope that I shall not be accused of being unhelpful, but I suggest that the hon. and learned Gentleman should look at the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been recommended from sensible quarters, and it seems that the Solicitor-General has got the wrong end of the stick. I do not think that absolute discharge should attract what will be seen as a penalty. The High Court can sometimes be wrong, and its criticism should not always be incritically accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look at the matter again, but I am sure that I shall come to the conclusion that it is infinitely more likely to attract a penalty which would not otherwise be there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalties were last fixed in 1962. Hon. Members may wish to note that section 70 offences, like all statutory offences, are without prejudice to the common law, so that in more serious cases of the kind dealt with in section 70 charges would, if necessary, be brought under the common law. The amendments would increase the penalties. I think that it is a justified increase.

This is to rectify an anomaly which was caused by the Criminal Law Act 1977, which raised the penalty for a first offence of assault on a constable to £500, while the penalty for a second or subsequent offence remained at £200.
