	<p>8.35 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was engaged in a dialogue with the Solicitor-General regarding certain niceties of clause 6. I accept that it has been much improved by the efforts of another place. It is a better clause than when it was originally introduced into the House of Commons. We will come to the safeguards and their adequacy in a little while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to express my doubts about the practicalities of judicial examination and my reasons for believing that it will add to the considerable chaos and inconvenience that exist in the courts. I hope that it will not be resented when I say that I probably have more experience of that than most members of the Committee. There are many people present who know much more of law than I and who have played in much more exclusive places, having an exclusive right of audience and an extremely effective trade union to protect it. [	<i>Laughter</i>]. Well, I am a realist about these things. Very few, however, have appeared as I have in the custody court of Glasgow Sheriff Court or in the summary courts in the morning when the full committals, the section 102 diets and the other bric-a-brac of a normal sheriff court day are in process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it the logic of the Solicitor-General's argument is that these people will normally appear for judicial examination on the first lawful day after an arrest. If that is fitted into the normal situation in Glasgow sheriff court, presumably this will be some kind of annex, aperitif or hors d'oeuvre before the normal custody court at 2 p.m. at Ingram Street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine how judicial examination can be fitted into this context. I do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
know how many hon. Members present have been in the cells at 1 p.m. on an ordinary weekday in Glasgow Sheriff Court attempting to see a client who has been held in custody since the previous day. It is a positively Hogarthian scene, and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) would not dispute that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cells are overcrowded, people are being bussed down, and my experience is that often when one talks to clients, if one is fortunate enough to get a few words with them, in many instances they will not be clear about what they have been charged with. They may be unclear as to whether they are on summary complaint or indictment. In many cases I only know for certain the details of a complaint when my client is actually standing in the dock and I am able to whip it out of his hand and glance quickly over it to check if it is roughly on the lines that we had anticipated. If it is not, one has to try to wheedle a few minutes' adjournment out of an impatient sheriff so that one can take proper instructions. That would, of course, be on summary complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we introduced judicial investigation into such a situation, taking the indictment cases as a separate section first, it would be impossible to give any kind of advice or guidance to clients who were to appear. It may be suggested that indictment cases will not be taken in the normal custody court; perhaps they will be heard earlier in the day—at 10 a.m., for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my experience in the courts has shown me that at that time, too, there is enormous pressure. To my knowledge, at 10 a.m. we normally have the full committals. They consist of a rather sad little queue, with attendant solicitors nervously hanging on, that shuffles along like some kind of bread queue in order for people to appear before the sheriff and say their little pieces of "no plea" and "no declaration" and to ask for bail. If judicial examination is to be slotted in there, that again will cause extremely difficult problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressure at 10 a.m. is also caused by the fact that at 10.45 we often move on to section 102 diets, high court pleading diets and any deferred sentences that the sheriff may have to deal with. The whole day is one big conveyor belt, working under enormous pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that I appeared at 10.45 in connection with some pleading diets—I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
was helping out not long ago—the fiscal appeared with a large plastic breadbasket full of the necessary papers. That may be described as tupperware justice. Then there was a dirty rush of solicitors desperately trying to attract the fiscal's attention so that they could extract some advice or have some kind of initial consultation about whether their man would get bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps judicial examination will be put on one side and a separate court will be organised—I do not know. However, the problems in actually doing that would be considerable, not to mention the expense. Not only the sheriff's time and the fiscal's time would be involved. We now know—I welcome this as an essential feature of the proposal, and wish to discuss it on later amendments—that a shorthand writer will be supplied. A record will be produced and served on the various parties. That is necessary, indeed essential. However, shorthand writers, being highly skilled people whose time is highly priced, inevitably produce high bills. Anyone who examined those costs, and also the subsequent costs of extending—in triplicate, I believe—the various results of the judicial examination, would see that considerable difficulty would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be an unconscionable burden to place upon the courts administration, whether on the fiscal, the fiscal's staff or the shrival bench. I am not convinced that at the end of the day we should get very much out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be impossible for the defence solicitor to give any proper advice to his client about what was likely to happen and what line he should take. I concede—we shall have to return to the theme when we look at the fundamental problem of the right to silence and the attack upon that right—that in most circumstances the proper advice to give to one's client may be that he should say nothing at judicial examination if he is in any doubt. Given the lack of preparation and the lack of information available in the real life of a Scottish sheriff court, the client is almost bound to be in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a rather similar matter was canvassed by the Colinsay Commission in 1871—no doubt the Solicitor-General will be familar with that commission—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman's sartorial elegance may be an attempt to create the impression that he was on a commission in 1871. However, I believe that even he has not yet achieved immortality, despite his best efforts. In any event, the hon. and learned Gentleman will remember that the Colinsay Commission foresaw that accused people at a judicial examination would start making no declarations and saying nothing at all as a result of the provision of legal advice. It feared that the better class of person would have legal advice and would learn to say nothing, and the ends of justice would then be defeated. Of course, it is not just the better class of person now who has legal advice. Legal aid is available and everyone will have the benefit of legal advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Solicitor-General as a serious risk that it may become the common practice to say nothing, and the whole thing will be brought to naught. His immediate predecessor in office canvassed this point in the debates in another place, if I remember rightly. I cannot give chapter and verse, but I am sure that it was canvassed there. Therefore, that possibility exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on the assumption that that kind of blanket advice does not come forward to the accused, I ask you in a general sense, Mr. Gourlay—I hasten to reassure you that it is a rhetorical question—how a defence solicitor can give proper advice to his client in these circumstances. He will not have any advance notice of the extrajudicial confessions that may be the subject of inquiry. They will presumably be handed to him. I should like the Solicitor-General specifically to confirm that they will be handed to him in good time before a judicial examination and that there will be a proper opportunity to discuss them with his client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if that is done, there is the whole troubled question of self-defence. My own experience is that very often it is extremely difficult to know whether there is a genuine special defence until the point at which the full precognitions of the case have been taken and examined. Among special defences, self-defence, for example, is a very specialist legal concept. The accused may genuinely not be aware that he has a good defence of self-defence at the stage when he will be judicially examined.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
It is often a matter of some debate whether certain circumstances amount to a special defence, and it is a debate that can be carried out properly only on the basis of full precognitions, full discussion and sometimes very anxious consultation with those learned in the law, our betters and superiors from the Faculty of Advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fallacy to assume that every accused, initially, when hurried on that first lawful day with only the most peremptory and perhaps perfunctory consultation with his solicitor, will be in a position to know whether he has a special defence. If he has, he must stick it then at his peril or else hold his peace for ever and, if he does not, pay the price of adverse comment from advocate-depute, fiscal, sheriff or high court judge. It is wrong to assume that that can adequately be done in the cramped circumstances that will almost certainly arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are often circumstances in which inevitably a man appearing on a serious offence on indictment on the first lawful day will not be in a position to give full instructions or to reveal all to his solicitor, maybe for all sorts of reasons which are understandable but which may be expensive. I see the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) looking at me with a somewhat quizzical air. How often, for example, has he come across a case in which someone has been in bed with a lady who was not his wife?—The hon. Member for South Angus may have had a sheltered life and not have come across that concept. But I assure him—my knowledge is purely professional and academic of course—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what they all say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of that confirmation from the Under-Secretary that this situation is not uncommon, because it is very relevant to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not criminal. May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he should try it? He might exercise some of his energy elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I am consoled by the fact that the Solicitor-General has such a high opinion of my moral character that he assumed that that would be a new experience for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
Returning to the straight and narrow path of academic discussion, for which the Committee is noted—I point out that it is common for someone to say "I didn't like to say that at the time because I did not want to bring my girl friend into it" or "I didn't want to embarrass my family."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some classic cases. I have been reading some of the interesting literary byproducts which have come from the criminal courts recently—one of which is decorated with a foreward by the Solicitor-General. In at least one famous case where this happened the man was hanged—according to the defence agent who wrote the book—because of his anxiety not to embarrass his family by admitting a sexual peccadillo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a large number of circumstances, of which that is only one, where, for human reasons—perhaps because of inhibitions built into our social peer group—people are not prepared to reveal all to their solicitors at an initial hurried interview when they are not aware of all the possible repercussions. They then find themselves caught in the appalling Catch 22 situation of clause 6, where, at the end of the day, when they want to advance the facts as a proper and necessary part of their defence, they have to overcome the damaging hurdle of attack because they are told that they ought to have blurted it out, inevitably without proper advice, at the judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point in passing that it is an imposition on the courts' administration and on the public purse. There are considerable practical difficulties for any unfortunate solicitor who has to advise in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 70 and 75 refer to the earlier point that I made about the time limit. I still press on the Solicitor-General for Scotland the need for a time limit—a maximum period which can elapse between the arrest and appearance in court of the accused party and any judicial examination which may take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75—if I may bracket it with amendment No. 70—is to insert at the end:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No accused shall be examined more than once under this section in connection with any alleged extra-judicial confession or the matter averred in any charge".</p></blockquote>
They hang together, and it goes back to what I colloquially described as the two bites of the cherry argument. No doubt the Solicitor-General for Scotland will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
want to address himself to that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves me with amendments Nos. 71 and 72, which if I remember rightly—and I am culling through the list—deal with important safeguards. Amendment No. 71 is to add a provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the accused is brought before the sheriff for further examination and the accused's solicitor is not present the sheriff shall delay the examination for a period of 24 hours to allow his attendance".</p></blockquote>
Even reading that I can see one fault in the drafting, but the sense is clearly to turn what at the moment is a permissive power of the sheriff in clause 6, as drafted, into a mandatory one. I accept that it is an unlikely circumstance given the fairly good cover for first appearances of the legal aid scheme, but in the unlikely event, particularly at a further examination—which the Government at the moment insist on contemplating, it would ensure that there was no possibility of a judicial examination until a solicitor had appeared on behalf of the accused, and with it, I would hope, proper opportunity for the solicitor to advise the accused about the implications of what was happening and how the matter should be handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 is a similar safeguard, because it seeks that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff shall have power to adjourn any examination on the motion of the accused's solicitor for a period not exceeding 24 hours to allow the solicitor to examine any alleged extrajudicial confession or other statement made by the accused or to advise him as to any category of defence that might be relevant".</p></blockquote>
I think that I am being reasonable, as I hope the Solicitor-General will accept. I am not suggesting that there should be an automatic adjournment at the request of the accused. That would be unreasonable. But where there may be a particularly extensive extrajudicial confession—one which, perhaps, is complicated and where the implications of what is said are clearly important—there should be a specific power open to the court to adjourn for 24 hours to allow further consultation to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to amendment No. 133 where we suggest 48 hours instead of 24 hours. It makes no difference to the sense of his amendment. It gives two days instead of one day. I should like to hear his views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) because there are so many overlapping and interlocking amendments. The distinction is that he is amending new subsection (3)B which is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the accused is brought before the sheriff … it shall be in the power of the sheriff to delay that examination for a period not exceeding 24 hours in order to allow time for the attendance of the accused's solicitor".</p></blockquote>
If I may say so, that is another version of my amendment No. 71. We are now discussing amendment No. 72, dealing with where a solicitor has been present at the examination but has, for good reasons, advanced the argument that there should be an adjournemnt of 24 hours to allow him to consult his client and examine the papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly think that there is merit in my hon. Friend's suggestion. I hope that the Government will have the problem of only picking between those two versions, namely, between amendments Nos. 71 and 133, and that they will then go on to look sympathetically at the rather different amendment No. 72. I hope that that is clear to the Committee and that we all follow those intricacies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are further groups of amendments that have to be discussed and I do not want to monopolise discussion on this particular group when we will, no doubt, all want to discuss the later groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the gravest reservations about the whole concept of judicial examination. I can understand the ease in its favour. But it seems to me that there are very considerable dangers, and dangers that have been widely recognised by a number of authorities that I think that the Solicitor-General would respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been something of a numbers game going on in the Committee, and I suppose that neither side will apologise for that. We have been perming the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates, the Glasgow Bar Association and the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. It has been "Take any two from six", and on almost any one of these clauses one side or the other can say "But please, sir, they are my goodies. My respectable men of professional integrity support us, and, shucks, we prefer them to your lot". But this is one clause, if I may say so, on which I think that there is total unanimity of opposition. I think that that is quite remarkable.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
The fact that the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is opposed to the clause is, perhaps, not entirely surprising, given its general approach to issues of this kind. I have no doubt that the Solicitor-General would be able to discount that and still sleep happily at night. But when we get a situation in which the Glasgow Bar Association, for example—and this is something of an ascending—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving up the scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is right. We are moving up the scale, but only in the narrow sense—not in terms of real worth or relevance—of the social scale which I used for convenience because I thought that it might appeal to some hon. Gentlemen, but I look at no one in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Glasgow Bar Association certainly are opposed to it, and they are the people who have to work the judicial examination system. They are the people who earn their living in the sheriff courts. They will have to scramble for the indictments, and try to make sense of what I believe will be a pig's breakfast when the Bill comes into operation. It seems to me that we are entitled to listen to what they have to say. The Glasgow Bar Association says that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"bitterly opposed to the provision contained in this clause. As presently framed this clause dispenses wholesale with the basic principle of Scots Law that an accused person need not prove his innocence.</p></blockquote>
I agree that, on occasions, things are said in heat, but that is a considered view and, as far as I know, "bitterly" is not a word that has appeared often in the Glasgow Bar Association's memorandum on the Bill. We are entitled to remind the Committee that this substantial body of practising solicitors in the criminal courts are bitterly opposed to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Faculty of Advocates is also opposed to the Bill. It is clear that it was a majority decision because there are six gentlemen with a point of view and a vested interest to defend who are members of the Faculty of Advocates and who are members of the Thomson committee. But they were outvoted by their colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
The Law Society of Scotland is not something where we can take some minor consolation from the Conservative point of view of seeing the Criminal Procedure Committee, unaimous or not, overruled by the General Council. This is a case where the General Council has come down firmly and strongly against the introduction of the power of judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not something where I am trying to make a majority verdict sound like unanimity. As far as I know, all the major bodies which have been briefing the Committee, or have been trying to influence the Committee, or merely making their expertise and information available to the Committee, are unanimously saying that they do not want judicial examination. It is time that the Government thought again about that and thought very hard whether they wish, in the face of that unanimity, to proceed with what I believe is a mistaken object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the practical difficulties, the reason why all these organisations are opposed to this doubtful innovation in the law of Scotland, this move out towards the inquisitorial system, is that is seen as an attack on the right to silence. Some people have gone as far as to say that it is an attack on the presumption of innocence. I think that that is a slightly less sustainable argument, although I think that one can follow the course of logic and end with that conclusion. But my main point is the attack on the right to silence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see—I am sure that the Solicitor-General knows the argument that I intend to deploy—how one can say that the right to silence is not attacked when the decision to exercise it is open to adverse comment. I hasten to concede, and accept immediately, that in another place that damage has to some extent been mitigated. If the accused party is prepared to sit through his trial not giving evidence, not advancing any substantive defence, his silence becomes not a matter for comment and not a matter for issue in the courts. But, as I understand it, as soon as that accused party puts forward a substantive defence, he is immediately open to the attack that he exercised the right of silence at an earlier stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised by the high proportion of members of this Committee who have had the job of pleading before juries and trying to peruade juries. I do not think that any Committee members would underestimate the considerable and devas-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
tating impact that that attack would have on the credibility of a defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that one can try to undo the damage. One can try to produce explanations but it is extremely hard to undo the damage, because the damage is done after one has completed one's case—it may be done in the judge's summing-up. Juries listen to judge's summings-up with extreme care and his lordship may take it into his head to say "You have heard the alibi witnesses. You have heard the accused's grandmother. It is up to you, ladies and gentlemen, to decide what weight you put upon her credibility. Her credibility is entirely a matter for you. But may I remind you that the accused, immediately after his arrest, had an opportunity to say where he was and did not say it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day that is clearly a damaging attack. As I said at the beginning, there are many circumstances in which it is impossible to produce a special defence or some other circumstance at the time of the arrest, although the defence becomes self-evidently good as inquiry and investigation proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain fundamental factors in a criminal system, such as the presumption of innocence, and the right to silence, should not be sacrificed lightly. We should fight hard to preserve them. I believe strongly that by moving down this road and listening to the siren suggestions and the lovely phrase "the innocent will have nothing to fear" the Committee will be totally misjudging reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may sound like a pettifogging point, but I make it because this is a situation in which I have often been. If a petition is the only paper one has in one's hand, either as the defence solicitor or as the accused party, at the time of judicial examination, it may not even give the time at which the offence was committed. It is very easy to say, if it is a case of safe-blowing in Glasgow, and the accused knows that he was with his grannie in Aberdeen on the day in question, he can say so at the time. If one takes that type of extreme case, there is a valid and plausible argument for the Government's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A less dramatic but more common situation is that the safe was blown in Glasgow between such and such a day, and such and such a day, perhaps with three days—weekend—in between. When
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
the time given is no more specific than that, it is extremely difficult for the accused; if he is innocent—it is the innocent party that we must worry about as well here—to know whether he has an alibi because he does not know exactly what time his alibi is expected to cover. In those circumstances it is ludicrous to say that because he cannot produce a cut and dried alibi he may at the end of the day be prejudiced at his trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was looking the other day at some papers at a case in which I did not myself appear but in which a colleague did. He was running around, extremely worried, because he had discovered that he had an alibi which he thought looked good in the terms of the complaint, but at the last minute, when full precognitions came in, it became clear that there had confusion about the time of the offence, and the alibi ended before the time at which the offence had been committed. The Solicitor-General for Scotland must, be familiar with this kind of practical difficulty as he must have been involved in such cases, which occur again and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that this clause is a dangerous innovation. It will lead to confusion and it is an attack on a fundamental right in our criminal system. I cannot see argument for breaching what seems to me a fundamental and prime rule. If I want to sit tight, and say nothing, at the end of the day I have the right to do so and should not be penalised for doing so. Otherwise it might as well be argued that people ought to make a reply to caution and charge, and offer an explanation at that stage. As I said earlier, they would be open to adverse comment if they did not. Or we might argue that people ought to give a statement to the police, whether they wanted to or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we have breached, in clause 6, the right to silence, the safeguards—which in fairness the Government have left, perhaps rather grudgingly, behind them in, for example, clause 2—might go on some subsequent occasion. This is a matter of principle—apart from all the practical difficulties which I have tried to describe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I hope that the Government will look sympathetically at amendments Nos. 70, 71, 72 and 75, which would do something to mitigate the likely damage, that I should prefer the Government to agree to drop this unwanted proposal, which no one loves, and which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well have been in the Thomson report; I accept that. But the Thomson report was in 1975 and it has now been examined in the cold light of contemporary day, by all the major legal bodies. Every one of them has come down against it, as has this side of the Committee. If they did not have a vested interest and a commendable wish to support the Government loyally, a number of hon. Members opposite might also have a more sceptical view of this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not lose hope that we may yet persuade them to take a cool and realistic look at what would be a considerably retrograde step for the law and criminal procedure of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) sought to suggest to the Committee that he was in a unique position to comment on this part of the Bill from his experience as a solicitor. Perhaps I can disabuse the hon. Gentleman of that and remind him that we have a number of things in common. Not only did he and I attend the same school—that well known, exclusive, fee-paying school in the west end of Glasgow—but thereafter we moved to qualify as solicitors in Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with some surprise, Mr. Gourlay, that one of my teachers from that selfsame establishment has just left the Labour Benches. However, as a lawyer I am always anxious to be strictly relevant and, therefore, I shall confine my remarks purely to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I have considerable sympathy with some of the points advanced by the hon. Member for Garscadden. After joining the ranks of the Scottish Bar, one of my tasks was to act in a temporary capacity as a procurator fiscal in Glasgow sheriff court for several days at a time and I can well understand and appreciate the sense of hassle that affects not only the defence side but, equally, the prosecution at the start of the court's business of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe it is important for the Government to appreciate just what the extra workload might mean if the clause were interpreted in any excessive way by an over-keen young fiscal. I give an example of the sort of confusion that can arise. I well recall from my days as a solicitor on the defence side being sent at

short notice to the sheriff court to put a plea in mitigation on behalf of a coalman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.11 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>9.26 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was telling you, Mr. Gourlay, about a coalman I once had to represent at Edinburgh sheriff court. The story illustrated what problems can arise from the hassle in a sheriff court on a busy day. At late notice I had received instructions to put forward a plea in mitigation on behalf of a coalman who was charged with selling underweight bags to housewives. I left my office in a great hurry, arrived breathless in the sheriff court and took my place to make my plea in mitigation. I did my best to put forward a powerful plea, explaining how the coalman had been unfortunate in his choice of staff, how he could not properly control the boys who were in charge of the bags and how it was all a terrible misfortune.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my surprise, I seemed to be losing the attention of the presiding sheriff, who appeared to be more intent upon the appearance of my client than on the terms of my plea. I was eventually interrupted by the sheriff, who said "Mr. Pollock, turning to your client the coalman, would you tell me whether he has a strong interest in amateur theatricals?" At this point I thought it prudent to look round to see what the sheriff could have in mind. To my horror, I saw in the dock a man wearing the full-dress uniform of a Royal Navy officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two men with the same name had been due to appear in court that day. One, the Royal Navy officer, was on a breathalyser charge. The other was the coalman. As luck would have it, the bodies got confused and I was making the plea for the wrong man. I therefore understand, from deep personal experience, the hassles that can cause such upsets in the courts of our land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden made a very vigorous plea for there to be no increase in sheriff court business. That is—in passing—a very powerful argument for the retention of all consistorial matters relating to divorce in the Court of Session. However, moving away from that slightly more general observation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
I foresee some difficulty over obtaining proper instructions from a client who really understands what is going on and what is the nature of the proceedings. All those who have been involved in the preparation of a case for trial have experience of a client intending to say one thing but who ends up saying something which potentially, in legal terms, could be highly damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind the case of the poor, desperate kept woman who has been treated to a life of bullying by her drunken husband. At the end of her tether after a drinking spree, she picks up the kitchen knife and stabs him. She then finds herself on a very serious charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible—it has happened in my experience—to go to the cells and be faced with a woman who says "I want to get shot of the whole thing. I admit that I murdered him".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immediately, one is faced with a legal dilemma. One has to tell the client that she is confessing to murder when one is clear that at most she should be pleading to a charge of culpable homicide, assult under provocation, or whatever. But because the ordinary punter does not understand our legal niceties, any killing, whether lawful, unlawful, justified or not, is classified in his jargon as murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the problem of the client's loose vocabulary, which is very different from the precise tight language of the court room. It is important to bear in mind that real difficulty can face those involved in the preparation of a case for trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore sound a word of caution to the Government. It would be wrong to present this measure as some kind of universal process to be applied in solemn procedure. I know that the clause does not provide that it must be applied in every case, but I hope that when the Minister replies he will make it clear that it will be only in the exercise of what I hope will be a very wise discretion that the prosecution will invoke the full judicial examination procedure. Otherwise, we shall cast a huge additional burden on the sheriff court, in many cases unnecessarily. We shall also risk a high degree of confusion which we must all seek to avoid for the sake of the protection of the innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must equally recognise that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
Thomson committee unanimously saw an important place for this procedure, when necessary. I do not run away from the need for it on certain occasions. I am fully persuaded of its efficacy in certain cases where, as the hon. Member for Garscadden well knows, a man facing a charge is far more likely to concoct a case after he has heard the prosecution's evidence. To anticipate that kind of nonsense and waste of judicial time and public money, we need this long-stop protection, provided it never becomes a universal system in the prosecution process. If we can get that kind of undertaking from the Government, I am happy to give the clause my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather surprised to hear the closing words of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). I thought that he had made a good case by mentioning his own expertise, the poor old coalman and the naval officer, and the kind of situation facing the client when an advocate comes in, picks up a brief and merrily starts on the case. The amount of time that we have taken to look at some of these problems is sometimes more than highly paid advocates take when they are dealing with clients, or indeed are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have done the right thing by giving the Solicitor-General the opportunity to introduce his reasons for the clause. I do not know whether he has studied the case, but he has been given that opportunity. But I was encouraged to come back with a few comments by the compliment paid to me by the Under-Secretary in our short break, when he congratulated me—I quote his words—for my "unbiased reporting of the Committee proceedings in the 	<i>New Statesman.</i>" I am glad to have that endorsement. It is also pleasant to know that somebody reads what I write. I shall certainly remember the phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should quote it in his next article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may do that. It might also be a reason for having a tape recording instead of verbatim reports, because the tone might have altered the sense of that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

by announcing in public that the Minister reads the 	<i>New Statesman.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that. I understand that previously the person who might have taken responsibility for such a decision and who used to visit Scottish Committees late at night to encourage the lieges was repressed by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), who came in to give the same encouragement to the motley crew of advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties that we face is not simply that we are making a change from an existing method of procedure—from an accusatorial system to an inquisitorial system—but that we are doing it at half-cock. The Government have neither gone the whole way to look at the complete consequences of the injection into an accusatorial system of an inquisitorial period and process, nor have they dropped the idea because it creates an anomaly. Therefore, they are sticking this clause into the middle of the accusatorial system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems here. The French system, which is fully inquisitorial, although the French are beginning to act to alter some of it, at least makes sense. It is a certain kind of investigation which has a certain impartiality. But we have written in an introduction which seems to be fatal in two ways, and I am now convinced that I was right to put down these amendments. The first is that this is basically 	<i>the juge d'instruction:</i> it will only be the prosecutor. It will be a direct prosecution questioning. I do not think that we know yet whether the sheriff himself will be entitled to intervene in the questioning and to take part in it. Am I right in saying that the sheriff will not be empowered to participate in that questioning but only the prosecutor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could answer the hon. Gentleman on that specific question, but it is probably better if I wait until all the points have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman is happy that I should proceed in ignorance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it will shorten the matter, let me say this. The sheriff can control the questioning, but he is not part of the questioning. The hon. Gentleman may know that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
another place, whereas previously the prosecutor would ask the open questions and the defence, for clarification, had to put them through the sheriff, the system has been amended so that the prosecutor and the defence are entitled to ask questions, subject to the approval of the sheriff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and, in the case of the defence, subject to certain other things. As I understand it, he cannot in any sense lead his client. The questioning will be related to questions put by the prosecutor, and the client's solicitor—it is not at the complete discretion of the sheriff—will be able to introduce questioning only in so far as it clarifies answers that have been given, such as the answer given by the woman who said "Yes, Sir, I am guilty of murder." As I understand it, the defence solicitor could then say "Let us clarify that," in order to put a question or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am right in saying this. The judicial examination is faulted in two ways. That is one of the problems of injecting one system of procedure—dare I say an alien system?—into the middle of the existing system. It has two faults First, it is not done by an impartial investigator, which is what the 	<i>juge d’instruction</i> is or should be in the French situation, but by the prosecutor himself. Secondly, it is not done under judge's rules. For example, one obvious element missing is that the witnesses are not under oath. Thus, the questioning at this stage has the power and effect of questioning which will be brought into full judicial procedure, but without some of the existing safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is exactly in line with what was wrong with clause 2, dealing with detention. In that aspect alone, it seems that a fundamental error is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it was based, as so many things have been, on the unanimous recommendation of the Thomson report. However, I recall that the Thomson report also in relation to this matter stressed the importance of tapes. I understand that tapes were also recommended for this process. We are now informed that we shall have the recording transcription from the procurator-fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So on those two matters alone this procedure has to be thought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to go on to the specific objections that have been made not by one or two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
but by every conceivable legal body. The Law Society says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council disapproved these proposals in 1976"—</p></blockquote>
that was after the publication of the Thompson report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and disapproves them again now ".</p></blockquote>
It says that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"imposes a very fundamental change in pre-trial procedure. The right proposed is the right only of the Crown".</p></blockquote>
There is no sense of bringing in an impartial form of judicial examination to establish the truth. It is a process to extend the power of the Crown because, as the document says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"it destroys, or materially erodes, the accused's right of silence and the presumption of innocence".</p></blockquote>
That is strong language from the Law Society, based not on the publication of the clause in the Bill but as far back as the publication of the Thomson report and now continued here. We have had jokes at the expense of the Glasgow Bar Association because it expresses fundamental opposition. The association is bitterly opposed to the provision in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not so far seen such strong language coming from any legal body. I listened to the authority of the Solicitor-General in his initial remarks, when he stressed the value of this provision, and I must weigh that against the strength of opposition that comes from practising solicitors in the courts in Glasgow and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the Faculty of Advocates—that should appeal to the trade union instincts of the Conservative Members—which also says that it is a further erosion of the right to silence of the accused person. The examination takes place at a time when the accused does not know what the detailed charges against him will be. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spelled that out in some detail, if not in Committee, certainly in discussion outside the Committee—perhaps both—in a series of speeches in which he pointed out that often there may be, for example, a safe-blowing in which all that is known is that it occurred between Friday night and Monday morning, so the alibi becomes impossible for the defence to establish. If the accused tried to explain where he was
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
at a particular time, even with evidence, that could be faulted later because the time would become better known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cannot be sneered at. The arguments must be taken seriously and the authority behind them must be taken seriously. At the moment we have only the authority of the Thomson report and the Solicitor-General to back it up. One of these one may accept but we would be on very sticky ground if we took the authority of the Solicitor-General as sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No corroboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not altogether welcome corroboration from the present incumbent of that noble office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, on principle, the provision must be rejected. Therefore, my amendments will, I hope, be carried. That still leaves a major part of the clause, although I recognise that it makes a big dent in the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the problem facing the Scottish Council of Civil Liberties. Again I quote the council as the authority because it is concerned with this aspect. It points out that the procedure in relation to examination under this section shall be prescribed by act of adjournal, and that despite the full amendments tabled by the Government, the point does not appear to be covered, because the procedures to be adopted, detail by detail, can fundamentally affect the value and objectivity of this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another reason why it would be unwise for us to pass the initial subsections of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other amendment tabled by my hon. Friend. We have had a slight disagreement about subsection (3B) which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sheriff shall delay the examination for a period of 24 to allow his attendance ".</p></blockquote>
I agree completely with that. It should not be left to discretion. It should be mandatory on the sheriff to act. There is an argument about whether it should be 48 hours. I still hope to get comment on this because we cannot let the client go naked into the council chamber—as Bevin once said about Britain—without the protection of a solicitor being present and if 48 hours are needed to achieve that, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The equivalent of a cruise missile. For all those reasons, I hope that my hon. Friends will see their way to supporting the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions have been raised about tape recordings. They introduced a major departure in the Scottish criminal structure. It is so major a departure that I believe that it should not have been introduced as a separate clause of the Bill. If it were to be done, it should have had the apparatus of a Bill in its own right concerned with changing in this way and not merely be an adjunct to other changes in criminal procedures for Scotland. It is a major change, and there is no use claiming the past historic background, because we have altered that also. It is no longer the same structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that it is simply a matter of making sure that the innocent tell the truth and that the accused can be found out in lies. Nothing is as simple as that. As in the case of Paddy Meehan, it often happens that a man is innocent of one crime but may be guilty of another. In the case of Paddy Meehan, I imagine that he found it difficult to say what he was doing that night in the initial stages, until he was actually face to face with the problem of a capital charge. He was about nefarious business. He was "sussing out"—if I may use that term—the social security offices in Stranraer—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Solicitor-General may tell us more. It frequently happens that someone finds himself in difficulty about telling the truth in some circumstances, perhaps because he was guilty of something else, and there is no one in more trouble than a person who already has a record. As everyone knows, if a man is innocent of a charge but has a police record, he finds himself in immense difficulty. This brings inordinate pressure to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden of someone who is away committing adultery—which is not yet a crime, even under this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
his enthusiasm for bringing new laws into the Scottish calendar. It would be a pity if that were introduced, because, sinful though it may be, it is certainly not a crime. I have lost the point I was trying to make in relation to this, but no doubt it will come back to me as we deal with other amendments. I call upon my hon. Friends to support me in these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an instance where, before the courts, it would be said that ignorance is no defence in terms of the law, and those who are not lawyers feel at a disadvantage by comparison with those hon. Members who have earned their living practising law. There are a few points of serious principle that concern the "average punter"—the phrase used by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) about his client, but which also might apply to some of my hon. Friends and me in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find it difficult to accept the principle that if the accused person has the right to silence—and the Bar Association may be going a little too far, as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said—the right to be considered innocent is going by this procedure. We object to that. Therefore I support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). However, his small dent with his amendments might be considered a write-off by a good insurance company, but that may be another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will take up the points raised by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, because my teaching shone through. His speech was clear and eloquent and clearly he has learned a few lessons. He did not learn enough or he would have been on this side of the Committee. But, in essence, he made a passionate plea against this procedure. I only hope that he will follow this through by voting for at least some of the amendments that we have tabled to limit its effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said the procedure should be used only infrequently. He said that it would grind the whole sheriff court to a standstill. That was his first practical reason. I thought that the courts in Scotland were in considerable difficulty already in terms of getting through their work. They will be under even greater
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
pressure with this procedure. The hon. Gentleman said that there were a few instances where he considered that it would be necessary and essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that I do not see in the Bill—other hon. Members who are more expert than I may do so—where it is stated that there will be only a few instances in which it will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that my informal understanding—the Solicitor-General may wish to comment on this—is that it is the Government's intention that this should be an automatic procedure in indictment cases, and that there will be set questions and so on in order to facilitate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn is not present. The Solicitor-General says that it is an automatic procedure. However, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn said that in large numbers of cases the procedure was unnecessary, irrelevant and expensive. His only argument for it was that there were a few cases where it would get rid of some of the waste of public money that occurred in some instances and by doing that he could justify supporting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following his speech the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn can have no justification for doing anything other than voting for the amendments and against the clause. As he said, it will be enormously expensive of public expenditure. His argument for justifying the few cases was that it would save some public expenditure. If all cases go into it automatically, I am sure that he will admit that the public expenditure in terms of the clogging up of and the extra work for sheriff courts is much greater than the small saving that would be made if only a few cases went through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Government supporters are often concerned about public expenditure. In our debate today when we suggested that there should be increased public expenditure, we had it rammed down our throats that we were looking for Utopia, that we were idealists, and so on. We now have another immediately following clause in the Bill in which there will be a massive increase in public expenditure. It seems reasonable that money spent on that which, as the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn said, will be in most cases not only
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
a waste of time but against the interests of justice, would be much better spent on setting up detoxification centres. Therefore, I shall certainly vote with my hon. Friends for the amendments, and later against the clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman slightly misconstruing the terms of the new subsection? Clause 6 (1)(	<i>c</i>), under the heading (3A), says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An accused person may, where subsequent to examination … on any charge the prosecutor desires to question him … be brought before the sheriff for further examination".</p></blockquote>
In other words, there is no obligatory requirement for Crown officers or those acting on their behalf to insist upon a judicial examination as a prelude to founding on some incriminating statement before the trial proceeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I should be happier if that were the Government view—although I still would not vote for the clause if the Solicitor-General confirmed that it was. However, from what I have heard through informal channels—I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden will confirm this—I understand that that is not the Government view. They view this as an automatic procedure that will be carried out in every case. I agree that the clause does not necessarily suggest that. I hope that the Solicitor-General will make the position clear when he winds up the debate. That is what hon. Members such as myself are looking for when we discuss these clauses—clear explanations of the exact position from the Solicitor-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been something of a clause stand part debate. However, it would be fair to the Committee to comment on the amendments in order before I address myself to the other points that have been made by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendments Nos. 131 and 132 were passed, a person could decline to emit a declaration and then emit one immediately afterwards. The amendments suggest that the questioning should be fair. It should not in any circumstances be forgotten that all the questions are under the control of the sheriff. He is the 	<i>juge d'instruction</i>—if we wish, rather inappropriately, to import that continental term. He is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
person in control, and will ensure that the procedure is fair. The subparagraphs which it is sought to delete are all in Thomson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70 makes an extremely rigid proposal, that the examination must be completed
	<br><blockquote><p>"within ten days of the accused's first appearance on the charge".</p></blockquote>
There may well be circumstances in which an accused person would wish to make such a declaration after that time. I submit that it would be extremely restrictive to subject him to such control and deny him the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the procedure, as I have said before, is that the examination should take place on the next lawful day unless the sheriff adjourns the matter, which it is in his discretion to do, for a period not exceeding 24 hours for the purpose of allowing the accused to consult his solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to amendments Nos. 71 and 133. Amendment No. 71 provides that the examination shall be postponed for 24 hours. Again, this is a very rigid provision. The solicitor might be available this afternoon but not available tomorrow. If the accused had 	<i>delectus personae</i> he might insist—as he no doubt would—that of all the star-spangled partners of one firm, only one would do. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is alsmot giggling in anticipation of my mentioning his firm, but assuming that there were other firms that offered such glittering alternatives and the accused nevertheless selected, 	<i>primus inter pares,</i> one of them, that solicitor might be available at midday but might have to leave that evening for Stornoway. He, would therefore, not be available at the time which is rigidly set—namely, 24 hours later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to me to be a drafting point. I plead guilty immediately. If I had realised that that was the burden of the objection, I would have used the words "not exceeding 24 hours" which now appear in subsection (3B). The gravamen of the amendment is to make the delay mandatory rather than permissive—to take out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the accused is brought before the sheriff for further examination it shall be in the power of the sheriff to delay that examination",</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
if the solicitor is not present, and to provide that if no solicitor is present the sheriff must delay the examination for 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the key and the kernel. If the only quarrel between us is the rigidity of insisting on 24 hours when a period of up to 24 hours would be more acceptable, there is no problem at all in adjusting the wording. I would be glad to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that it would reappear in a slightly different form on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said "if the solicitor is not present". The hon. Gentleman is a person of great verbal accuracy and I assume he meant what he said. But all persons who undergo judicial examination have a right to have the duty solicitor present. The only question is whether the sheriff must postpone the examination if the accused says he will accept only a certain solicitor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Donnie Dewar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No,
to remind the hon. Gentleman, the legendary Donnie Dewar was an accused person rather than a solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether the sheriff should be compelled to delay for 24 hours. The accused might wish to delay the examination for 24 hours or for any other length of time in order to have visits from co-accused, suggest what line other people should take, and so on. I therefore see nothing wrong in the court having discretion to say "Yes, it is reasonable that this matter should be postponed until 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, or 5 o'clock this afternoon or 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, while you consult your solicitor", but the accused will always have a right to consult the duty solicitor. There are many circumstances in which such a delay would be reasonable, but there are many circumstances when it might be unreasonable. It is right that the decision should be within the discretion of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 72, stating that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff shall have power to adjourn any examination on the motion of the accused's solicitor for a period not exceeding 24 hours to allow the solicitor to examine any alleged extrajudicial confession",</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
Again, I think this matter is best left in the discretion of the court. It if were a long and complicated explanation of fraud, or of how the accused had not defalcated the funds of his employers, it might be equitable that such an adjournment should be made. At the same time, it could be used improperly as a delaying tactic. Again, I believe that it would be better left to the discretion of the court. There is of course in common law a discretion to adjourn such matters for any time and at any time. Therefore I do not think that we need a rigid legislative rule to make a mandatory obligation. It is important to appreciate that we are trying to have a system of judicial examination that is simple, fair and fast. The more flexibility in the matter which is left, the better, subject to the authority of the sheriff's judicial fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 75, part of which would delete from the examination of the subject of questioning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the matter averred in any charge".</p></blockquote>
That is intended to destroy the purpose of judicial examination and it does not seem to have any merit in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that there is a slight misapprehension in the Solicitor-General's mind. He is right that later amendments on the Order Paper seek to remove any matter averred in the charge but amendment No. 75 merely tries to stop its being returned to on a second occasion. In other words, there would be a restriction to one bite of the cherry, to use my earlier phrase. There is nothing in the amendment to stop the discussion of matters averred in any charge, so long as that is done only at one judicial examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman appreciates that there is a safeguard in subsection 2 (	<i>b</i>) of revised section 20A, that there should be no reiteration of a question which the accused has refused to answer at the examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, with respect, I am trying to be helpful. There are technical points of some importance. The Solicitor-General says: "there should be no reiteration of a question which the accused has refused to answer at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
examination". That might be taken as meaning that the same question could not be asked twice in the examination. One could not hammer away until an answer was produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to preclude the possibility of someone, having asked a question once at a judicial examination and having been dissatisfied with the answer, subsequently—perhaps many days later—holding another examination and repeating the question. I am not sure that that is covered in new subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern about the matter. However, I believe that it is clear from the whole spirit of the revised subsection that such a question would not be tolerated by the sheriff and would not be competent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the only basis on which there would be a second judicial examination is when a new circumstance has to be explored—namely, a new alleged confession, or remarks overheard by prison officers, or some new matter that had come to light. I can think of no circumstances in which it would be tolerated for someone to say, in effect "Ask him a question and see whether in a fortnight's time he remembers what answer he has given by asking him another. Perhaps you will receive a contradictory answer". That is not the spirit of the revised clause. However I promise to look at the matter, because although the intention of the revised clause may be clear, perhaps we could put an absolute bar on such a possibility if the hon. Gentleman is worried about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully appreciate that it is well known in human activity, that if one asks somebody to give an account on Monday and again an hour, a week or a month later and one records those accounts, however honest that person may be, those accounts will differ. It would be very unfair if recollections, differing in time and, however honest, were to become a matter of judicial re-examination or repeated examination and eventually to become a matter of criticism at the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a point on the general matter which was referred to by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming to this as a general matter, but there was some discussion arising from the speech of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) about whether it is expected that this will be a fairly routine happening in all indictment cases and whether there will be some sort of set pattern to questions, perhaps even so far as having a pro forma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Solicitor-General can say anything on the second matter, but on the first one I should have thought that he could have helped us. Obviously, in view of what was said by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn it was a matter of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come to that in time but I am perfectly happy to take it now because that may be for the convenience of the Committee. It is rather difficult to give an assurance without which my hon. Friend seems a little unhappy. In his absence, perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden will allow me to take that in the order I had intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is important to say, if such concepts as are stated, for example, by the Glasgow Bar Association, that presumption of innocence has been removed from our system, that that judgment is based on rather exaggerated concepts. The presumption of innocence and absolute to our system. The man who understands and presumes his innocence is in an absolutely, fundamentally strong position under this procedure. He says nothing then and nothing later. He says "I am innocent. I have nothing to say. I need say nothing." That is a position which can cause no comment whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He says the same if he is guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get into proportion the number of these judicial examinations which, at maximum, could occur. I accept what was said by the hon. Member for Garscadden and my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn. The mornings in any sheriff court, particularly in those of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Hamilton or Dundee, are extremely busy for solicitors, court officers, sheriff clerks and perhaps even more so for procurators fiscal. They are very busy times indeed, I accept that and I know that difficulties arise for all those involved in the work. If I may pay them a tribute, I am astonished that all these people manage to discharge what is a complicated opera-
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
tion daily, weekly and monthly without mistake and with such commendable smoothness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow, for instance, which is probably the busiest court, there are approximately 30 new petitions a week. Therefore, at maximum, we are talking about 30 judicial examinations in Glasgow. When one considers the terms of the clause and the matters which may be inquired into, in my opinion it is not a vast, complicated, accusatorial system, but an inquiry to anable a person to state what is his position at the earliest moment. It was in another place that the Opposition Front Bench spokesman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the accused wants to say that he was at his granny's or that he was watching a football match, let him say that at once".—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 January 1980; Vol. 404, c. 34.].</p></blockquote>
It is infinitely more plausible. The hon. Member for Garscadden will know that nothing is easier than for a prosecutor to say "When did you first think that story up?" The reason that a person is ever advised by a solicitor at present to make a judicial declaration is so that he can say "Not only did I not make it up but I told you at the time and I have stuck to it ever since."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps in the brief interlude for which my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn has joined us, I may turn to the assurance that he wanted. Certainly, it would not be mandatory on a procurator fiscal to hold a judicial examination in every case. Of course there will always be the right of an accused person to emit a judicial declaration. One can think, for instance, of fraud cases, cases of complication, and a judicial examination in which a person was asked what was his position on the charge, and the charge was a 13-page indictment in which he had to explain that in fact the underwear which was ordered from some factory in Solihull had been paid for. If he had to go through endless schedules of fraud, it would obviously be inappropriate. Therefore there will be this right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden said that it was impractical. If he says that it is impractical on the basis of hassle, on the same argument it would be impractical to have Glasgow sheriff court at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with that interesting point, which we may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
want to develop in a minute or two. But let me revert to the assurance that the Solicitor-General for Scotland was giving to his hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) because I find it thoroughly unsatisfactory. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman thought of it. The Solicitor-General for Scotland said that it would not be mandatory to have a judicial inquiry. He then wandered, rather obliquely I thought, into some rather strange remarks about the right of an accused to emit a declaration. In my experience it is a right that is seldom exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not the point. It is not mandatory, but does the Crown Office—the Solicitor-General for Scotland—expect that it will be used in a routine matter, and certainly in any matter in which there has been any sort of reply to caution and charge, or any type of extra-judicial declaration? To say that it is not mandatory is not an assurance to an hon. Member who has advanced a powerful case for saying that it ought only to be used in exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman, and my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn, that the process will not be used only in exceptional circumstances. The whole point of it is to enable the person on petition to state his position with regard to the charge at the earliest possible moment, and to state his position with regard to any statement that he is said to have made, at the earliest possible moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still a little confused. I am having difficulty in understanding the last part of the Solicitor-General's answer. Surely the right to which he has just made reference, in answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), has always been there and has not been subject to any change, intended or otherwise, by this Bill. The question is whether the prosecution will choose to use this opportunity on a universal or on a selective basis. It is the answer to that question that I should prefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The prosecution will use this on a selective basis, but it must be remembered—this is why I made the point—that an accused person might say "It is very unfair
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
because I was not given a judicial examination, and therefore I did not get an opportunity to state my point of view. I have always held to the same story, but you did not ask me to tell you that".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that circumstance that I said that the accused person is not in any different position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should address the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon Mr. Gourlay. The noise of the fan makes one wonder whether anyone can hear what one is saying. I find that my two fans, the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and the one behind me, are sometimes competing for my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked why we should distinguish between solemn and summary courts. There is a fundamental difference between them. When a complaint is issued in summary court, the Crown is ready to go to trial although it may not be possible to fix the trial for that afternoon. But a petition is the precursor or missive of the indictment yet to come. It is very different and it would not be appropriate to have judicial examination in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden also said that people may say nothing. That is their right, but they will say nothing at their peril, if they wish to say something which contradicts what they could have said at the time. [	<i>Laughter</i>]. I see nothing to laugh at. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) thinks that it is a good thing for a guilty person to be able to manipulate the process of the law to achieve an acquittal. I do not think that that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was also raised about a person being in bed with another woman. The hon. Member for Garscadden quoted a volume which has apparently appeared and the case of a person who was hanged because he did not like to say that he was in bed with another woman. If he was willing to go to the gallows to save her, it does not seem a very serious matter to miss out on judicial examination. The accused has only to say that he did not say anything because he was in bed with someone else's wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not read the particular dossier,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
but if the person had, under the stress of the shadow of the gallows, said at his trial "I did not say anything at judicial examination. I was in bed with the hon. Member for Garscadden's partner's wife, and I shall produce her—the hon. Gentleman has many legal partners—that is a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is dealing with a very serious matter. But in the case of potential adultery, which has all sorts of other implications, where someone, for non-criminal reasons is where he should not be, it can lead to difficulties if he has told a lie, either to save someone else's honour or his own blushes. That can then be adduced against him. That is not an unpopular or unknown concept. There is a folk song dealing with exactly that problem called "Long Black Veil." It is an American mountain song.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn also suggested that an accused might reply "Aye, I murdered him," without understanding the difference between culpable homicide and other such crimes. The person is just as likely to say that at caution and charge. Therefore, I do not think that this a is new difficulty. It is a situation in which the accused will be as advised by a solicitor and protected by a sheriff. All the amendments that we have tabled in response to the demand for safeguards in the clause ensure, I believe, that judicial examination will have this effect and none other. It will enable a person to give at the time an explanation of his position which, if it is honest, will surely be consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, a person who has no honest explanation to give but who wishes to find an explanation that will be exculpatory—and I accept from the hon. Member for Garscadden that all of us try to get out of holes and corners when we are in them—will be in a different position. Nevertheless, this batch of Government amendments provide a swift, fair and slick method by which is repreated the great tradition of the law of Scotland judicially to examine a person, to ensure that the innocent can immediately give their innocent explanation and the guilty are not allowed the safeguard of preparing it, with or without the advice of colleagues, conspirators or anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the Solicitor-General's use of the alliteration "fair, fast and flexible" when describing the procedures in the debate on the amendments that have been tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and other of my hon. Friends. I was anxious to hear the Solicitor-General's reply and to hear whether he would give the assurance that his hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere in anything said by the Solicitor-General was there any indication of the kind of assurance that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn put the relevant point about the judicial examination being used as a matter of course on indictment cases. The Solicitor-General answered "No" and said that it was to be used only selectively. I was very interested in the choice of the word "selectively" because, in effect, that means that one can select every case on indictment in which to use this procedure of judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we have to speak during the absence—the temporary absence, no doubt—of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. I thought that earlier the Solicitor-General had made the point clear by implication. He said that in the Glasgow sheriff court there were 30 new petitions each week and, therefore, I should have thought that implied that at the maximum in that court there would be 30 judicial examinations. The Solicitor-General then enlightened us with the alliteration "fair, fast and flexible".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Solicitor-General and all hon and learned Members on the Opposition Benches, of all people, know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
that it is not the view of the Faculty of Advocates that this procedure will be fair. Certainly, it is not the view of the Faculty of Advocates that this procedure will be fast, nor is it the view of that body that it will be flexible. Indeed, the Faculty of Advocates is on record as saying that the whole question of judicial examination will be a great field for legal debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, I am concerned that those who are charged with offences and are guilty should be brought to trial and properly convicted and that society should be properly protected. We are all interested in bringing the guilty to trial. I am equally concerned, as I said on Second Reading, with the abuse of the legal aid fund in Scotland, particularly by those in the legal profession, where clients plead not guilty and almost the day before the trial starts change their plea to guilty after a substantial amount of legal aid has been involved. I am concerned that that problem should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly in the last five or six years I have argued that that abuse of the legal aid fund in Scotland which, although I have no figure, I strongly suspect is nearly £1 million each year, must be dealt with. If judicial examination can deal in part with that kind of abuse there is something to be said for it. But while I am in favour of bringing the guilty to trial and having them convicted, I am not in favour of a trial within a trial. I see the Solicitor-General shaking his head and clearly there is a division of opinion between us. But as this procedure on indictment cases develops there is a great danger of a trial within a trial, particularly where the accused person can be brought back again for a second examination, although I accept that the second examination would be an examination of a statement made or a confession given. I do not believe that that is in the interests of lawyers or those who practise law. Nor is it in the interests of the Scottish legal system as we have known it down through the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I was anxious to hear the Solicitor-General give some assurances, but they were not forthcoming. Secondly, I am anxious to hear the Solicitor-General say to my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden that the safeguards sought in amendment Nos. 70, 71 and 75 are acceptable safeguards. I am also anxious to hear
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
the Solicitor-General accept these safeguards because I am certain that the Government are convinced that they do not have this matter right. If they did have it right, why, out of the 35 amendments to this clause, are 23 of them Government amendments? Any Government who believe they have legislation right do not table 23 amendments to one clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, when your successor, Mr. Gourlay, takes the Chair, as we understand will happen in the not too distant future, that consideration will be given on clause stand part to the fact that the Government have tabled 23 amendments to this clause. I accept that many of the amendments are set against the background of assurances and concessions made in the other House. Nevertheless, if the Government felt that they had the matter right, or nearly so, we would not have seen emerging on the Order Paper this whole cluster of 23 amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to fully concede that all these amendments are safeguards. That is why I cannot understand why the added safeguards proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden are not being accepted. Although my hon. Friend is opposed to the principle of judicial examination because it removes the right to silence without prejudice to the accused—a not unimportant issue—nevertheless my hon. Friend in his usual helpful manner is very keen to assist the Government in introducing added safeguards and to remove a fairly massive area of discretion which now lies at the hand of the sheriff. We must view this against the background of the advantages and the way in which the advantage has been swung firmly towards the prosecutor on the one hand and the sheriff on the other. Whether that is good or bad is a matter for another debate, but I am sure that the Solicitor-General would admit that there has been a swing in advantage away from the accused person and towards the prosecutor and the sheriff. That area of discretion which the sheriff has is causing concern, and I had, therefore, hoped that the Solicitor-General, in a generous mood, would accept at least some of the amendments. Even the amendment that he told my hon. Friend was defective in drafting could easily be redrafted to include the words "not exceeding 24 hours", and would have met the Solicitor-General's point. If that was all that was wrong with the amendment, I should have expected
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
the Solicitor-General to say that the Government would table a redrafted amendment on Report along the lines that he indicated. But that is not what the Solicitor-General is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped, also, that, as we went through the debate, we should hear evidence, particularly from hon. and learned Gentlemen on the Opposition Benches, that this provision would speed up the legal procedure. The Faculty of Advocates does not believe that for a minute. Although the faculty does not say so specifically, if we read carefully what it says, the faculty is implying that the procedure will slow down the legal process of bringing someone to trail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General had here an opportunity—as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is so fond of saying—to look further down the brief. I hope that it is not too late for him to have a second look at the part where it says "If pressed, agree to consider" or, further down still, "If pressed even harder, agree to accept ". If he will just turn over the page, I am sure that he will find those words on his brief. I have been reading the debates with great interest. I wish that I had kept all the briefs that I had, for, if the Solicitor-General would just pass them over, I think that they would be much the same. If I could have passed mine to him it would have saved the Civil Service a great deal of work. Nevertheless, the Solicitor-General had a good opportunity to accept some additional safeguards to a principle with which I am prepared to go part of the way because of the abuse of the legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West says "Oh". I am sure that he understands my point about the abuse of the legal aid system and how people change their plea very late at tremendous cost. Perhaps I am being presumptuous in not giving the Solicitor-General an opportunity to say what I had hoped that he would say. Perhaps he will say it on clause stand part. I give notice now that I shall probe further the matter of the additional legal aid costs that will be involved as a result of judicial examination. I shall leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an opportunity, even at this late hour and as the debate is coming to a close, for the Solicitor-General to accept at least some of the amendments and further to improve the drafting of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
clause. The Government have accepted that the clause is not perfect, because they have tabled 23 amendments. We are merely extending those 23 to 25, 26 or even 27. What are four amendments between friends at 11 o'clock at night? I feel sure that the Government will be prepared to accept them, even at this late hour. If they are not, I advise all my hon. Friends to press the amendments to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate but, unfortunately, as is the way of contributions from the Solicitor-General, his remarks have raised as many questions as they have answered. It is late, perhaps, to return to some of those questions, but I know that the Conservative ranks have been encouraged by Whips and by the visit of the charismatic figure of the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor). The Tenants Rights (Scotland) Bill had the Prime Minister, but we have had to make do with but a shadow. For all that, it is good to be remembered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). He spoke at length about his schooling and was good enough to remind me that, if we had not been pupils at the same time, we at least shared a common alma mater. He showed the advantages of an expensive education by being paired and leaving us to the horrors of the night. His arrival in the House of Commons will be much welcomed by the governors of my old school because in the last Parliament there was only one Conservative Member, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), from that school; there were two Labour Members who have both survived the election, and one Scottish National Party member who is no longer with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrival of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn leaves the situation at 2:2, which I think must have been a considerable consolation until the rather unbalanced electorate in the Glasgow Academicals club. By the way, I do not count my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who only got in by way of pieces of silver, one might say. He is not really an Academical by breeding at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now turn, very briefly, to the important points that have been made. First, I am not yet at all clear—I mean that genuinely—about how often the judicial examination will crop up. I was amazed,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
but I totally accept the statistic, that there are only 30 new petition cases a week in the Glasgow sheriff court. I did not realise what a small cake the solicitors' profession was fighting over. I will now approach the annual count, in the firm with which I am still associated, with a good deal more realism and, perhaps, a little more satisfaction when I look at the total that we managed. But, given that there are only 30 new petitions a week, I still think that it is important to get some picture of what Ministers envisage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn has shown a wise discretion in departing. If he had stayed he would have been in an invidious position. He eloquently argued that this was a mechanism of some value. I do not want to misrepresent his position. He made it clear that at the last gasp he found reasons for saying that. But he said that it ought to be used only in exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now it has become clear that this will not be mandatory. We gathered that from the Solicitor-General. But, after all that, there is mystery. I honestly do not know what it is, but I suspect—I am very certain in my suspicion, if I may take the phraseology of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)—that it will be a routine procedure and will become part of the scene in the Glasgow sheriff court, or any other sheriff court, and I believe that it will be an extremely difficult one to administer and maintain. I may be wrong, but that is the firm suspicion that has been left with me by the Solicitor-General's equivocations—I can use no other word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that the Solicitor-General was finally saying that, rather than exceptions being the cases that went through this procedure, complicated cases such as fraud would be the exceptions that would not go through it, rather than the other way round? Most of the cases would be standard. There would be a few exceptions for complicated cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with that. That was the clear impression that we were left with. I take it that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn did not get the assurance that he was seeking. I am sorry that he is not here to carry his little rebellion—his small tentative approaches to the edges
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
of rebellion—to its logical conclusion when the vote is called on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also not at all clear on the form that all this will take. Is there to be a set of questions? Is there to be a pro forma approach? I am not at all clear about that. I do not know how long we expect this procedure to be in each case. It will certainly be a considerable impost on public funds. There will, presumably, be some calculation of how many extra procurators—fiscal will be required. There will be a reference, in the financial memorandum, to the costs of those who will take the shorthand records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another small thing, that perhaps the Solicitor-General will answer in a later debate, is whether the accused will be on oath. Although I gathered from what he said that the accused would be on oath, that is not specifically written into any of the clauses so far as I can make out and I think that that is something that we should know about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that others may have different interpretations, but as someone who has constantly practised in sheriff courts in central Scotland, I believe that if I ever do such work again regularly I shall find myself in grave difficulty with clients. I shall be dealing with confused clients who have just been brought in on serious charges. They will have been held in the cells overnight. They will have been spat out from Barlinnie into Glasgow sheriff court, into what I describe as a Hogarthian scene up in the cells. They will not have a petition for a long time. They will get the petition with, apparently, a copy of any extra-judicial confession which is alleged, attached to it, probably only minutes before they have to appear in court. They will be confused. They will have no idea of the implications or the niceities of what constitutes a special defence and what particular peril they put themselves in if they do or do not give advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is up to the solicitor to try to put it into perspective for them, but I warn the Committee that the terms and conditions in which we operate in sheriff courts in Scotland will not allow the process to be done properly. People will put themselves in legal peril, because they will not be properly advised—not because there is a lack of expertise from those who try to advise, but because there are neither
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
the conditions nor information available to allow the advice to be properly imparted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the result will be that the standard of justice in Scotland will deteriorate. It will not be dramatic. I am not talking here about undermining the whole system, or even of the total revocation of the right of silence. It is an encroachment upon it. It is a retrograde step and one that we could well do without. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that it will lead to a great deal of confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice, as he did, that the Faculty of Advocates said in paragraph 2(1) of its memorandum, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Implementation of this clause will provide a fertile source of legal argument in trials".</p></blockquote>
We do not need any further fertile sources of legal argument. There are enough real issues in attempting to get to the truth in our legal system without importing this clumsy and, I believe, unworkable and unrealistic concept, which was dreamed up—I believe in a well-intentioned way—some five or six years ago, but which in a period of examination and contemplation by the legal profession has been unanimously rejected by every one of the major legal institutions since it was first proposed. It is a remarkable piece of prejudice and obstinacy that persuades the Solicitor-General to cling to a legal baby which no one else wants and which we could very well do without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concluded my second intervention in the debate by saying a word or two about each of the amendments and what I hope the Committee will do about them. I am informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that he intends to divide on amendments Nos. 131 and 132 and I shall have no difficulty in joining him in that venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say a word or two about the amendment, that stand in my name? I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the comments and partial explanations offered by the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, for example, amendment No. 70, which the Committee will remember, tried to put a time limit between the first appearance of an accused in court and the day on which judicial examination took place. That amendment was dismissed by the Solicitor-General on the grounds that at some future date, after an initial judicial examination on the first lawful day, there might be a further statement by
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
the accused which would require a further judicial examination. That is a remarkably unlikely scenario, and if there is such a scenario in which the accused, of his own volition, or persumably on the advice of his solicitor, says that he wants to make a further judicial declaration, the whole apparatus of judicial examination in those circumstances would become irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of judicial examination is to test the validity of what may have been a blurted out extra-judicial confession, which the person, who is perhaps innocent—we are always talking in terms of "innocent" in the Solicitor-General's speeches—may want to qualify or explain. It is a catch mechanism to catch the person who has no valid explanation by forcing him to speak at once, or an opportunity for the innocent man to put a proper gloss on what might otherwise, uncommented on, be a statement open to damaging interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand that argument, although I do not accept it. But if at a later stage an entirely voluntary confession is made when the accused has legal advice, we do not need this catch mechanism. Therefore, it seems that it would be much safer to take out of the proposed legislation the possibility of having two bites of the cherry, which looks a little like double jeopardy, or the possibility of double jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not satisfactory for the Solicitor-General to say "Certainly, it is possible that that could happen in terms of the drafting of the statute, but I do not anticipate that it will happen." The Solicitor-General cannot superintend every judicial examination, however Hurculean his efforts in the Crown Office. I should have thought that it would have been very much better, given the context in which the second judicial examination could occur in his own terms of reference, to exclude judicial examination altogether and leave it that it should take place on the first lawful day after arrest. That is why I believe, despite what has been said, that there is a good deal to be said for amendment No. 70. I am not entirely convinced by the Solicitor-General's explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 71 is of particular importance and I certainly wish to divide the Committee on it. The Committee will remember that when the Solicitor-General came to explain why it was not acceptable, he based his argument largely on the fact
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
that it referred to an adjournment of 24 hours while in the subsection which we are attempting to substitute there is the phrase "not exceeding 24 hours." The Solicitor-General made great play of the fact that by saying 24 hours simpliciter we were writing in an unacceptable inflexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of interpretation, my view is that an adjournment of 24 hours would allow the court to have an adjournment of less than 24 hours. The point is not a good one anyway, but even if it were, it is as clear as crystal that we can meet it by changing two or three minor words interpolating the words "not exceeding." The point of the amendment is to turn what is a permissive clause of moment into a mandatory clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on at great length about this. The case is clear. The Solicitor-General was, I believe, deliberately going down a cul-de-sac in an attempt to avoid his difficulties and to find good reasons for rejecting the amendment. Paragraph 7.5 on page 11 of the memorandum of the Law Society of Scotland says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council considers that the position in respect of delaying the examination must be clarified, and that the words 'the Sheriff shall have power to delay' should be altered to 'the sheriff shall delay' in relation to attendance of the accused's solicitor".</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the amendment I have tabled. It is supported by the Law Society's and the objections advanced by the Solicitor-General were not advanced to the point of the amendment. I certainly hope that the Committee will join me in pushing this successfully to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3D) The sheriff shall have power to adjourn any examination on the motion of the accused's solicitor for a period not exceeding 24 hours to allow the solicitor to examine any alleged extrajudicial confession or other statement made by the accused or to advise him as to any category of defence that might be relevant".</p></blockquote>
Again, I am not clear why the Solicitor-General should object to that. I found no substantial argument why the amendment should be unacceptable. The Solicitor-General told us that this was already within the discretion of a sheriff. That may well be in a general common law sense. I cannot see why, in the thicket of statute law which is being imported into criminal procedure in Scotland by the Government we should not have this little additional safeguard spelt out. If we were in an area
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
where we were relying on common law and on custom, habit and repute, I can see that it might be wrong suddenly to try to firm up one little area of safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are not in that situation. The Government are legislating in a sweeping way, where every dot and comma is included and every "t" stroked and every "i" dotted. In those circumstances, I see nothing wrong in giving the sheriff that power specifically. It is not a mandatory power. It is a permissive power. It merely ensures that it is clear that the sheriff shall have the power to adjourn in the sort of case about which the Solicitor-General was talking so eloquently. It is the kind of case which takes us perhaps into the realms of complicated fraud, where there is a long and extra-judicial confession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not forget that the Government are insisting on going on with clause 2 without the safeguard of tape recording. Extra-judicial confessions which will be the subject of judicial examination will not tell what actually happened but what happened as recounted by a police officer. That is not necessarily a criticism of the police. They must adduce the writing and put in a gloss or precis—no doubt trying to be honest and accurate—of what happened when the person was being questioned or the extra-judicial confession was being blurted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, where there are no tape recordings, the right of the sheriff to adjourn for up to 24 hours to allow examination of a complicated and unusually significant and important judicial confession or other document, is only common justice and common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was speaking earlier, the challenge was made in relation to tapes. I have now found the reference from the Thomson report on page 45 paragraph (b) in which it is assumed that the proceedings will be taped. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the accused is alleged to have made answers to the police questioning during interrogation, these answers if made at a police station will have been recorded on tape".</p></blockquote>
In other words, Thomson assumes that from the very beginning of the process, any questioning will be taped. That must be considered before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That reinforces my point which goes back to the deeply mistaken decision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
by the Government Front Bench not to accept amendments that would have ensured that large parts of the Bill did not come into effect until tape recording was available. I say that with genuine regret. If that had been done it would have shortened these proceedings. Therefore, the Committee can imagine that the regret is genuine. We must live with the Conservatives' obstinacy my only regret is that they could not be a little more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered the amendments and explained why I find the Solicitor-General's explanation unsatisfactory. Obviously this is only the first of a large number of amendments that we shall consider on clause 6. No doubt we shall have extensive debates on a number of them later. Some of them are of extreme importance and will have to be taken in some detail. But as we have had a fairly wide-ranging debate, I shall finish on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the Solicitor-General who, in an extremely polished court style, and with considerable surpressed passion, argued that the innocent man had nothing to fear and that it was a useful way of ensuring that the guilty suffered the consequences of their wrong doings. That is a general proposition from which I do not dissent. But I am not clear whether it will be helped greatly by judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the essential point that the crux of the Solicitor-General's argument was that judicial examination gave the innocent man a chance to make a statement establishing his innocence right away. That is a powerful argument because there should be such a mechanism, but it is a powerful argument only if one assumes that the only way in which that can be achieved is by the introduction of this machinery and judicial examination. If there is a need to make such a declaration to establish one's innocence, it can be done immediately, without jot or tittle, under present procedure without a word, line or clause being added to the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Solicitor-General has advanced a particularly valid criticism of present court practices. As someone who is a solicitor in Scotland—I still occasionally practice my trade—I take his words seriously. It is almost second nature for me when I represent someone at a first hearing to say "I appear for the panel, my Lord. No plea, no declaration. I have a petition for bail." Perhaps I should think before using the words "no
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
declaration" and should instead say that my client is presumed innocent, and perhaps is innocent, and we might establish that innocence by making a declaration inder the present machinery. That is a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is wrong that the right to make a judicial declaration has fallen into desuetude, as it has. In defence of solicitors I believe that experience would not support that in a wide number of cases. The conveyor belt system we run in busy sheriff courts in Scotland—as I said, like suffling through in the baker's queue—does not encourage one to stop and consider. It is almost impossible to do that because of the hurry, pressure of business and shortage of resources. That is the realistic position. I am glad to see the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) nodding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of our clients perhaps we should make more room for that. Perhaps we are open to criticism. But the fallacy in the Solicitor-Genera'ls position is that we could do that now. We do not need this clumsy, expensive and confusing legislation which I believe will make justice more cumbersome, more expensive and which strikes essentially at one of the important root rights of the criminal procedure system—the right to remain silent without being penalised for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General has either missed the point of the amendments or, in his desperation, slid past it in the hope that none of us would notice. In his central defence he has rightly put up a good case for machinery to help the innocent establish their innocence, but he has misled the Committee in suggesting that the only way in which that can be done is by implementing this machinery. The machinery already exists. Consequently, the whole ingenious intellectual house of cards which he tried to erect before our eyes has collapsed and fluttered to the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for this innovation is not proved, and given all these demonstrable shortcomings and difficulties the Committee should ultimately throw the clause out. But in the meantime we should adopt the useful and important, although not necessarily fundamental, safeguards embodied in this batch of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
