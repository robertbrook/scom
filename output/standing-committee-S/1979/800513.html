	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 3, line 36, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and provided that no answer given shall be admissible in evidence in any trial of the person unless the prosecutor shall, at the first examination before the sheriff under section 20(1) of the 1975 Act have put to him questions calculated to enable him to make any denial, explanation, justification or comment he may wish to make in respect of answers given by him while detained under the provisions of this section of the Act".</p></blockquote>
I need not detain the Committee long on this amendment, the purpose of which is to implement paragraph 7.22a of the Thomson report. The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We 	<i>recommend</i> that nothing alleged to have been said to or in the hearing of the police by a suspect or an accused shall be admissible in evidence for the Crown at his trial unless it has been put to an accused at a judicial examination."</p></blockquote>
The last sentence of that section states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If an accused has to make that challenge within a day or two or even a few hours of making the statement, this would reduce any chance of police unfairness to the accused and also of false challenge, so protecting the police against unjustified attacks upon their integrity."</p></blockquote>
If, as has been claimed—although I cannot now remember who claimed it—the Bill is to implement the Thomson report, this amendment could provide the protection envisaged—that is of fairness to the police. I hope that the Solicitor-General and his colleagues will be able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment which the right hon. Gentleman has moved would make inadmissible any statement given by a suspect during the
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
period of detention unless the alleged statement was put to him at his subsequent judicial examination. The Committee will be aware that judicial examination is now a feature of the Government's proposals. It was not part of the previous Bill and, therefore, the situation would not have arisen as the right hon. Gentleman indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 on page 6 at paragraph (	<i>b</i>) provides that one of the purposes of judicial examination should be that there should be put to the suspect
	<br><blockquote><p>"the alleged making by the accused, to or in the hearing of an officer of police, of an extrajudicial confession (whether or not a full admission) relevant to the charge"</p></blockquote>
and there is a special proviso that questions under this paragraph may be put only
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the accused has, before the examination, received from the prosecutor or from an officer of police a written record of the confession allegedly made".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is intended that in all normal circumstances the matter should be put to an accused at juducial examination and he should have had the opportunity to see in advance any statements that are being made. Therefore, there is no disagreement between myself and the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) as to the normal procedure that should follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reluctant to go as far as the right hon. Gentleman wishes because his amendment would have the slightly more extensive effect that if, for any reason, it had not been put to him at judicial examination, irrespective of whether there had been complete fairness, even whether the accused himself admits that he made the statement, it would not be possible at a subsequent trial to lead it in evidence. That would seem to be going unfortunately far. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman may not have realised the change that was made in the Bill in the other House. Some of the points to which I have just referred were introduced into the Bill only as a result of the debates in the other House. Therefore, I think that the Bill, as it now stands, meets 99.9 per cent of the substance of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. I hope that in these circumstances he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
6 drawn to my attention by the hon Gentleman I am quite happy that it largely bears out the effect which I wish to achieve with this amendment and I am quite content to withdraw it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 3, line 36, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and that all questions put to the person and all answers made by him to such questions at the police station or other premises under subsection (1) above, shall be recorded on tape; and that no evidence of such questions and answers shall be admissible in evidence in any subsequent proceedings except as recorded on the tape that the transcript thereof.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also consider amendment No. 26, in page 4, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Any questions put to a person and any replies given by him while in detention in a police station detained under subsection (1) above shall not be admissable as evidence in any subsequent trial unless they have been tape-recorded or video taped and the said tape recording or video recording and a transcript thereof is lodged as a production in court.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is yet another of the amendments tabled against the background of a proposal with which we disagree in an attempt to secure some safety for an accused person, for a suspect or for a detainee in the whole chain and process that is to be set in motion by the Bill—a process leading eventually to judicial examination and trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tendency for the Thomson report, the answers we have been getting from Ministers and general comments from the Government side to say "After all why the anxiety, we can always rely upon good police practice?" Part of our anxiety comes from the fact that societies have been destroyed in the past through relying merely on the practice of police behaving well. History is littered with societies in which this has been found to be insufficient. This is especially true at present—the difference between modern tyrannies and past tyrannies. Modern tyrannies are worse precisely because they have such an apparatus of technology and power that the previous inefficient tyrannies could allow liberties by default. One compares the present Soviet tyranny and previous czarist tyranny. The present
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
Soviet tyranny is worse precisely because it is more efficient as the apparatus of a State bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against this background that we are concerned to write in what safety we can for the liberty of the subject within these proceedings. We have had enough cases in recent history to know how easily this can be proscribed. We shall be discussing the question of detention in a more principal way under other amendments, but many of us have to record here our detestation of a system of arrest and questioning which is not subject, as the Thomson Committee says, to normal safety that comes from the formality of arrest itself. Indeed it is almost precisely within this situation that our amendment and the following amendment, No. 26, become crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion we have great authority behind us. We may disagree with some of the argumentation of the Thomson report, but certainly those who accept that argumentation cannot then reject those measures which they see as essential if their proposals and argumentation are accepted and the proposals carried out. On this one we have almost a gospel authority. Paragraph 7.13c does not merely say "We recommend", it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Interrogation of suspects in police stations must be recorded on tape."</p></blockquote>
This is probably the strongest phrase used in the course of any of the recommendations. This is an essential. At that point it says that it will not tolerate—not allow the process of questioning to take place without the safety and security of tape recording. I draw attention to that four-letter word "must". It is the first time that it is used in a report in that way. Clearly, enormous stress has been placed upon it. "Must" is highly categorical, and if we are to accept, as the Bill accepts, the argument of the Thomson report, it is an essential concomitant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the presence of this will not satisfy us with regard to the proposals. But it is a 	<i>sine qua non</i> of their acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be told that we can rely only on police practice. We are placing an undue burden on the police and I should have thought that they would be the first to seek the security of their own actions and their own questioning being taped. The Solicitor-General when in Opposition warned us more than once during the proceedings on the previous bill that this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
kind of complaint, the kind of challenge to police evidence and the kind of denial that takes place about questioning, can only increase under these new proposals, if we do not have the security for both the police and the suspect that will come from tape recording. We are concerned not only with the liberty and security of the subject, but with the good name of law itself. We are on the side of law and order and of good policing care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument that I do not wish to hear is that, as the Government are instituting a trial period with tape recorders, we can go ahead without them. We are firmer than that. We are saying that we cannot proceed without tape recorders. I hope that the Government will accept that proposition. They can rest on the Thomson report for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it be expensive? I should be the last to complain about their saving money but, as the Thomson report points out, tape recorders and tapes are comparatively cheap. The manpower needed is probably less than that needed for recording an interrogation in typescript. There is no reason to reject it on the basis of cost. I should like to see it extended to videotape. On that we have good allies. We have that bold spokesman for individual liberties, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not regard video as a must. I want what is said to be taped. I should prefer the videotape process and we hope that it can be extended to that under the terms of the damnable financial resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the skeleton of my case. We shall argue it at greater length when we hear the Minister's reply. I have immense confidence that he will agree on the spot, conscious as I am of the Government's awareness of the likelihood of continual challenge in court proceedings, an awareness underlying the speeches of the Solicitor-General when in Opposition on the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a great deal between the two amendments, but there is one difference. Amendment 26 contains the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"while in detention in a police station".</p></blockquote>
I should like to go a little further. That is why we have said that all answers and all questions.
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the police station or other premises … shall be recorded on tape".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
In other words, it would place a minor limitation on the police right to question before the tape recorder was there or in the police station where they had a tape recorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to be told that this will break down law and order in South Uist, Barra and Benbecula because they are a certain distance from the police station.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no crime there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) says that there is no crime there under his leadership. Crime has been cut down, presumably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Extirpated perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Considering the way in which the right hon. Gentleman has been voting over the last few weeks, I have no doubt that "extirpated" is the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We stand by the point, however, that questioning should not take place without the tape recorder, but now an element of security is involved even in this. We shall leave it until the debate on another clause, to get the response of the Minister because I am sure that he will already have in his mind the recommendation of the Thomson report that such tapes should be sealed. I do not believe that the tapes will be tampered with. Who would ever believe in the century of Watergate that tapes would be tampered with? However, at some later stage we shall seek to provide that they be properly sealed until they are produced at the court proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will rest on this point. We have made the skeleton of the case; we will argue it at greater length when we have heard the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support in broad terms my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). There is a distinct amendment in my name and in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). It is important that the distinction be made. My hon. Friend the member for Renfrewshire, West pointed out very clearly that there are a number of differences. One is that his amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
as I understand if would limit the use of the power under clause 1, unless the questioning that took place under the provisions of that clause was tape recorded. I think that may be a little hard for the Government to swallow, and I am genuinely anxious to give them every possible opportunity to accept an amendment with which I know they have a great deal of sympathy in principle. I recognise that there are difficulties about remote areas where a serious crime may occur and where, for what they consider to be very pressing reasons, the police may wish to exercise these powers but may be inhibited from doing so because they are far from a police station and from tape recording equipment. I think that we should limit the safeguard; I think it would be more practical if we confined ourselves to having it when the questioning is taking place in a police station. Of course there would then be the possibility that people would seek deliberately to conduct questioning outside of police stations, but I can see a line of cross-examination which would be extremely damanging to the admissibility of any extra-judicial confession, or which would certainly influence the jury, if the questioning took place within easy reach of a police station where such equipment was available. I think if it makes the measure more workable we should restrict ourselves to saying that if questioning takes place in a police station and it is not recorded then it should not be admissible. I think that would be the easiest formula for the Government to accept, but I would stress the self-evident point that this would achieve nothing if the person was in the police station on a genuinely voluntary basis. In fact it would do nothing to restrict the police from using their existing powers under common law. However, one of the attractive features of the tape recording provision is that in circumstances totally divorced from the clause 1 compulsory powers tape recordings could be used to clear up ambiguities, allegations and confusions which are often so hard fought, with professional skill, by people such as the Solicitor-General in his private days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that by way of brief introduction because I hope that here we are knocking on an open door. I hope that there is unanimity on the need, in principle, for tape recording. I think I detected just the slightest hint of a nod from the Under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
Secretary; he is a man of great restraint and it was almost imperceptible, but we may tempt him out from the undergrowth into the open in a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking through the debates on the Labour Government's Bill I find the speeches of the then hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, (Mr Fairbairn) now the the Solicitor-General, a much more rewarding quarry for digging out useful opinions. These are genuinely useful opinions, though, sadly they are not held to. Occasionally they are denied not once, not thrice but five times, but still they are on the record, and they are some consolation to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General will remember— he will find the references in columns 160 and 165 of the Official Report of the Committee stage of the Labour Government's Bill—that when we were discussing the principle of clause 2 the hon. and learned Member went out of his way to stress that I need not worry about it because it must be seen in the context of the determination of the Conservative Opposition to ensure that there was tape recording of any such questioning. In his final passage on this matter he referred to the Lord Advocate's remarks, and said that the Lord Advocate
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied me that the common law and the safeguards for the citizen in a police station will be considerably weakened."</p></blockquote>
That in itself is an interesting opinion about the effects of clause 2. He goes on—and this is how he consoled himself,
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am satisfied, as I hope members of the Committee will be, of the necessity for our amendments which introduce the tape recording of such statements". [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1979; c.165.]</p></blockquote>
That was fairly strong and unequivocal. He admitted that the position of the civilian was being weakened but he said that that merely convinced him of the necessity of the Conservative amendments, which were plain amendments to introduce tape recording on the lines which we are presently discussing. The hon. and learned Gentleman was absolutely right in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In col. 195 where the Tory amendment which introduced tape recording was moved, we had some very persuasive—I say that frankly—arguments from the hon. and learned Gentleman as to why it was an essential safeguard. He has a great deal of talent as a mimic and, in his usual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
way, he introduced a little play-acting into the Committee. We had a dialogue recreated from the High Court and also a dialogue of what might happen in a police station. Although it was—and was meant to be—entertaining, there was a serious point that there is a danger that people will make allegations against the police and he made the point that it might therefore be argued that the tape would be used for this purpose. The conversation would be interspersed with "Oh, if you hit me again, constable, I will admit it" and so on. The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to say very properly that that was a very slim danger indeed and was more than outweighed by the enormous importance of the safeguard that a tape recording would provide. He made the very important point that we want to know not just the answers which a person gives but the questions which elicited that answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This goes back to the judgment in Rigg, which the Committee will remember was discussed earlier, that what one gets inevitably is a filtered version—tidied and cleaned up—of what was said. I make no objection to that. It is almost inevitable in the situation. In Rigg there was a 700-word coherent and flowing statement which the judge properly in that case thought did not have the necessary air of spontaneity and versimilitude, and which he therefore rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the kind of danger where the absence of tape recording can obstruct the workings of justice and perhaps allow someone to slip through a gap in the net, when in the interests of justice they should not be able to slip through. It is of immense importance to the police because it will lay stone dead the possibility in most cases of allegations of irregularity and brutality and it will ensure that the court knows whether leading questions were put. It will also be an important safeguard—this was also an argument used by the hon. and learned Gentleman—for the less articulate. We shall be able to pick up the very intonations and weighting of the words which can sometimes so dramatically change a meaning. We shall get away from the fascinating discussions about the meanings of words and the proper meaning which ought to be put upon a word—was it a joke or was it meant seriously, was it ironical or not—which sometimes detain the High Court of Justice for many happy hours
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
and puzzle and confuse a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which was absolutely properly made by the hon. and learned Gentleman was that it was a safeguard for the police and an aid to justice and it will ensure that we have a much more efficient and safe system in this particularly difficult area of extra judical confessions of verbals and so on. Of course it was not just the Conservatives who were particularly keen on this. In principle, at least, we carried my hon. Friend the Member for Sterling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), who is now on the Opposition Front Bench. My hon. Friend made it quite clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"We"</p></blockquote>
—he was speaking of the then Labour Government—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are committed to the principle of tape recording". [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979; c.208.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West did a very good job in underlining the fact that there is a categorical Thomson recommendation. It was part of a package. We have had some rather devious attempts—and I am sorry that the Under-Secretary was once party to this—to suggest that when Thomson went along with the concept of detention, he did not include tape recording as a necessary part of the package, and that in some way one could have one without the other. No doubt the Committee is familiar with these passages. It is as plain as a pikestaff that Thomson said the one went with the other, and that it would be dangerous to take one part and reject the safeguards. We are in a position of happy unanimity on the principle. I hope that we shall hear from the Minister that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must now turn our attention to the important part of what I have to say, the practicality of whether we can overcome the evident difficulties. We know that an experiment is going on in England and Wales. We know from the extremely eloquent and, very effective speech of the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) during Second Reading that certain people not noted for flighty revolt on the Conservative Benches, who have a genuine interest in this field, are—to put it bluntly—sick and fed up with waiting for the results of that experiment. The hon. and learned Mem-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
ber for Darwen referred to a wait of eight years for some sign of results from the investigation being made south of the border. I am not sure whether it is eight years, because I picked up a reference in a ministerial speech in the last Committee to the experiment's starting in 1974, but I will not quarrel with whether it was 1972 or 1974. It was certainly well over half a decade ago, and we have got absolutely nowhere with it. I can appreciate the irritation of the hon. and learned Member for Darwen, which led him to abstain on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful for being reminded about this, but the point is even stronger.

There is no personal attack behind this on the integrity of the Minister if he tries to give us assurances, but all Ministers are undermined by Civil Service inertia. Things just do not happen. Years pass, and Ministers come and go. It may well be that by the time the Under-Secretary sees actual results of the Scotttish experiments he will be watching them from another place down the corridor, or he may be standing in the queue for his old-age pension. We want to know a great deal more about the time scale if we are to be given any plausible assurances. I remind the Committee that on the Labour Government's Bill my learned friend the hon. Member for Falkirk, Stirling and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), referring to the English experiments, made the following statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is expected that the results of the English and Welsh experiment will appear later this year so that we shall nave some firm indication of the feasibility of tape recording of interrogations later this year from that source."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979; c.207.]</p></blockquote>
He was speaking in 1979, but I have no doubt that Ministers will have been making sure that that information would be available by the end of last year. We are due some clear indications as to what has happened to the English experience and what conclusions we can now draw from it. If the Minister does that, we shall be
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
able to draw the hon. and learned Member for Darwen's attention to the findings, and it may be some consolation for him to know that at least the experiment is alive at this time.

I should like to raise a number of other points at this stage. We may well be told that cost is important. In the House of Lords the Earl of Mansfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One noble Lord said that the cost would be minute. It is right to say that so far the cost has been very far from minute. In order to obviate some of the dangers of tapes being doctored, if I may use the expression, it was thought proper that each machine should make three tapes simultaneously, one to be sealed and sent to the procurator fiscal's office, one for use by the police and one for the suspect, if eventually he was arrested, and his legal advisers."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps, in passing, because the experiment is running and therefore the rules must be formulated, the Minister will confirm that that is right, because there was certainly a rumour in legal circles that although there were indeed to be three tapes, one was not in fact, to be available to the defence as of right. The implication I draw from the Earl of Mansfield's statement is that it is rather like the second blood sample under section 6(1). Assuming that the man is charged it will go automatically to him and be available to the defence. I would be interested to know whether that is the Government's present practice in the experiment and whether, if we get to the point, as I hope we will very quickly today, we shall get an assurance that we shall be moving quickly to a universal tape recording system. I would be interested to know whether that is the Government's long-term intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Earl of Mansfield went on, I presume to show that he was aware of modern social habits:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The machine therefore is far from the little cassette thing with which my teenage daughter makes the night air hideous with her cassettes."</p></blockquote>
perhaps not the most eloquent of sentences but we know what he means—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is complicated. Perhaps I can tell your Lordships that the eight sets of equipment in Dundee and the four sets of equipment in Falkirk have between them cost no less that £37,000."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords;</i> 29 January 1980, c. 771.]</p></blockquote>
That is quite a startling figure, I agree, particularly when we remember that in the Thomson Committee report it was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
reckoned that a suitable piece of tape equipment would be £25 to £75. Even allowing for inflation, an increase from £25 to £75 to the kind of figure that is buried in that £37,000—which I reckon means over £3,000 per piece of equipment, seems to me to require some sort of explanation. I would have thought it possible to do it more cheaply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite as sensitive about the doctoring of tapes as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West. It is very hard to doctor tapes, as rather more skilled people than I have discovered, and from the point of view of the police there is no possibility of the accused doctoring them. If we worry about it, it must be in terms of police practices and I think we can probably exaggerate that. If there is a tape which does not reveal something which a client says ought to be revealed, I would imagine that in those rather unusual circumstances an examination by an expert of the tape would almost certainly reveal cuts. My memories of Watergate arguments rather underline that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point my hon. Friend is making, but there are ways of doctoring tapes other than actually putting a pair of scissors through them. One tape can be recorded on to another and passages can be deleted. The experts might find it much more difficult to tell whether there had been doctoring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that these precautions are necessary, but the kind of figures that Lord Mansfield was mentioning seem to me to be on the heavy side financially. In any event, I would like to be satisfied that there really are these difficulties. My scepticism would be well and truly shared by the Solicitor-General who knows a good phrase when he hears one and said in Committee on the Labour Government's Bill, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should not have thought that it was a terribly difficult or lengthy business to experiment with a tape recorder. In fact, I should have thought that any amateur or 'ham' wireless operator would have a perfectly sensible and watertight system going by this evening. So the idea that somewhere, if a new Marconi is born, perhaps we shall be able to invent a method of recording the human voice in the sanctity of a police station seems to me to be putting the matter a little far ahead."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 1 February 1979, c.210.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think we need the sarcasm of
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
calling for a new Marconi or even necessarily enrolling a horde of amateur "ham" radio operators, but I take the point he makes. I do not think it should be beyond the bounds of ingenuity to ensure in a comparatively short period that we have a proper system in the principle police stations of Scotland which would allow the Thomson detention proposals to run in tandem with the Thomson safeguards of tape recording. The two must go together and it is unsafe to introduce one without the other. The dangers of not introducing them together were obvious to Conservative hon. Members when they were on the Opposition Benches. They are obvious, judging by his interventions in the House, to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) judging from what he said at an earlier Committee sitting let me just remind the Committee—I know one can get tired and bored of quotes from the previous Committee stage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member is not often tired of listening to his own voice, but it appears that when it comes from an outside source it causes him some pain and distress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I have not been misunderstood. When I indicated that I was tired and bored, it was with listening to the hon. Member's voice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member is bored in his own words. I would like the hon. and learned Member to know that my last perhaps ½ minutes will be largely his own words and I hope he will give them due weight when we come to the reply. It is to be found in column 211. It was a point that I myself suggested in the previous column that we
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider as a solution the powers in clause 55"</p></blockquote>
—that is, in the Labour Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which allow different provisions to be brought in at different dates?"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979; c. 210.]</p></blockquote>
by order of the Secretary of State. I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
making what seemed to me to be the self-evidently sensible suggestion that if the Government insisted, let them have the clause 2 detention powers—I did not like them, but if we were to have them, all right put them on the statute book—but we should have a guarantee from the Secretary of State or an amendment to the Bill to the effect that they would not be implemented until tape recording was available to run alongside those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I put this to the Committee hon. and learned Members wholly now the Solicitor-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should be very glad if the Minister would give that assurance. I am more than happy to allow him time to think about giving it. I do not ask him to give it now, but it would seem to me that he can give it before Report. If he would be good enough to write to me on the matter, we could consider what amendments to put down on Report. It is a very important question."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1979; c.211]</p></blockquote>
I am always glad when something that I raise in Committee gets such a ready recognition from Conservative Members. It was rather a good tradition of that Committee. There is painfully little evidence of it in this one. In fact there was a good deal of across-the-Floor participation. The point is that we could very easily have that suggestion now endorsed—the suggestion which was greeted so enthusiastically by the Solicitor-General. It would be the simplest thing in the world for the Ministers to say that they had not changed their mind on this point and that they will give a guarantee that they will not move the implementation order under clause 81 until they have completed what the hon. and learned Gentleman argued so eloquently was a perfectly practical possibility of ensuring that tape recording was available and ready when these powers was implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to say that we are unanimous on the principle. The way forward was very clearly and simply set out by the Solicitor-General when he was in Opposition in the Committee stage of the previous Bill, and I genuinely hope that we shall have some sign that the Conservative party now in Government is prepared to stand by the perfectly sensible principles that it enunciated in Opposition only a few short months ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
amendment No. 26 to which I give my qualified support. I am deeply concerned at the aspects of detention on two counts. One is that I believe it is necessary to give the police the powers to carry out their duties properly and effectively. Secondly, I believe that we must do it in such a way that there is no question of civil liberties being infringed in an unacceptable manner. It may come as a surprise to some Labour Members, but there are those of us on the Government side who care very much about civil liberties and it is a fact that we have to balance civil liberties between the kind of civil order that we seek and the kind of State in which we want to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to the 	<i>Police</i> magazine dated April 1980, that is Vol. XII No. 8. It says there:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No fewer than one hundred and eighty-four police officers above the rank of inspector are now wholly or mainly engaged in the investigation of complaints against the police. The total cost this year of employing these officers on this work is £2,750,000. The figures apply to England and Wales only. They take no account of the cost of the Police Complaints Board."</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to this because although I have no comparable figures for Scotland, I am fairly confident that there is a substantial cost element to the public in pursuing this kind of activity. Anything we can do to reduce this would be a saving to the Government. I know that we are operating within the terms of the Money Resolution, but I also believe it necessary to look carefully at what is going on. I should like to think that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary in his reply will be able to give me some assurance on the question of the use of up-to-date equipment to assist the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On second diet in Scotland there are many pleas of guilty. To reduce the number would mean a saving in the cost of bringing witnesses, police officers and others to these trials. I have a letter from the Solicitor-General dated 23 April which states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in 1978 on the date set aside from some 30.172 trials to proceed, some 16,580 (or 55 per cent) pled guilty. Similarly in 1979, on the date set aside for some 23,921 trials to proceed, some 12,662 (or 53 per cent) pled guilty."</p></blockquote>
There are areas there where, if we had the sophisticated modern equipment that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
is available, there could probably be reductions in those numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that these are all possibilities and that on one can say categorically that savings would be made. But one would expect people to be more reluctant to face a second diet if they knew that the true position was properly recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the advantages of video equipment over normal tape recording. The issue of allegations against the police should be taken seriously by the Committee. It would be more difficult to doctor tapes or to make allegations against the police if video as well as audio equipment were used. A combination of the two makes it extremely difficult to doctor tapes and almost impossible to bring allegations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am horrified at the cost of conducting the two experiments in Scotland because I know what modern electronic video equipment costs. It cost £37,000 to install the present test equipment in two stations. It certainly would not be that much if one bought in quantity. One could go to any of the manufacturers of this modern, sophisticated equipment and do a deal if one were buying for every police station in Scotland. That would have the additional advantage of bringing work to hard-pressed United Kingdom factories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the advantages of video? At the Tory Party conference Grampian television was using modern equipment called ENG—electronic news gathering, which means that there is no need to man the cameras and so on. The same sort of thing could be carried out in police stations. It is the kind of equipment which is used extensively in industry to carry out surveillance and for training purposes. I have had experience of both uses and I can confirm that the equipment is reliable and most effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport said recently in dealing with vandalism and rowdy behaviour on tube trains in London, that funds would be made available for law and order and that television cameras would be placed in London tube stations. If it is possible to find the funds to control this kind of activity in London, it surely would be possible to find the funds for the kind of equipment which would be of advantage to the police in Scotland and would protect the public against the kind of abuses to which hon. Members are quite rightly drawing attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases involving allegations of abuse by the police are often worsened by the fact that extravagant claims are made by both sides. That is rather sad. What people want to see is an effective system of policing which would mean that the guilty would be brought to trial and convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point which I made earlier in the debate. I believe that if we could find a way of introducing this modern electronic equipment—and I look to the Minister to give an assurance that this is being considered seriously by the Government—it would be sensible to link that to a 24-hour detention period. I believe that that would balance both aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in his remarks indicated his surprise that the experiment in tape-recording in England and Wales seemed to be taking much longer than originally intended. I can only comment in passing that, after the hon. Gentleman said that he would only speak for two or three minutes, he spoke for another 17. That seems to indicate that matters sometimes cannot be kept under proper control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may address myself to the specific question of tape recording. I say at the outset that the Opposition are correct that the Conservatives when in Opposition rightly raised the subject of tape recording when the whole issue was being considered in the Committee on the previous Government's Bill. We put down an amendment and we pressed the then Government to give some undertaking about tape recording. We withdrew our amendment only when the Government of the day undertook to accept the idea of tape recording and to initiate experiments to see whether it was practical. We accepted the arguments of the then Government that it would be right to wait until the end of these experiments to see whether there were any practical problems associated with tape recording. If no such practical problems arose, tape recording should be introduced. That remains our view. The Government's view quite firmly and quite clearly is that, if the tape recording experiments which are presently being conducted in Dundee and Falkirk are shown to produce no insuperable difficulties, it is our firm intention to implement these proposals at the earliest opportunity. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
do not see the question of resources as significant in implementing such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disagreement in principle that tape recording is highly desirable and appropriate. The Government's intention is that the proposal should be implemented unless these experiments introduce fundamental and insuperable objections which we do not expect and which the evidence so far does not suggest will come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the Committee some information on the experiments which are at present being conducted. The hon. Member for Garscadden asked what would be happening to the three separate tapes which were being used in the experiments and to whom they would be made available. The hon. Gentleman is almost correct in his assessment of the situation. One of the tapes is to be kept by the police; one is to be sealed for use in court if necessary; the third tape is to be made available for the procurator fiscal and the defence. The defence will have a complete right of access to the tape: to listen to it and use it if it so wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) made some interesting remarks and suggestions about the possible use of video tape either as well as or instead of tape recording. This is a very interesting proposal. At the moment the experiment which is being conducted is solely confined to tape recording. My hon. Friend will accept that the cost of tape recording is significantly less than video, although it is impossible to give a firm estimate of the cost of either. If the tape recording is shown to be unsuccesful or inappropriate or undesirble, clearly we shall have to give considerations to alternatives such as video. At this stage we hope that tape recording will prove to be sufficient and satisfactory because that will clearly meet the general points which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point which I ought to emphasise to the Committee is that if, as we hope, the tape recording experiment is a success it does not require any legislation to introduce and implement. I say that quite categorically. It was said by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) when he was Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. Quite clearly the situation remains that the implementation of tape recording—or
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
indeed video recording for that matter if that were thought to be appropriate—would not require legislation. Therefore a final decision can await the completion of the experiment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is on the practicalities of the experiment being carried out in Dundee and Falkirk and in response to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) who asked whether work would be produced for British factories and British workers, can the Minister tell us the make of the equipment that is being use in Dundee and Falkirk? Is is home-produced or foreign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is British equipment, though I am not sure what the name of the firm is. A competitive tender was used to get the best and most economical arrangements for the experiment, and I understand that British equipment is being used. I will check on the details of that and let the hon. Gentleman know, since he is interested in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) expressed a genuine concern about the possibility of interference with the tapes and clearly that is why we are contemplating using three separate tapes. He also mentioned that even with tapes it was possible either to remove or to add to parts of the conversation which give a misleading view as to what the suspect had said. We have built into the experiment a timing device which will indicate the total length of time that the tape is meant to reflect. In other words, by removing part of the replies that a suspect might have made, or by adding new material the total length of time that the tape covered would be different from the time indicated by the timing device, which would clearly be an indication that there had been some interference. So the timing device has been built in as an extra safeguard to deal with the possible problems which the hon. Member for Cathcart and the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West quite rightly referred to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a most interesting point. My concern about the use of tapes is that the suspect could say "Stop hitting me, stop hurting me", and that would be recorded. There would be no way to tell whether that was a pretence, whereas the use of video equipment would eliminate that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept my hon. Friend's point. It is a question of the level of safeguard that is feasible. I raised that possibility with the police officers at Falkirk when I visited the experiment that is being conducted at the police station there. I asked them how they would react if such an allegation were being falsely made. They said that they had considered that, and that if at any time a suspect made a false allegation of that kind, the police officer conducting the interrogation would simply record on the tape at that time "The suspect is at this stage making an allegation against me which has no foundation." I accept entirely that that does not produce conclusive evidence as to who is telling the truth, but it would assist the court when considering the truth of the matter. It is a difficult point and it is exactly the sort of practical problems that the experiment is all about. No experiment would be needed if there were no practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Gentlemen referred to the cost of the experiment and the cost of the eventual tape recording, if and when it is implemented. While at the moment there are three separate tape recorders built into the unit, producing three separate recordings, one of the things that we shall wish to consider is whether a single tape with a fast copier might be sufficent as this could reduce the costs involved. The costs do not simply relate to the tape recording equipment, however. They also include, for example, the need to sound-proof certain of the rooms that are being used, and this extra factor has to be taken into account. As I said earlier, I am impressed by the response so far of those police officers to whom I have spoken who have been taking part in the experiment, who seem to have found it reasonably straightforward, although it is still at a very early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested in the remarks of Sergeant Joe Black of the Police Federation when he appeared on a television programme with my hon. Friend and with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), when he indicated that, from his point of view, speaking on behalf of the Police Federation, it appeared not to have any fundamental objection to the principle of tape recording, and that it was interested, as we all are, in the practical aspects that might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with the amendment we are concerned with an additional and import-
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
ant point. Let us assume for the moment that the tape recording experiment is successful and is implemented. The point is then whether any statements that have not been tape recorded can in any circumstances be admissible. The difficulty, as I see it, would be in the remarks made by the hon. Gentlemen in speaking to their amendments. I have not the slightest doubt that on some occasions a suspect will decline to have his remarks tape recorded. He may be perfectly willing to give comments to the police, and to reply to questions, but in certain circumstances, perhaps for no good reason, he will be suspicious of the tape recording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the police have already indicated to me that at the moment some suspects object to having their remarks tape recorded. They say "I am quite happy to answer questions, but I am not going to have it on that tape recorder." They are being illogical, because the remarks will be taken down in a notebook and from that point of view they are in a position of no greater security, but they may be concerned that their tape-recorded remarks might be played back to an accomplice. They would not be, but nevertheless that is what they may fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may be suspicious of what looks like rather sophisticated equipment which they do not understand. It would be highly undesirable if, in a situation in which a suspect was perfectly willing to answer questions, and had vital information which was perhaps concerned with a very serious crime, something written into the Bill made an admission given under these circumstances inadmissible in evidence, when it might be crucial to the necessary court proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This can clearly be taken care of by the Government. We have to go through the Report stage, and it is perfectly appropriate to table an amendment which says that where a suspect declines to answer with a tape recorder, and so testifies, he may be told that that is permissible. The pressure here is on the police questioning side rather than on the suspect's side. There is no reason why, with the skill and ingenuity of the combined Front Benches, we cannot get the appropriate amendment. If not, my hon. Friends and I will draft one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give consideration to the general question of whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
amendments of that kind might be appropriate. That was simply an example which I gave. At this stage I am saying that to have an absolute blanket barrier is not entirely appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is making a serious and, I accept, genuine difficulty in the amendments. Does he not think that there is some attraction in my alternative proposal that we should obtain an undertaking from him that he will not implement the clause 2 powers until the tape recording is available? After all, if the experiment is going well, presumably he would expect it to be over within a year. At that stage it would be a comparatively simple installation job. Why not get rid of the need for the amendments, with their drafting difficulties, by merely giving an undertaking that he will not implement the clause until tape recording is installed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental problem of the difficult and delicate relationship between a Secretary of State and chief constables. When we are dealing with the day-to-day use by individual police constables of their legal powers approved by Parliament, the Secretary of State cannot give directions to chief constables of the kind that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Apart from that, we have to examine what will apply under the Act compared with the existing situation that applied when suspects are at a police station. There are already today at this moment, in a large number of police stations in Scotland, suspects technically assisting the police with their inquiries, but with all the unfortunate, undesirable aspects of the present situation, which are recognised by all concerned. The remarks that are made in these circumstances are admissible if they meet the genera test of fairness and the general questions of admissibility of evidence as considered by the courts. To say that once the Act is on the statute book any statement made at a police station, however fair, however much it is recognised by the courts as having been made in acceptable circumstances, should have a blanket statutory ban on admissibility would not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Under-Secre-

	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall come into force on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint by order made by statutory instrument; and different dates may be so appointed for different provisions or different purposes."</p></blockquote>
I am suggesting that when the Bill is enacted clause 2 should not be activated until we have the tape recording 	<i>in situ</i> and ready to run in tandem. The effect of that would be that there would be no change in the law and compulsory detention would not be a power open to the police until this important Thomson safeguard was available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make a reasonable suggestion and it is put forward in that spirit. The difficulty is that it does not meet the point that I made earlier about the situation where a suspect genuinely refuses to have the tape recorder on while he is making his response. That is an issue which will apply even if tape recording is ultimately introduced. If a suspect declines to give any information or to reply to any questions if he is to be recorded, clearly it would be ridiculous that his replies which would be otherwise forthcoming and which might produce very important evidence should be inadmissible for that reason and that reason alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is the Government's intention that if the experiment is successful we should implement tape recording. Such evidence as I have so far has not yet revealed any insuperable difficulties to tape recording. We will come to a preliminary conclusion within six months of the experiment having begun. The experiment began on 1 May; we would expect within six months to have come to a preliminary conclusion as to the success of that experiment and it would not take much longer than that six months to come to a final conclusion. Therefore, we are not talking about seven or eight years' delay which might or might not have taken place in other parts of the country. We are talking in terms of a few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that even if we introduce tape recording, the Government's view is that any statements made without tape recording should be admissible. Let me give another example to the Committee. Let us assume that the tape recording equipment simply broke down in a remote
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
police station where there was no opportunity to get other equipment. I do not accept for one moment that if a suspect was willing to give evidence and perhaps was anxious to give evidence, that that important evidence, perhaps in a crucial murder inquiry, should be unavailable to the court simply because the equipment had broken down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister is making rather heavy weather of this. My hon. Friend the Member of Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has put forward a very sensible suggestion which meets the objections he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, my hon. Friend is saying that clause 2 should not take effect until the tape recording facilities are available. That means that the essential safeguard, which I understand is included in Thomson, is retained. The Minister seems to be saying that there will be problems meantime, but I do not think so because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said, the existing law will continue to apply to arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other objection that the Minister seems to have is that those who do not want tape recording will not be allowed for, but surely a drafting amendment can be made to deal with that. That will be a part of clause 2 which will not come into effect until the tape recording is available. That will not force anyone to have tape recording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would press this very strongly and I think this is a way for the Minister to be very helpful on this issue. Perhaps he might consider at this stage giving an assurance, or if he cannot give a categorical assurance now perhaps he could say he will look at whether at a subsequent sitting he could, having consulted his colleagues and anyone necessary, give as assurance that clause 2 will not be implemented until the tape recording facilities are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether that will be regarded as a brief intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. You will recall that you ruled out of order amendment No. 142, which would have had precisely that effect, on the ground that it fell foul of the financial resolution. We have now been assured by the Minister that the introduction of tape
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
recording would not run foul of the Money Resolution and that there is no problem there. Clearly amendment No. 142 is now relevant to the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not of itself propose anything. It merely allows the existing arrangements to be retained until recording is introduced, without any dispute or discussion as to whether the suspect wishes it. It therefore seems that your reconsideration may be given to that amendment at this point, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position has not altered, although certain words have been used in the Committee. I think that we should now proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). Although his intervention was not brief, it was certainly constructive. He will appreciate that the question of when individual clauses take effect comes under clause 81 and is clearly something that the Committee will be able to consider, we hope, in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have raised are certainly worthy of consideration and I am happy to undertake to consider them, with my hon. and learned Friend, very closely. We shall have an opportunity on clause 81 to consider the implementation of either the whole Bill or individual clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point about which the Government feel strongly is that even if, as we hope, tape recording is implemented as a normal procedure, it should not be an absolute statutory requirement to which there can be no exceptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to note that this is now a matter of agreement in the Committee. I am happy to undertake to look at the points which have been raised before we reach clause 81, which deals with the implementation of individual clauses. We can then have a full discussion on the merits of the particularly interesting proposals put forward this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we have been through this matter before, and one of the things that worry me when we debate an issue that arose on the last Government's Bill is the lack of progress that we have made in the meantime. I do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
not particularly blame the Government for the lack of progress on the introduction of tape recording experiments. When I was a Minister I gave the undertaking that these experiments were about to start and, lo and behold, they did not start until 1 May 1980. I think that it was the present Solicitor-General who came away with that famous quote in the Committee on the last Government's Bill that a civil servant is someone who will find a problem to any answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While all these assurances have been given by the Under-Secretary that the experiment is going ahead in both Dundee and Falkirk and that the Government expect to reach a preliminary conclusion in six months and a firm conclusion soon afterwards, I fear that in two, three of four years' time we shall still be discussing the introduction of tape recording of the interrogration of suspects in police stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister says, it is not unimportant. We are talking not only about the evidence that is given and the statements made by the suspect, but about the manner in which they are obtained. As the Solicitor-General himself said on the last Bill, leading questions are not permissible and the answers to leading questions are not admissible in evidence. How on earth are we to know if leading questions are put? The present Solicitor-General, when e was shadowing the job in the last Parliament, gave fairly lucid examples. He pointed at my then right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate, now Lord Murray, and asked whether, if he were asked whether he was in Committee room 9 of the House of Commons with his hair untidy on the morning of 1 February considering the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, that was a leading question. The then Lord Advocate said "Yes" to that question: he was answering not one question but four or five. Law Officers and untidy hair are two things that go together because the same question can be put this morning. In answering such a question the Solicitor-General for Scotland would be answering a leading question and would be answering not only one question but a series of questions. So here I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that we are not only talking about the answers which are given to the questions which are asked but about the questions themselves and the method of obtaining the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
I was a bit surprised that the Under-Secretary said that there was no need for legislation. We must get this point clear. When the Under-Secretary came to the end of his remarks, he seemed to give me the impression—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) had the same impression—that the question of tape recording of interrogations would be entirely voluntary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is why I am raising the point. It is very important that we get it clear. If the Government take a decision to make the tape-recording of interrogations in police stations obligatory, my understanding is that that needs legislation. In fact, during the passage of the last Bill I was advised to give such an answer to the same question. If the then Government decided to make the tape recording of the interrogations obligatory, I was advised to say that it could be done by circular without legislation, merely by advising police officers that the Government would like them to tape record the statements made during the interrogation. When we took that a stage further, we were advised at that stage that, if the Government made it obligatory to tape record evidence, that would need legislation. My understanding is that, if the tape recording of evidence is made obligatory, there is no question but that it will need legislation. That is a very important point for the Minister to clear up before we come to a decision on these amendments. If that is not the position, it has changed somewhat since we considered the previous Government's Bill. Everyone on the Committee, including the now Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary were of the opinion at that time that, if tape recording of statements made in an interrogation were obligatory, that would need legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very important with regard to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about whether clause 2 should be implemented in advance of the tape recording of the statements made during the course of an interrogation. If it needs legislation, my hon. Friend's point becomes even more serious. We ought to clear that point up because my understanding is that it will certainly need legislation if the tape recording of statements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
made during an interrogation is made obligatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the equipment, I have noticed the Minister being passed a note from his back-up team which he did not read out to the Committee. I suspect that contained in that note is an indication of the type of equipment which has been installed at Dundee and Falkirk. In the meantime I have made my own investigations and I understand that certainly the equipment at Falkirk has been manufactured by a firm called Neal and the equipment itself is called Ferrograph. That does not give any indication as to whether it is British or foreign equipment, but no doubt the Under-Secretary will tell us. As an aside, I should say that a mere name does not indicate that it is made in this country. I have a Philips tape recorder which is made in Austria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shocking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not mine. I borrowed it from my hon. Friend the Member for Gascadden, and I will give it back to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that point, I am anxious that the whole question of whether we need legislation should be cleared up. I am anxious also that the Minister should say something about the method of obtaining the statements that are made by the suspect because if I share anything with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker)—and I assure the Committee I share precious little with him—I share the view that it is necessary to protect the police from unfair untrue allegations that are made about what goes on in a police station when a suspect is being interrogated about an offence that might have been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also think that the point that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire made about the complaints against the police is something that we will obviously come to later in the Bill. It is a very real point and I know that the hon. Gentleman is very much aware that the position in Scotland is totally different from the position in England and Wales. We do not have the Police Complaints Board, or anything like that. I hope that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, having seemingly said that a police complaints board is a good thing, would support my hon. Friend for Renfrewshire
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
West (Mr. Buchan) and my colleagues and I when we suggest that there ought to be some similar kind of independent element in the handling of complaints against the police in Scotland. We will see how that debate goes when we reach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worried as I am about the delays that took place when I was a Minister, I remember the then Solicitor-General saying to me that I really ought to chase the civil servants much harder on this issue, get them working and, make sure that these experiments took place quickly, and see that the results were given to the Committee, I was told that action was needed in order to allay the fears of the many people who thought that tape recording was the answer to clause 2 problems. Yet here we are more than a year on and the experiment has only just started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Government have started these experiments and we look forward to the results being made available, but I hope that the Minister will make sure that there is no backsliding in this instance—and I am not criticising the Minister here—that no one at any level is allowed to put up excuses why they cannot do this or do that. If there are good and valid reasons, then so be it, but I hope that one will be allowed to put up excuses as distinct from good reasons why we cannot get ahead with the introduction of the tape recording of the statements that are made during an interrogation. Having said that, I am not sure whether my hon. Friends would want to press this amendment to a Division, but, no doubt, my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, will want to say something else on this very important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit dowm, I would again press the Minister on this question of legislation because it is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman. May I first indicate the situation with regard to the origin of the equipment that is being used. The contractor is a firm called Tyne Video of Scotland Limited of East Kilbride; the microphone is produced by Millbank Microphone and the recorder and playback by Neal Ferrograph. These are all British firms, the Committee will be happy to know. The only part of the equipment not of British origin are the cassettes which are BASF C90 cassettes. This is a German company, but hon. Gentlemen will be interested to know that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
equipment is actually manufactured in Singapore. Therefore, at least the Commonwealth is involved, if not the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the delay in the experiments beginning and I share his disappointment that it has taken so long to get these off the ground. There was delay because of the difficulty in obtaining competitive tenders and also delays in the delivery of the necessary equipment and the preparation of the accommodation, but the experiments have begun and we can now look forward to an early response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about the need for legislation. Nearly, if there was to be a legal obligation to use tape recording that would require an Act of Parliament. There cannot be legal obligations without a statutory Act of Parliament. But there is no doubt that if the Secretary of State issues a circular to chief constables saying that this is the Government's policy, it is unthinkable that chief constables would decline to respond. If for some inexplicable reason they did decline, the procurator fiscal, who comes directly under the Lord Advocate, could decline to consider any evidence which had been brought without the use of tape recording without any good reason. So in practice there is no problem about this. The Government—as in a number of other areas—indicate to chief constables the Government's policy on a matter of this kind and then it is perfectly normal, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will concede, that chief constables would not dream of acting other than in accordance with the Government's view on these matters, and that should be acceptable to all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I hope, with these remarks and particularly in view of the assurance I gave to hon. Gentlemen in my previous contribution, that we can proceed with the Bill in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the Committee and I must say, on my own behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of others, that we have been encouraged by certain moves forward that have taken place, which are in line with the points made last year in the Committee considering the Labour Government's Bill. We rgard this matter as very important. We regard it as
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
important enough to reiterate that we do not believe that these powers should be implemented in the absence of tape-recording facilities and in the absence of a statutory use of these facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with two points. The first concerns the accuracy or otherwise of tapes. Of course there are problems; of course it is possible for the suspect to say "I will admit this so long as you don't arrest my mother. Please keep my mother out of it, don't arrest her." The classic case which has gone down in history is the one in the Soviet Union where Stalin was speaking in Red Square, and a little man rushed up with a telegram. Stalin said: "I have just had a telegram. It is from Trotsky and it says 'You were right and I was wrong. You are the true heir of Lenin. I am the enemy of the people'. Signed, Trotsky." The wee man who had delivered the telegram, who happened to be Jewish, said, "Look, you've got it all wrong. What he is saying is: 'You are the true heir of Lenin? I am the enemy of the people. You were right and I was wrong? Signed, Trotsky."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intelligent criminal who fakes his own evidence was mentioned. He is in a knee-jerk situation and the policeman says into the tape recording "At this point the suspect is making an unfair allegation that I am putting a knee in his groin." I do not think that would happen with most people; I do not think that is a serious problem. Besides, like any other evidence, it is subject to examination and cross-examination in due course. So I think we are agreed on the matter of tape recordings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then come to the problem of the suspect. Our view on this was in the interest of justice and of safeguarding the individual involved in a process which is without full legal redress and safeguards, especially during detention. We are not concerned here with the imposition of a duty upon the suspect but the imposition of a duty on the criminal procedures, in this case upon police procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that if someone, for whatever reason, has a strong objection to being tape recorded we must consider that aspect. But we must also make sure that the process cannot be abused, that we cannot have a situation in which the police could say "We have not tape recorded this, because the suspect refused to be tape recorded" when it was in their own interest not to have a tape recording. Such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
a safeguard must be written in in some way—that the suspect objects and so testifies in some form or another that he has objected, and that objection is sustained. It seems to me that if we do not do that and the question arises, under the judicial procedure or at a later stage, the whole case couls fall if the suspect began to deny that he had ever refused the use of a tape recorder. That seems to begin to require legislation. I do not believe that we can rest this matter simply on a circular and guidance to chief constables and the conduct of the procurator fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendments are defective. Most Opposition amendments are, as we know to our cost. What we must get into the legislation is a provision that unless the suspect objects tape recorders must be used and the police cannot question the situation. I believe that that requires legislation. I do not accept from the Minister that at present it does not. He says that it can be done sufficiently in practice. We always have this sort of argument from Ministers in power, against introducing provisions into legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should bring this matter into legislation, if only because of the massive pressure of opinion in legal and academic bodies, and bodies concerned with civil liberty. It is important, sometimes, that legislation is made in order to give greater comfort to the legists. The legists are particularly anxious about the proposed terms of the Bill. For that reason alone, while legislation is necessary, it is also desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to the problem of how one is to do it. We have had very good assurances from the Minister, and without those assurances we should have pushed this to the vote. I am prepared to leave it until Report and come back at that stage to see what further emerges in relation particularly to clause 81. I am concerned whether, if we leave the matter till clause 81, we can get the proper formulation thrashed out, because if I were faulted on amendment No. 142, on the technical constitutional position that this could not be brought in here because of the Money Resolution, I find it difficult to see us writing it into clause 81, even though it came from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Government are entitled to do that and I cannot. The Chairman assures me that that is the position. The Government themselves can bring in an
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
amendment regardless of the Money Resolution, whereas we cannot. We have that kind of resolution in amendment No. 142—at least the concept of holding the process until recording facilities are universally provided. That, along with the assurances of the circular, is coming a long way to meet us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Under Secretary for his assurances, and we now see a clearer and more likely course of action to be accepted. While reiterating our position, which is that it should not be implemented without tape recording, and that the only objection to tape recording is when the suspect objects that is absolutely clear as being our intention I am prepared to recommend to my hon. Friend's that we withdraw the amendment at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been spurred on by my hon. Friend for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and his story about Stalin and Trotsky. Perhaps more in the realms of practicality is the reminder by the Under-Secretary of a recent High Court trial in Scotland, in which there was an extra-judicial statement to the effect "I demand an identification parade. I was wearing a mask when I did it." The interesting thing about it is that I understand that an ingenious junior counsel persuaded the jury that it had been said in a joking spirit, and the man was acquitted. It may well have been that there was a sneaking suspicion at the back of my mind that if we had had tape recording and the context had been seen, it might have been far clearer to members of the jury whether it had been meant as a joke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had these assurances. If we had pressed this to a vote I do the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) credit of thinking that we would have won it. It would not, however, be fair to do so because of the problems of drafting. That is something which the Under-Secretary will think about when he considers whether he should give substance to his consideration on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unusually, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and myself have perhaps more in common than some of the rest of the Committee, in believing that videotaping is a much better way of doing this than tape recording. I ask that the Min-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
ister considers this very seriously, both in view of the practicality in terms of cost and in terms of the better way of actually having the questioning recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the cost, if one takes the equipment which has so far been described, having three simultaneous recordings on tape as opposed to one video recording, which is all that, in my view, would be required I am prepared to accept that there would be policemen with the technical knowledge to tamper with a tape recording, although even that is not easy. But all who have had anything to do with radio broadcasting know how cleverly the tape editors can do it when they take out all the "ums" and "ahs" and the rest. They are very clever—I accept that. There may be policemen who can do that sort of thing, though I accept that very rarely would they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even on the timing, if one asks one question and the accused gives an answer, it is possible to take out that question and put in another which makes the answer appear totally different. If one keeps the words the same and the length the same, one can make it sound right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we substitute for those three simultaneous separate recordings one videotape recording, only one piece of equipment is needed in each police station because it would be almost impossible for the average policeman, or even the technological policeman to tamper with a videotape recording. Therefore the cost of the videotape recording may not be any greater than the sort of cost about which we are talking, and in fact may be less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also takes account of what we have heard from my hon. Friends on the matter of what people are actually saying. I accept that tape recording gives a better impression of what is actually said than does the written word. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West used the example of the telegram from Trotsky to Stalin. If Trotsky had actually been there and there had been a video recording of it, one would have seen him doing it and using his hands. It would have been clear from his face, his body position and so on that his meaning was totally different from that which Stalin had taken. Although tape recording is better than the written word, video tape would give a much better impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
I am happy to go along with my hon. Friends in withdrawing the amendment, but I shall look carefully at what the Government are prepared to do on Report. I ask them to take very seriously the points that have been made about video recording. It gives greater protection to both the police and the detainee. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire and I may be looking at this from two different ends. He may be more concerned about protecting the police and I may be more concerned about protecting the detainee. But we are both coming to the same conclusion—that both would be better protected if we had video recordings than if we had simple tape recordings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ber for Renfrewshire, West, (Mr. Buchan) set a good example in the last debate by merely painting the bare bones of the amendment and allowing the debate to develop from there. From that position, we were able to obtain certain assurances from the Minister that enabled the Opposition to withdraw the amendment. I propose to follow that practice now by merely painting the bare bones of this amendment. I hope that the deabte will develop from there and that at the end the Committee may come to an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are anxious to find out why it has been necessary to put paragraph (	<i>c</i>) into the Bill. It was not in the Labour Government's Bill. It certainly was not spelt out in the specific terms in which it has been spelt out in this Bill. We are anxious to know why the Government feel it necessary that when someone is detained under subsection (1) the police should take fingerprints, palmprints and any other prints that the police may think necessary,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the record of the prints and impressions so taken shall be destroyed immediately following a decision not to institute criminal proceedings"</p></blockquote>
or under certain circumstances.

I think the whole Committee must have come to the conclusion both on the last Bill and on this one that there are now very few crimes which are detected as a result of print evidence, whether it is fingerprint, palmprint or any other print. Compared with the total number of crimes detected the percentage of crimes detected through print evidence is not nearly as significant as it once was. I accept that print evidence used to play a fairly major part in crime detection, but the new sophisticated methods of crime detection, now mean that older methods do not have the same significance. It is felt that there is a danger that the prints will not be destroyed. I can tell of my own experience, but not with police photographs, prints or anything like that. I once went to a well-known electrical warehouse to purchase an item for which I paid by cheque. I was asked to have my photograph taken holding up the cheque. I refused to have my photograph taken and I was given the assurance that provided the cheque did not bounce the photograph would not be developed. It was the Comet electrical warehouse. It was in my early days here
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
as an MP and I pursued the matter on the Floor of the House. It was discovered that there was a central agency in Soho in London which had half a million people's names and addresses, photographs, cheque book numbers all fed in through this process of photographing someone who paid for an item by cheque. The company involved took the photographs and they were fed into a central agency. Far from being destroyed the photographs were retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the cheque bounce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cheque did not bounce. I should tell the Solicitor-General that before he gets excited. I remember an incident in 1972~73 with the opening of the airport hotel at Heathrow where the then Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) was paired in a photograph with an unknown individual. It subsequently emerged that the photograph of the other person had been obtained from one of the central agencies which obtain these photographs from companies which photograph people if they pay by cheque. That is the kind of danger that prevails and causes deep concern. After the incident that I described with the Comet electrical warehouse I was invited by London Weekend Television to go to a shop in Oxford Street which was doing exactly the same thing and to take part in a confrontation with the manager. The significant thing was not the confrontation between the manager and myself, but the fear that the customers expressed about what was happening to the photographs once they were taken.

There is no guarantee that those palmprints, fingerprints and other such prints will be destroyed. Would it not be better—we put a sensible suggestion to the Committee—to wait until the police had taken a decision to charge a person before the fingerprint, palmprint or any other print operation was put into effect? I know that it is regular police procedure to fingerprint anyone charged. I can perfectly well understand that. We are saying here that someone who has been taken to the police station under clause 1(1) is to be fingerprinted, palmprinted and to have taken any other prints that the police may think necessary. I know that the Minister in reply may say that this will be a matter of discretion for the police and that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
will be a whole host of cases where the police will not use the power that they have been given in this subsection. But we all know, of course, that it will become a routine procedure that when a person is taken to a police station he is fingerprinted and palmprinted. The fear will exist there that the records will not be destroyed if the police decide not to charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point arises against the background of a debate that we had much earlier. It was related not to this Bill but to the circular that was sent to procurators fiscal concerning the recording of warnings against people whom the procurator fiscal considers he could prosecute but decides not to. These are people against whom he feels he might obtain a conviction. What happens when the police have decided to charge someone? The case is then sent to the procurator fiscal and the procurator fiscal decides that he does not want to take the case to court, but he is of the view that if he were to do so he could obtain a conviction. What happens to the fingerprints and the palmprints and any other prints in that case? Is only the warning recorded? Are the palmprints and the fingerprints retained, or are they destroyed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and, for the life of me, I do not see why it is necessary when someone has been taken to a police station under clause 1(1), to say to the police that they should take fingerprints and palmprints and all the rest at that stage. Why do the Government feel that this is necessary? Will the Minister say something about the change that has come over crime detection where fewer and fewer crimes are being detected through print detection procedures than hitherto. If an increasing number of offences is now detected as a result of the new procedures and a decreasing number is detected as a result of using print detection procedures, that lessens the case for this provision. There is now a very strong case for the Government to make a conciliatory move towards those people who have reservations. That would do the Government a great deal of good, I am not merely speaking for myself, I am speaking, as the Minister knows, as someone who supports the principle of clause 2. It would do the Government a great deal of good to be seen to remove a provision which will cause great concern and will heighten any doubts people already
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
have about the Bill. I hope the Minister will take the opportunity that our amendment provides him with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go over the same ground again. Broadly I agree with the case made by the Hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) who put forward a good argument. At that stage of detention it would be very offensive to a member of the public to have his fingerprints taken. I must confess that I was not aware that fingerprinting is no longer so important in the detection of crime. Apart from that, if a person has been detained under the Bill, taken along and had his fingerprints recorded, despite the caveat in the Bill that they would be destroyed at a later date if not required, the fear will always exist that this may not be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason amendment No. 33 is a kind of a fall-back position if the hon. Gentleman's amendment is not accepted by the Government as I hope that it will be. My amendment No. 33 asks for the insertion of the word "reasonably" before the words "consider appropriate" because this is a subjective decision by the constable of the circumstances in which he may take fingerprints. A policeman with that power will gaily take out the inking pad or whatever the mechanics are for fingerprinting and it will automatically follow in every case. He will be able to make that decision and that will be the end of it. The insertion of the word "reasonably" in amendment No. 33—which we shall not come to if amendment No. 23 is accepted—would produce an objective element so that the policeman will have to decide and may have to give account later that he had reasonable grounds in the circumstances of the case for demanding that fingerprints be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may have a Division on amendment No. 33 if he desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) began his remarks by asking why the Government have sought to introduce this particular proposal. He pointed out that it was not a feature of the last Government's Bill. It was however a specific recommendation of the Thomson report and one which we felt to be appropriate.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
For the convenience of the Committee I refer to page 15, paragraph 3.24 where it recommends that fingerprinting be permitted and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that the invasion of person involved in fingerprinting … is so slight as to be outweighed by the usefulness of the information provided by such a search".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman argued that fingerprinting was being used decreasingly as a means of solving crimes. I have no real evidence to suggest that that is the case. In any event, if it is the case, presumably we shall wish to use this power less often than we have in the past. The police are not required to fingerprint: it is a matter entirely for them in the circumstances of the case. While I have no reason to confirm the hon. Gentleman's remarks as to the usefulness of fingerprinting, that is a matter which the police will be able to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked the specific question about what would happen where, although the police thought that there was evidence, the procurator fiscal decided not to prosecute for various reasons. Of course in these circumstances the fingerprints would be destroyed because it is not the police who decide whether to institute criminal proceedings in Scotland but the procurator fiscal himself. Whatever views the police might have, the specific provision in the Bill is that the prints should be destroyed
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"immediately following a decision not to institute criminal proceedings against the person or on the conclusion of such proceedings".</p></blockquote>
Therefore there is no doubt that in the circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, if the procurator fiscal decided not to institute criminal proceedings for whatever reason, the prints would be required to be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main question which has been raised was on the benefits which fingerprinting might have, and the emphasis in the hon. Gentleman's remarks was on helping the police find the guilty man. Of course there is another purpose, equally important, which is to eliminate possible suspects at the earliest possible moment. If, for example, the police are aware that at the scene of the crime there are fingerprints and a suspect is brought into the police station, if they are able immediately to take his fingerprints they might very well find that the fingerprints are not the
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
same as those of the person for whom they are looking. Therefore they can immediately come to the view that the suspect is not entitled to be considered a suspect and should be released immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is obviously a very desirable objective but it is not one that is available to the police at the moment because, at the moment, unless the suspect voluntarily agrees to provide his fingerprints the police first have to arrest him, charge him with the offence and only then can they take his fingerprints and find that they are not the fingerprints of the suspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister really believe that if the police go to an incident and find someone at the scene of the incident and they take him to the police station and because his fingerprints do not tie up with the fingerprints that they find at the incident they are going to release him? Does the Minister really believe that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman assumes these powers will be used only when a person is found at the scene of an incident. That is only one set of circumstances. The police may have investigated, shall we say, a serious murder and fingerprints may have been found at the scene of the murder, or whatever crime it is—at a bank robbery or something of that kind—and they may subsequently, some days later, have reason to suspect a particular individual who is brought under these powers to the police station for questioning and for the use of the other powers. The police may be reasonably satisfied that if they can find who possesses the fingerprints that they have identified they will have caught the person responsible. If, however, the individual suspect is found to have different fingerprints the police may then be able to conclude that he could not have been responsible for the crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unusual, where a person has voluntarily agreed to give his fingerprints, that he is immediately eliminated from the list of suspects, whereas otherwise he might have been high on that list. But we have to accept the fact that, as the hon. Gentleman himself pointed out, individuals may not be willing to volunteer their fingerprints; even if they are innocent they may not be so willing, but, nevertheless, this might cause considerable problems in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
the prosecution of the case and in the accumulation of evidence. Therefore, I simply point out to the hon. Gentleman that the elimination of suspects at an early stage is a desirable objective and one that will be assisted by these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be saying that the fingerprints will be taken at the beginning of the questioning. What guarantee is there of that, and why should the police not take the fingerprints at the fifty-ninth minute of the fifth hour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct; they could so do. But the point I am making is that the main objective of the police inquiries is to establish a suspect, if they know that the person who committed the offence is the person whose fingerprints they have found at the scene of the crime. The police have no more desire than the hon. Gentleman to waste their time questioning a person who turns out to be completely innocent and unconnected with the offence, and if the police know that by immediately taking fingerprints they can either eliminate the suspect or confirm their suspicions as to his involvement, it is in their interest, as well as in the interest of everyone else, to do it right away. I accept that it will depend on the circumstances of each individual case at what stage in the inquiry the fingerprints are taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister can help me. He is constantly referring to fingerprints, but the actual sentence states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"fingerprints, palmprints and such other prints and impressions as the constable may, having regard to the circumstances of the suspected offence, consider appropriate".</p></blockquote>
I wonder if the Minister could indicate what is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other prints and impressions".</p></blockquote>
I can imagine footprints being taken, shoe impressions, but my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that this could also include buttock prints and I cannot understand under what circumstances they might be taken. There may be others. Could the Minister give us a clear indication of what he means by
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other prints and impressions"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
because that is an important aspect of this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has provided the hon. Member with that example he might like to direct his question to the hon. Member for Garscadden as to why he thought it an appropriate example to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may remember the famous case which arose under the unfair dismissal procedure in which a young lady had taken a photocopy of her buttocks and she got dismissed for it and there was a case about it. It might have been very important in that instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for once again assisting the Government in the presentation of the reasons for this important clause. I have been mentioning fingerprints up till now because the debate has concentrated on this aspect. However, the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is quite correct to point out that this particular provision goes beyond that. It covers, for example, teeth marks, which have occasionally been a very important method of identifying a suspect, or any part of the anatomy which might be considered appropriate to the circumstances of the particular offence which the police are investigating. I will not speculate at this stage as to the wide range of possible offences that might come under this category, that would depend obviously on the circumstances of the offence. I finally turn to the amendment of the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), amendment No. 33. He seeks to introduce the word "reasonably" after the word "offence" where it appears in clause 2. I think that it is a perfectly reasonable proposal—if I may use that word—that the power should be used when appropriate, given the qualification that the right hon. Gentleman seeks to add, and for the very reasons that he himself indicated I am happy to recommend to my hon. Friends and to the Committee that his amendment be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister has agreed very reasonably to accept the amendment of the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
because he is aware that the word "reasonably" does not make very much difference to his clause. There is nothing like a cosmetic gesture of good will to make things in the Committee that little bit sweeter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cynic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cynicism is a trait which is quite foreign to my character, as all my hon. Friends know. I am very grateful to the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) for indicating that he will support amendments No. 23 and No. 24, which is consequential upon it. They make, I think, a very real and important change in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great care to what the Minister said and I deliberately did not bounce up in this debate until I had heard what he had to say. In fact, although the amendment stands in my name as well as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), I came to this matter with a slightly open mind, and the amendment was a little in the nature of a probing amendment. I was not totally convinced that I would want to press the matter to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have not been in any way reassured by what has been said by the Minister. I think it is a matter of balance. It is quite clearly an invasion of privacy, an invasion of individual liberty, to have the right compulsorily to take fingerprints or other types of print at a stage where someone is not in fact being arrested but is merely being detained on suspicion. If we are to have compulsory detention at all, I suppose there is a case for saying that it ought to produce effective results. If I thought that in fact there would be a much more effective return on police effort I might be prepared to stifle my objections to this particular proposal on the ground that there is no point in refusing to swallow a gnat when I am being forced to swallow the camel of detention itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two objections. One is that I think—for reasons which I shall explain—that the clause will be ineffective in really helping the police, because I think that the number of occasions when it will improve the detection rate will be very limited. Also I believe that it is a significant invasion of the rights of the individual. We keep bandying Thomson
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
backwards and forwards, and I sometimes wish I had the self-denying ordinance of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who has to paraphrase rather than quote because of his sensitivity to the Thomson issue. In paragraph 3.24 there is an endorsement of the right to fingerprint. But later the paragraph says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But where any form of medical examination or search of body cavities or removal of any portion of the body, for example, hair, nail clippings, etc, is sought by the police they must obtain the consent of the detainee, and he must therefore have the opportunity of consulting a solicitor before deciding whether or not to consent."</p></blockquote>
What the Thomson Committee is saying is that it is prepared to wear, on balance, fingerprints, but that if we went further and said that the police would take anything that amounted to an examination of the cavities of the body that would be over the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a situation in the drafting of the Bill concerning
	<br><blockquote><p>"fingerprints, palmprints and such other prints and impressions as the constable may … consider appropriate".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has confirmed this, and it was laid down by Lord Mansfield in another place, that the Government are thinking of
	<br><blockquote><p>"teeth, feet, and the soles of shoes".—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 January 1980; Vol. 404, c. 748.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether an examination of teeth prints is an examination of the cavities of the body, and whether that is what Lord Thomson had in mind. He may have had other things in mind. For all that, it illustrates a shadowy grey area. If one says that Thomson is wrong in drawing the line at fingerprints, and that we should go on to any other sort of impression, then is it not reasonable to say that we should go on to take in nail clippings and hair clippings? That illustrates that we are probably better out of this area altogether, unless we can provide evidence that it will be a peculiarly helpful aid for the police in the course of their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman must concede that the Government's clause exactly mirrors Thomson's own recommendations, that prints are acceptable at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
this stage, but that the removal of hair clippings, nail clippings and so forth—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are parts of the body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon and learned Friend says, they are parts of the body, and this should be done only in the circumstances that Thomson himself recommended. The Government are not trying to go beyond the Thomson recommendations in this sphere. I hope that the hon Gentleman will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. They are going a little further in spirit, but we may be under pressure to push the line out even farther in the not too distant future. My preference would be not to go into this grey area at all, and to leave the law in this matter as it stands, where consent would be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Thomson report refers only to fingerprints and does not go into the other nuances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. The right hon Member has a fair point, which illustrates the difficulty which I am sure that the Under-Secretary is interpreting honestly—but possibly mistakenly—in the spirit of paragraph 3.24. I think that the right hon Member has the better of the argument. The fact that two hon Gentlemen can dispute in this way, Mr. Gourlay, makes my point. We are in an area where definition is difficult, where boundaries are difficult to draw, and we should be better to withdraw from it to our present traditional standing, where consent and the voluntary principle—not bad Conservative principles, I may say—rule on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusive argument is whether, given that this is an invasion and an encroachment on private individual rights, it will greatly strengthen the hand of the police? If it did, we should have seriously to consider whether this were something on which we should give way. I do not think that it is. I have listened with interest to the Under-Secretary's ingenious argument about helping the innocent. I am not sure that it is of much practical importance, but the main reason why people refuse to be fingerprinted is that they fear that they may be shown to
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
be guilty. If he is right in saying that the innocence of someone held by the police in a police station can be established by fingerprinting, it is extremely unlikely that we should need compulsory powers in order to get that fingerprint taken. I imagine that the person would be only too willing to co-operate. If I am in a police station facing six hours of questioning, and I am told that at the scene of the murder last Thursday in Glasgow the police found a fingerprint, which they would like to compare with mine, and I know that on that Thursday I was at my auntie's in Aberdeen, I would not need to be compelled to give mine. The Under-Secretary's argument about helping the innocent is something of a non-starter, therefore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we eliminate that argument, the number of times in which detection was aided seem very small. We are then presupposing that we have a print at the locus, and we have a suspect, and we need to get his prints for comparison purposes to prove that he is the man—clearly that arises only if there are no SCRO records against his name. If there is a Scottish Criminal Records Office file it will include fingerprints, they will be able to make the comparison on that basis, and that will confirm whether they have the right man. When they know they have the right man they can arrest him, and get the comparison with their prints for production in court very simply under the present law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the vast majority of cases in which fingerprinting is likely to arise, in the day-to-day matter of housebreaking cases, we do not need these compulsory powers in terms of detection, because our own SCRO records will supply the want. We are reduced to a very small number of cases in which the suspect is a first offender and there is no Scottish Criminal Records Office identification procedure open to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have to decide is whether, in that small number of cases, there is sufficient merit in giving the police compulsory powers—given that in many cases they will be able to get the fingerprints on the basis of co-operation or after the gentleman concerned has had the advice of his lawyer. In my experience, lawyers always advise a suspect to co-operate, on the ground that otherwise he is likely to be arrested, and warrants for fingerprinting will be obtained from the sheriff. In terms of detection, we are knocking at an open
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
door and, if I may mix the metaphor, a pretty small door in terms of police identification potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better not to infringe an individual's liberty for such a flimsy argument in terms of police effectiveness. What worries people like me and many others involved in this is that the power would become routine. Everyone brought in on a clause 2 detention would be automatically fingerprinted by the police, not because it was one of the small number of cases in which it was necessary to establish the identification of the offender or to discover that the suspect was not going to become an accused party, but because it would be done automatically so that they had his "dabs" for a future occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Under-Secretary to say disingenuously that the procurator fiscal would order the destruction of the prints if no proceedings were taken. No doubt one copy would go to the procurator fiscal, but, in the nature of things, no doubt one copy would remain with the police. There is no way of guaranteeing that that copy would be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a serious accusation. He will appreciate that the Bill will make it a statutory requirement that any such impressions should be destroyed. Is he seriously suggesting that the police would deliberately flout the specific requirement of an Act of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am suggesting is that we should live in the world of reality. The Minister has made a serious allegation. Let us not over-dramatise it. It is a realistic assessment of what is likely to happen. The police, as we all know, have their own working practices. No doubt in many cases it is done with the best of intentions—to equip them with the widest possible range of information about their "patch" and the people on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will not come as a surprise to the Solicitor-General. Lord Mansfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In almost any police activity, if the police wish to cheat, break the rules or break the law, they can and will do so, and we must face that."—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 January 1980; Vol.404, c.748.]</p></blockquote>
We must face that. Lord Mansfield, in reacting to the problem and admitting that this may occur and that we must face it, has shown a deal more realism than have
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
the somewhat mock cries of horror from the Under-Secretary. He has worked in conjunction with the criminal courts for a good part of his life and he must know the reality of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he thinks that this is the voice of the Glasgow Bar Association, coming hysterically from Ingram Street, Glasgow, perhaps he would like to look at the speech of Lord McCluskey in the same debate. He spoke at some length about what he described as "gossip" or "intelligence" files. He pointed out that they are well known to be kept by the police for their private information. Lord McCluskey, an ex-Solicitor-General with great experience of this, said that there was a real danger that copies of the prints would be preserved as working notes—if I may put it that way. It does not matter how carefully the shredding machine in the procurator fiscal's office is operated or how carefully the prints of someone who has not been charged are weeded out. I suspect that that is shutting the door after the horse has bolted in terms of what may have happened at an earlier stage of police procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance the procedure will not help much in terms of identifying an offender. I think that it will become routine and will therefore become offensive to public opinion and individual liberty. I believe that it is impossible in reality to build in adequate safeguards. On these grounds I would prefer to see it out of the Bill, and I hope that my hon. Friend will consider pushing this to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was less than generous to himself when he replied to my earlier remarks. I can just imagine the briefing meeting this morning before the Minister came to the Committee when his officials were telling him that he was on a sticky wicket here and that the best way out was to accept the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart). What I had expected the Minister to say—I am deeply disappointed that he did not—was that the provisions in this part of the Bill, which we want removed would assist the police in crime detection, that if they were left in the Bill the rate of crime detection would increase as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not say that. He said that these powers, if left in the Bill, could—I noted the words carefully—help to eliminate innocent people at the beginning of an investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that that was the only reason the powers were in the Bill. I said that that was one of their effects. Of course, the assisting in accumulating evidence when the suspect is involved in the crime will be of great assistance to the police and will enable them to bring a charge earlier than they might otherwise be able to do. I was adding the additional reason which had not been referred to during the earlier contributions to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help noticing that the Minister is still avoiding saying that these Draconian measures, if left in the Bill, will improve the crime detection rate. He knows perfectly well that these measures will not improve the crime detection rate by one half of 1 per cent. They will do little or nothing to improve the crime detection rate, and the Minister knows that perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us bear in mind that in serious crime the detection rate is very high—well up into 90 per cent, of all serious crime. It is when one gets down to housebreaking and that kind of crime that the figures begin to drop, and even more so where vandalism is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the failure to get good crime detection rates is that people will not report the incidents, or someone who has seen the incident will not testify to the fact that so-and-so was the culprit. It is nothing to do with fingerprinting, palmprinting or the ability to detain or release someone. It has everthing to do with the police's inability—I do not use "inability" in a derogatory or critical sense to get substantiation of the fact that so-and-so was the villain of the piece when the offence was committed. The Minister knows that perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the Committee should be hidebound in accepting every word, dot and comma that Thomson said and incorporating that in legislation</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend agrees with me. But the Minister ought to have argued that the inclusion of these powers would increase the crime detection rate. It is the whole basis of this Bill that the guilty person will be convicted—we are all in favour of that—and the innocent person will be much freer to walk the streets. That is not what the Minister said when he replied to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
A debate that started off on a probing basis, on the basis of finding out the Government's thinking behind inclusion in this Bill of something that was not in the Labour Government's Bill, has escalated into a debate on a major and serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Western Isles pointed out, Thomson did not suggest that there should be an ability to palmprint and take other prints. Thomson spoke only about the need to fingerprint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree, but if we come to the conclusion that the ability to take fingerprints, palmprints and other prints will not increase the crime detection rate—I notice that the Minister has not made that claim for it—why on earth is the provision there? It will not increase the crime detection rate. It will be a serious intrusion into people's personal liberty, and it ought not to be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought not to look at this purely from the point of view of a Minister who gets so many marks from the Prime Minister if he gets his Bill through intact, and loses so many for every amendment on which he is defeated or which he has to accept. He ought not to look at the provision in this way, nor ought he to look at it simply from a lawyer's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought to take the opportunity we are giving him to consider our amendment from the point of view of balancing the rights of the individual with the rights and powers of the police. He ought to take the opportunity that we are giving him to try to allay some of the fears that many people have about this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in Ruth Wishart's report of the Scottish Tory Party conference at the weekend, where she described the debate on law and order. The resolution was framed in such a way that those who were in favour and those who were against could make the same speeches. I thought that that summed up the Tory Party's attitude to law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a golden opportunity for the Government to make a gesture to those people who have serious reservations about this Bill by taking this proposal out, because there is no good reason for its being in. The Minister, despite his attempts, and despite his ability, which I readily recognise, has not been able to assure the Committee of any sound reasons why this is in the Bill at all.

Against the background of that failure, I strongly advise my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Western Isles, whose amendment has been accepted to vote for amendment Number 23. I offer the right hon. Gentleman my sincere congratulations that after seven sittings one amendment has been accepted, though I enter the caveat that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before this amendment is put to the vote perhaps I should explain that my enthusiasm for it ought not to be seen in the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, Central (Mr. McCartney) and I have agreed to release two Conservative members of the Committee from the detention of the Committee this morning, and therefore our votes will not be recorded in the Division. These are favours that we disperse liberally to Conservative hon. Members. I conclude by again asking my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Western Isles to vote for amendment No. 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I persuaded myself that I should contribute to the debate this morning because of the somewhat unimpressive statement by the Under-Secretary. It is disappointing that he does not see the arguments that we have been bringing forward throughout the Committee proceedings, particularly the arguments of those of us who are determined in our opposition to the provisions relating to detention. As we work our way through the Bill, and examine the powers available to the police, many of us are worried about the amount of harassment that builds up if a person is detained for questioning at a police station. That is why I feel that we should discuss this provision just a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Under-Secretary to give an assurance about the power in the Bill to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take fingerprints, palmprints and such other prints and impressions as the constable may, having regard to the circumstances of the suspected offence, consider appropriate".</p></blockquote>
When I asked him to give an assurance that the power in the Bill—or the Act when it became a law—would not be abused by the police I was not given that</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>assurance. Throughout the arguments about detention we have said that there could be abuse and that the police could use it as a form of punishment. Therefore, the taking of the prints, which the Under-Secretary said would be done straight away so that the person who was suspected, if found not to be the person the police were looking for a suspect, could be immediately released would not all happen in the space of 10 minutes. Indeed, the individual could find himself in the situation of having these prints taken at the fifty-ninth minute of the fifth hour and that is improper; there is no safeguard and I find that extremely worrying.</p>
	<p>The argument that the police would not wish to waste their time is one that I would subscribe to. I would like to be persuaded of that, but I do not think that that would be the case and I fear—and my fear has been repeated several times on the whole issue of detention—that there will be abuse and that there are serious dangers in this regard.</p>
	<p>I agree with those who feel that this is a loss of freedom without any parallel of effectiveness. I do not see that the police are going to be more effective if they have this provision and if that is the case that is not a price I would want to pay for the loss of freedom to the individual. The argument that in some way this Bill represents the Thomson Committee recommendation on fingerprinting has not been substantiated and is open-ended and leaves the possibility that there would be many other prints and impressions taken. That is made quite clear in paragraph (	<i>c</i>).</p>
	<p>That being so, I am satisfied with the points made by my hon. Friends the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to tell the Committee that it is not now the intention of the Government to proceed with the clause because they have patently lost the argument.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 33, in page 3, line 41, after "offence", insert "reasonably".—[	<i>Mr. Donald Stewart.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 10, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"and there shall be recorded the time when he was so informed, the identity of the constable informing him, the terms in which he is informed and his response, if any, thereto and he shall be invited to sign the record".</p></blockquote>
This is a self-evident amendment. It can be read for its plain, everyday, lower English meaning and the case for it is also fairly plain and straightforward. The Committee will remember that subsection (7) says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person detained under subsection (1) above shall be under no obligation to answer any question other to give his name and address, and a constable shall so inform him".</p></blockquote>
I am proposing that we shall add, to that the words in the amendment. It is clear that there should be no possibility of ambiguity that the safeguards which the Government have included—we think that they are inadequate—in the Bill as drafted should be carried out to the letter. One of the safeguards which we regard as of particular importance is the specific informing of a person detained under clause 2 that he is under no obligation to answer questions which may be put to him other than giving his name and address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is of such fundamental importance that I believe that the fact that the caution or semi-caution has been given should be recorded along with the other matters which are referred to in subsection (4) and that the name of the constable concerned should also be given so that there is no doubt, if there is dispute as to whether the caution has been properly administered in a subsequent trial, as to exactly what happened. It is a safeguard for the police more than for the suspected person because it will make disputes about whether the police acted properly harder to maintain and it will act also as an aide memoire to the police constable in making sure that there is no slip up on the part of the police which allows a technical loophole to emerge in what might otherwise be a good Crown case. I hope that the amendment will find favour with the Under-Secretary. It seems to me to make good sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Half of the hon. Gentleman's amendment finds so much favour with the Government that they have already included it in the Bill. I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 2(4)(	<i>d</i>) on page 3 which specifically provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the time when the person is informed of his rights in terms of subsection (7) below and the identity of the constable so informing him"</p></blockquote>
have actually to be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for as the remaining parts of the amendment concerning the terms in which the person is informed and his response, there is a statutory obligation that he should be informed of these rights. It does not seem to the Government that one adds anything by simply recording the fact. The police have that obligation. I do not see that the person's response is terribly relevant. The important thing is the time in which he was informed of these rights and the identity of the constable who has so informed him. If there is any dispute, the identity of the police officer will be known and he can be called on to give evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since a substantial part of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is already in the Bill, I hope he will feel reassured that his objective is shared by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sweet reason and light prevail.

We come next to amendments Nos. 139, 87, and 140 with which it is proposed to discuss new clauses 2 and 4.

The other is the totally different principle that the Bill should apply for five years and then be suspended.
