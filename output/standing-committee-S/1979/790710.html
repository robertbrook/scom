	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Bail etc (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>The Solicitor-General for Scotland.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. We are about to move into debate on clause 1, a very important clause. On Second Reading the Solicitor-General for Scotland, when making various observations, indicated to the Committee that it was his intention to issue guidance to procurators fiscal and instructions to the police. We asked at that time whether that guidance and those instructions could be made available to the Committee in time for the Committee proceedings. I am not sure, but as far as I am aware, neither the guidance nor the instructions have been made available. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General for Scotland would indicate whether these documents are to be made available, because they are very important to the subject we are about to discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is proceeding with consideration of the Bill and the matter raised is not a subject for the Chair. The Solicitor-General for Scotland may wish to comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not have been appropriate to detail guidance for the implementation of a clause which had not yet been considered or passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. That is a very clever point to make, but we are dealing not with a frivolous matter but with a very serious matter. It is within that guidance that this clause must be discussed. Unless the Committee has an indication of what that guidance contains, it would in my view—I submit this respectfully—be very difficult for us to come to a conclusion about this aspect of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's observations may be correct in his view,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
but I am afraid that the Committee has to proceed with the Bill in accordance with the amendments which have been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>RELEASE ON CONDITIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 9, leave out from beginning to "shal" in line 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the same time it may be convenient for the Committee to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 4, in page 2, line 8, leave out subsection (3).</p>
	<p>No. 7, in page 2, line 22, leave out from "conditions" to end of line 23.</p>
	<p>No. 8, in page 2, line 24, leave out "or finding sufficient bail".</p>
	<p>No. 9, in page 2, line 26, leave out from "imposed" to end of line 27.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 4, which I see as the main amendment in this group of amendments. Amendment No. 4 seeks to leave out subsection (3), which deals with the continuing practice of retaining money as a condition of release on bail. This matter formed a fairly substantial part of our debate on Second Reading and during the Committee proceedings of the previous Government's Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. It is an extremely important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the researches I have been able to do since Second Reading, I have ascertained that there is only one group of people in Scotland which appears to be in favour of the retention of money as a condition of release on bail. That group appears to be the judges. I have made inquiries. My views on the previous Government's Bill have been confirmed. Neither the sheriffs nor the police are in favour of the retention of money as a condition of release on bail. I have found little opinion in favour of the retention of money as a condition of release on bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to avoid going over the old arguments that we had on the previous Bill. The argument appears to be that there are certain offences—mainly fraud, corruption, embezzlement and so on—where it is considered that the retention of money as a condition of release on bail would serve as a deterrent to the possibility of the accused person not appearing for the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is important to understand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the setting in which bail is, or is not, granted. In the first place, bail certainly is not granted in the High Court. Bail is granted at sheriff court level. When an accused person appears before the sheriff and his solicitor asks for bail, it would appear now that the procurator fiscal will be under guidance—I shall not use the word "instruction"—from the Solicitor-General for Scotland to consider what kind of offence the person is accused of before asking the sheriff to consider imposing, as one of the conditions of release, the deposit of a substantial sum of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I raised the point of order at the beginning of the debate. Unless we know precisely what kind of cases will be treated in this way by procurators fiscal, this Committee can only come to a decision on the matter in complete ignorance of the facts. I am astonished that the Solicitor-General for Scotland should suggest that the guidance should be made up only after the Committee has come to its decision. I should have thought that some kind of guidance could have been presented to the Committee this morning, at least for discussion. That has not been done. We are expected to take a decision on this important matter, while the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland keep to themselves the question of the guidance that will be issued to procurators fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the question of the effectiveness of money as a condition of release. In the Committee that considered the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, I mentioned the fact that of those people who were offered bail on money, 27 per cent. were remanded or retained in custody because they could not find the money. At that time the present Solicitor-General for Scotland was leading for the Opposition. He asked me what happened to the 27 per cent. after they had appealed against the imposition of such a substantial sum of money in the form of bail. I openly admitted that I was not sure by how much the number was reduced or whether it remained steady following appeals. But the significant argument in favour of retaining money bail is that the person is more likely to turn up at his or her trial. The argument against retaining money bail is that far too many people were being retained in custody simply because the substantial amount of money that was being imposed as a condition of release could not be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The danger that we are moving into is that if money bail is to be retained as one of the conditions of release, basically, nothing will change, because, despite the guidance given to procurators fiscal, it is not they who will decide whether the money is made a condition of release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procurator fiscal can plead in breach to the sheriff until he is blue, red yellow, green or whatever in the face, but it will not make a blind bit of difference to the sheriff. If the sheriff decides to impose money bail as a condition of release, the sheriff will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we shall see is a continuation of the present practice whereby money bail is used extensively as a condition of release, and to the money bail will be added the other conditions that we thought should stand alone and which we still consider should stand alone as a condition of release on bail. I refer to the surrender of an accused's passport, reporting to the police station, say, every afternoon, and making sure that the police are aware if the accused person changes his address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Solicitor-General for Scotland should understand that he can issue what guidance he likes to procurators fiscal, but if the sheriff decides to ignore that guidance, there is nothing that he can do about it, there is nothing that procurators fiscal can do about it, and there is even less that the accused person can do about it. I see that as a very serious situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we had an exchange of views on Second Reading about the instructions—as the Solicitor-General for Scotland put it—that the hon. and learned Gentleman intended to issue to chief constables. I explained to him—he was not prepared to accept the explanation—that no Government had any power to issue instructions to chief constables. The Solicitor-General for Scotland, in response to my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, quickly called in aid the the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, saying that Lords Advocate did have the right to issue instructions to chief constables on the matter. I tell the Solicitor-General for Scotland that he is still wrong. Section 9 of the 1975 Act does not deal with the question whether police should release persons who are accused of an offence. It has nothing to do with the release conditions that chief constables should consider when persons are accused of an offence. The Solicitor-General for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Scotland quoted only part of section 9. That is the trouble with Ministers. I used to do it myself. One quotes only part in the hope that one will not be found out. But the Solicitor-General for Scotland has been found out. The part he quoted was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Advocate may from time to time issue instructions to a chief constable with regard to the reporting, for consideration of the question of prosecution,"</p></blockquote>
There the Solicitor-General for Scotland stopped. But there is more. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of offences alleged to have been committed within the area of such chief constable, and it shall be the duty of a chief constable to whom any such instruction is issued to secure compliance therewith."</p></blockquote>
That has nothing to do with the question whether a person should be released or held in custody—the decision that the officer in charge of the police station has to make, almost at a minute's notice, as to whether the person should be released or held. But it has everything to do with the conditions under which the offence should be reported—reported, no doubt, to the procurator fiscal, for whom the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Lord Advocate are responsible—and it has nothing to do with the situation we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. We are, I understand, dealing with clause 1 and amendment No. 4, relating to money bail. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is talking about a matter which arises under clauses 8 and 9. In order to make progress, perhaps we could get back to the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, I think it is fair to say that, in my opinion subsection (3) covers the majority of the argument which has been adduced so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Gourlay. My argument is that money bail would not be an effective deterrent to stop an accused person from absconding and not turning up at his trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I go through my argument, I know that most understanding members of the Committee—those who will not follow the path of blind loyalty to a Government who intend to retain something that is not only outdated but relates more to the Victorian ages than the twentieth century—will understand that this will probably be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
only opportunity that we shall have for the remainder of this century to update the conditions on which accused persons are released following their appearance before a sheriff charged with any sort of serious offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must, with respect, refer to the mid-wives of the suggestion in the Bill that money bail should be retained. The mid-wives, of course, were the judges. I remember the Solicitor-General for Scotland reading out that letter at great length. Many of my hon. Friends and right honourable Members on the Conservative Benches have great legal experience and they know better than I that unless one makes judges change their minds, unless one changes the system for them, the last thing which they are inclined to do is to change the system. They do not want the system changed and it is our job, with the responsibilities which we have as Members of Parliament, to change it responsibly, to make it more fitted for the twentieth century and to take it out of the Victorian ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever decision the Committee may come to on the amendment, I say in all honesty that if money bail is retained as a condition of bail we shall have made no progress at all and the Second Reading time that we took on the Bill and the Committee time that we take over the next five or six weeks on it will be time which has been absolutely wasted, because it will have achieved no purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said will have persuaded the Committee that we should impose our will on the Government, as was done from time to time when the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill was before the Committee. The Committee always has the great good fortune to be made up of a mixture of lawyers and those of us who bring common-sense to these matters. I hope that the common-sense view will prevail and that at the end of the debate the Government will see the wisdom of the argument and not proceed with the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of
those who fall within the former category mentioned in the closing words of the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), I hope, nevertheless, that I shall be able to bring some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
common-sense to the debate on the amendment.

I have listened with great interest to what I know to be a very impassioned declaration in favour of totally removing money bail, and I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth pointing out that only one group of people supported the retention of money bail in any form. However, I suggest to the Committee that it is not a question of pressure groups. We are dealing with a law which is either to work or is not to work. It is not a question of who is for or against it, but one of whether the particular subsection fulfils a purpose. I suggest to the Committee that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept a lot of the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth in relation to money bail as it has been used in the past, but I draw to the attention of the hon. Gentlemen and the Committee what, to me, are the essential words in the subsection. Those words appear in line 13 of subsection (3)—"special circumstances". So far as I understand it, what subsection (3) tries to do is to recognise that there are certain instances where the other conditions of bail would not apply satisfactorily and that, in effect, those conditions would be " special circumstances" which would allow sheriffs to impose money bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, mention was made of the question of fishing boats transgressing the fishing laws of our country. I suggest that this is a very important example where the sort of conditions of handing over passports, giving addresses and being within the general view of the police at all times would not apply unless one were, in effect, to impound the boat, to hold working fishermen for perhaps as much as three or four months while awaiting trial, and that those conditions would be inappropriate in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that those are the sort of special circumstances to which the subsection is directed. Another circumstance that could arise is where there might have been a company fraud, where the principals of the company, who would become the accused, happen to live abroad and carry on their business abroad, and where, again, it would be impracticable to hold them in this country, to remove their passports and so on. Again, in such
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
an example, these would be special circumstances that would warrant the sheriff imposing money bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In brief, therefore, while accepting that there are dangers, I would hope to hear from my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland that those special circumstances are the sort of special circumstances to which we are referring. If that be so, I believe that in the interests of having a complete system-—not one that will allow the rich criminal to escape the conditions of bail—subsection (3) should remain part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was touched to hear with what a warm glow of nostalgia my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) recalled rebellions on the then Government Benches on the Committee considering the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. It is extremely encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought not, perhaps, to spend too much time in rehashing arguments here, as we did not have them on Second Reading. But as my hon. Friend said, we have all had the opportunity of looking again at the matter and considering where the balance of convenience lies. I can see that it is a balance of convenience. There are dangers on whichever side of the argument we end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that I should explain briefly why subsection (3) should be excised. The other amendments that we are taking with the group are consequential upon it and depend upon the fate of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) will receive the assurance that he wants from the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I would be amazed if he did not. He also knows, for reasons which I shall come to, that that assurance is probably not worth the paper it will ultimately be written upon in 	<i>Hansard.</i> That is not an attack upon the integrity of the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who I believe, in this case, has impeccably liberal sentiments in the matter. I am sure that he intends that money bail shall be retained only for special circumstances, and that those circumstances shall be very tightly controlled, and shall refer to the small, narrow and specialist cases, of the type to which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
But the trouble, of course, is that the Solicitor-General for Scotland, however eloquent and persuasive, cannot control the situation. The sheriff is the master in his own court and if the power is open to that sheriff, he, the sheriff, is in a position to use or abuse that power. There is nothing that the Committee can do in terms of exhortation, of guidance, of persuasion, or of admirable liberal sentiments, totally to guard against that danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is worth running that risk and retaining money bail for the very small number of cases that in any given year are likely to fall into the narrow and carefully-drawn categories of which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has spoken. I have not done the research—it may be that the Solicitor-General for Scotland can help us—but the number of big company frauds that take place in Scotland, and which might be thought suitable for a heavy monetary bail order, must be small indeed. The number can be counted on one hand. Maybe only once in two or three years such a case would come up. I can think of only a couple in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, on fisheries, I am not convinced that there are no other ways in terms of conditions or expedited trials—and it is normally an expedited trial for the reasons given by my hon. Friend—by which we cannot get round the difficulty. We are now providing statutory authority for conditions. In the past, conditions for bail could not be used, I understand, with any certainty of success because if, having agreed to report to a police station at 7 p.m. every Saturday, one said "Goodbye, I am not going to do it", as long as one turned up for the trial, one was all right. There was the case of Greene v. H.M.A. in 1976, with which the Solicitor-General for Scotland will be familiar. One might say that it was a bond of honour between the sheriff and the accused if conditions were set. But now we have statutory authority and if those conditions are breached, it is a separate criminal offence with very heavy penalties, which we shall be discussing later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a complete change of situation. By and large, in the vast majority of cases, I believe that bail conditions can be made effective without recourse to money bail. Therefore, the number of cases where courts may feel that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
are handicapped or embarrassed because they cannot impose money bail is tiny. In the totality of the Scottish criminal system, statistically, socially and legally they are insignificant. I do not believe that we should retain money bail merely for this tiny group of exceptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger, on the other hand—and it seems to me to be a much more real and larger danger—is that when in years to come the Solicitor-General for Scotland looks back at his handiwork, he will be genuinely embarrassed to discover that money bail is being abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one gives guidance, one is giving it to procurators fiscal. One can say to procurators fiscal "You will only oppose bail in certain narrow circumstances". Perhaps procurators fiscal—although I am, perhaps, not as confident as the hon. and learned Member—will follow those instructions. But there is no reason why a sheriff 	<i>ex proprio motu</i> cannot say "Perhaps the fiscal is not objecting to bail but I certainly object to bail and I shall impose money bail in a very considerable sum. I am allowed to do so because I have an open discretion as subsection (3) of this Act still remains."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen examples of this when working in the Glasgow sheriff court. It happened to me only a month or two ago. A Glasgow sheriff insisted on setting a very high figure for bail in a case in which I was appearing, although during discussion with the fiscal I had agreed that there would not be bail and that the person would be ordained. I make no objection to that. It was not improper. That was a discretion open to that sheriff—and no doubt he probably would have doubled the bail sum had he known that I had done a deal behind his back with the fiscal. I use that example to illustrate that giving instructions to fiscals is absolutely worthless if one leaves unfettered discretion to the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the views of the Solicitor-General for Scotland on this and in general terms I am sure that he will sympathise with this view. An eccentric bailie in the district court, someone idiosyncratic in the extreme, may say " The procurator fiscal can have all the guidance that the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General for Scotland can provide, but, at the end of the day, I do not like glue-sniffing cases, nor do I like drunk and disorderlies, and if this man has the cheek to say that he is not guilty, we shall set bail at £50, and if he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
does not have it he can go to Barlinnie and it serves him jolly well right. He is guilty, is he not?—otherwise he would not be here."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no way that one can stop a bailie doing that, however worlds removed it may be from the special circumstances of which advocates, in their rarefied atmosphere, are thinking. That option will be open to bailies so long as subsection (3) remains on the statute book. That seems to be a very much bigger danger to the whole legal system that the tiny handful of highly specialist cases in which, arguably, it may be more useful to have the additional option, apart from conditions, of money bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall later be debating a new clause which gives a right to bail. At present we do not have a right to bail in the Scottish courts. It is not explicitly stated as it is in section 4 of the Bail Act 1976 in England. That might give reassurance because it would encourage sheriffs at the end of the day, if there was no objection, to recognise that they had to grant bail. But we do not even give that negative encouragement to sheriffs to heed the advice that has been given to procurators fiscal but inevitably not to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance of convenience and on looking at the competing dangers, I do not think that there is any argument here. I am not so black and white as to say that there is nothing in the argument about the small specialist cases of big embezzlement, company fraud and so on. Of course there is something in that argument. But in the real world, measured against the dangers of abuse and common use in the district and sheriff courts up and down Scotland, of idiosyncratic judges saying "To hell with this. We go our own way. We shall impose money bail", it seems much safer to secure the intention of this reform. It must be the intention of the Government Front Bench to remove subsection (3) and, therefore, to remove temptation—I am sure the Solicitor-General for Scotland is against temptation in all forms—from the lower courts to abuse the intent of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.00 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise as a member of the solicitors' branch of the profession, which is renowned for its common sense. When the parent version of this Bill first came before Parliament, in the form of a criminal justice Bill, I had one or two reservations about the exclusion of any
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
kind of money bail. On consideration over a period of months, I think it was right for the then Government to have excised completely any kind of reservation about money bail. The reason is that I suspect that some of the judges in the sheriff court and the lay magistrates referred to by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), would succumb to the temptation to use money bail. From that basis of a few cases, if they got away with it, a broader path would be beaten out by subsequent members of the judiciary or by the magistrates, restoring a provision which some of them feel should never have been abolished in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have had a bit more confidence if the money bail reservation had been restricted to the High Court of Justiciary, but when it has been left open to the sheriff courts or district courts, I have severe reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term deployed in subsection (3) refers to what
	<br><blockquote><p>"is appropriate to the special circumstances of the case."</p></blockquote>
I assure the Committee that there will be many sheriffs and lay magistrates who would find it very easy to secure some justification under the "special circumstances". They would ensure that money bail would be the best way of securing the attendance of a particular person in court. They would use it in ways in which the Solicitor-General for Scotland had not envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving licence to the courts to use money bail. It will be limited, we are told, by instructions that will be given to procurators fiscal by the Lord Advocate's Department. They are instructions that we shall not see. Subsequently the police, under another part of the Bill, will also be given guidance from the Scottish Office. There is a hint—although I do not think it has yet been expressed—that the judges might give some guidance to sheriffs and lay magistrates about how this provision should be used. In other words, we are issuing a licence for the use of money bail, but we have no idea whatsoever about the conditions under which it will be deployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden mentioned that the judges, sheriffs or lay magistrates may ignore the guidance which they receive from on high. That is possible. But it is very difficult for members of this Committee to give permission for something which may be open to abuse, without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
knowing what the guidelines are intended to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal breifly with two of the points that have been raised. The first instance where money bail may be deployed is in regard to fisheries cases. I understand that the sheriff courts which normally deal with such cases are not as busy as some of the other courts in industrial areas and they tend to give priority to dealing with foreign boats which have been caught fishing illegally in Scottish waters. In those circumstances the matter can be taken care of by the courts proceeding very swiftly with the trial. If there were an objection by the skipper concerned or his agents about the time required for presentation of the case, it would be for the sheriff to obtain appropriate assurances that the skipper would be available for trial. Whether those assurances were given through the embassy or the consulate concerned does not really matter. However, they would have to provide suitable assurances, which the sheriff could accept. If one skipper thereafter broke the assurances, no doubt the sheriff at, say Lanarkshire sheriff court would look upon future applications for bail in a much stricter light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second way of dealing with the matter, of course, is to impound the boat. Indeed, that might be a very useful way of stepping up some of the provisions against illegal fishing in our legislation, although that is not the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second specific example which was adduced by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was that, in effect, special privileges should be given by statute to those tax dodgers who are living abroad, or company fraudsters, and so on. In my view, those people should be treated in exactly the same fashion as other citizens of the country. It would be up to them to provide suitable conditions or assurances under which they would be released. I do not think that the special grounds and privileges that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems to me that if this provision on bail is abused, some of the cost savings that are mentioned in the preface to the Bill would also not materialise. For those reasons, I wish to add my voice to those who are opposed to the retention of money bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been somewhat intrigued by the categories that Opposition Members have seen fit to attack in supporting the amendment. It seems to be that, on the one hand, there are judges who have spent their entire lives studying the law; on the other hand, there are bailies and magistrates who, regrettably, have never done any such thing. I should like to suggest that we do not simply look at the matter as though monetary bail is, in some way, totally evil of its own sake. I can envisage circumstances where it would be of benefit both to the accused and to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the examples given by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). The question of providing finance as a condition of bail for someone involved in a fraudulent enterprise could well be the most reasonable way of dealing with the problem. It might be far more inconvenient and far more of an imposition to such a man, still with a presumption of innocence over his head, simply to deposit a sum of money, than for there to be some other condition, such as his having to report to a police station in a particular sheriffdom once a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is that of course there are bad examples—and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has as much experience as anyone of the matter—of magistrates who have not applied the law fairly. However, not one Opposition Member has referred to the fact that there are appeal procedures. The only assurance that I should like from my hon. and learned Friend is that the legislation in no way will seek to alter the rights of the Crown or the accused in any appeal procedures that exist at present and which, I trust, will still be open after the passing of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Mackay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not meant to take part in this debate until I discovered a third category of individual, of which I am one. I discovered that there are lawyers, who have legal sense, and there are the rest of us, who have common-sense. From the contributions of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I learned that there are lay magistrates who are maverick and idiosyncratic, and so on. I have to admit that I fall into that category—not of being maverick or idiosyncratic, but, through
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
my having been a lay magistrate a justice of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that there is a balance of argument about the clause and about the whole question of retention of money bail. I just want to keep the Committee for a minute or two, to point out to Opposition Members that nowadays justices of the peace have to go on training courses. I can speak for only the training courses that take place in the Argyll and Bute district, but I assure the Committee that those training courses give the justices considerable guidance on their duties. As those training courses take place in other parts of Scotland as well, I am sure that the justices will be told exactly what is meant by the retention of money bail in the Bill. I am quite sure that any maverick among them will be ironed out after these courses and that they will apply the law as we mean it to be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say that the great majority, if not all, of the cases that come before a district court are cases in which money bail should not be applied. I have considerable confidence that those training courses for justices of the peace will enable us to go ahead with certainty that the JPs will do their duty and will not continue the use of money bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this debate has done anything, it has given us an insight into the attitude that some people have to all members of their profession except themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money bail is abolished in the Bill, but there is retained the possibility that a deposit of money may be a condition in special circumstances, otherwise it is not lawful. That is the emphasis on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the paranoia which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has about money bail. As far as I know, it is not mentioned in the Ten Commandments. It is not immoral to ask somebody if he will leave some of his property with the court in order to ensure that thereby he may be released from prison. Let us understand that that is the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that there are cases in which, if subsection (3) were omitted, the fiscal would merely say "I object to bail". Instead of that, he is able to say "I will object to bail, unless the court considers that this is a case in whose special circumstances the deposit of a large sum fo money would be appropriate."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
It is not a question, either, of "your passport or a deposit of money". It is a question of imprisonment, refusal of bail, or a deposit of money in these special circumstances, and these alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) said, some people are financially motivated—as I dare say those who vote in the House of Commons tomorrow evening will demonstrate. There is occasionally a situation in which a person will be controlled by a large deposit of money. I am horrified that the hon. Members for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)—one would expect it from the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth—who allegedly have professional standards, take such a poor view of the other members of their profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said that nothing will change. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, when the hon. Member for Falkirk, Stirling and Grangemouth was in Government, he never ceased to say that the magistrates of Scotland were the brightest and best and most excellent people one could find. These are the very same people, who it is said, will deliberately misinterpret an absolutely clear statutory provision. If they do, by any chance, ever misinterpret the purposes of this clear statutory provision, there will be appeals. That is the manner in which the judges, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, will give instructions to the sheriffs. That is the method in law in which the appeal courts lay down and interpret the meaning of special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that it is absolutely the intention and will be the experience that these deposits will be used in exceptional circumstances, however few they may be. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden said, he is so terrified of the spectre of these rogue magistrates and sheriffs, who apparently play such a large part in his life, that lest one should appear in a nightmare before him, he wants all those whom it would be appropriate to release on a deposit of money to be kept in prison in the meantime. That does not seem to me an equitable way of legislating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said that he would say in all honesty that we will have made no progress, that we will be back in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Victorian age, if we do not cut out subsection (3). I think that puts his honesty on a pretty fair footing, because, in fact, this reform removes the ordinary money bail; it retains, in special circumstances, the right to ask for a deposit of money as a condition of release—in other words, as a condition of the grant of bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland has two or three times said that "it retains in special circumstances", but he has never yet defined those special circumstances, and he should understand that that is the dilemma the Committee is in. We do not know the special circumstances to which anybody has referred, let alone the Solicitor-General for Scotland. What are the special circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth will remember—complain though he did—that it was the judges of the Senate of the College of Justice who requested that there should be substantial deposits as an available condition of release in cases of illegal fishing, fraud and the like. They are the people, the same people, who will be the appeal court, so it is not difficult, even if we had not already discussed it in Committee, to know the sort of case and the special circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what is now being said—and it is better that we put it on the record—I could be persuaded that the only cases under which money will be imposed as a condition of bail are fishing cases—though normally the vessel is retained anyway—fraud and embezzlement. Is that what is meant? That is what the Solicitor-General for Scotland has just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I just said. The cases in which it will be made as a condition will be cases where the court or the Lord Advocate is satisfied that the imposition of such a condition is appropriate to the special circumstances of the case—of which those are examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other examples. For instance, corruption in local government is a good example. There are other examples of cases which, because of their technicality, take a great deal of time to prepare and in which, in other circum-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
stances, the person would not have bean granted bail. But because of the 110-day rule, for his release—and it may be appropriate in such a case—such a condition is imposed. Those are the sort of cases, but the reasons have to be made out before it can be done, otherwise, as subsection (1) says, it is not lawful to impose such a condition. It has to be made out that it is appropriate to the special circumstances of that case. It is never possible, as the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth knows, to anticipate what crimes will be committed. Indeed, had I suggested that another suitable case, for instance, would be piracy, hon. Members would have said "Piracy? That went out 150 years ago." It did not. It was back in Aberdeen about 15 years ago. So there are cases. I am not making a definitive list.

He then went on to refer to them as "The egg and chip courts"—as we used to call them colloquially—and took the view that their powers should be restricted.

If that is what he believes, I have no doubt that any magistrate, sheriff or judge who goes

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
outside the words of subsection (3) will be appealed against by the hon. Member for Garscadden on the instructions of his client, and I have not the slightest doubt that the appeal court will uphold him if the circumstances are not appropriate and special.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point, made by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock), that there are appeal procedures. However, appeal procedures take time to operate. If bail is refused, it means that the person will probably spend two or three nights in Barlinnie. He may get interim liberation, but that depends upon the judge who has set bail. The person may not get it, and there is a real prospect that he will end up in Barlinnie for two or three nights. By then, at least, part of the damage has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I note that these rogue magistrates who cause such paranoid concern on the Opposition Benches apparently are going to be able to be completely sane, rational and decent when it comes to imposing any conditions they like as a condition of release.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland has piled on the agony. The debate has led me even more firmly to the conclusion that the Government are about to insist on the blindest provision that has ever been included in any piece of Government legislation. The Solicitor-General for Scotland has said nothing. He has given no indication about the circumstances in which money bail would be appropriate. Hon. Members heard me trying to press him on the specific cases for which it would be used. He agreed that these cases were appropriate but went on to extend the list. If I had pressed him further there is no doubt that the list would have been extended further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It brings me back to the point on which the Solicitor-General for Scotland was ridiculing me. We have made no progress at all. Anyone who wants to retain this provision within the Bill is in favour of making no progress. I hope that, if I have not been able to achieve it, the Solicitor-General for Scotland has done a much batter job than I to convince his hon. Friends that this provision should be removed from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>necessary that, in removing money bail from the usual regulation of these matters, it is important and appropriate that conditions should be attached to the grant of bail.</p>
	<p>That, of course, was the recommendation of the second report of the Thomson committee. Paragraph 11.19 of the report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We agree that conditions along the lines
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
indicated in paragraph 11.14	<i>b,</i> with the exception of reporting to police stations, should, where appropriate, be made conditions of release in both solemn and summary procedure."</p></blockquote>
However, if one refers back to 11.14	<i>b,</i> one sees that it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most of our witnesses were in favour of it being made competent for the court to attach conditions to bail, for example, surrendering of passports, staying at a certain address, refraining from visiting a named witness, reporting to a police station at stated times."</p></blockquote>
I accept that if one considers the particular examples put by witnesses before the Thomson committee, it was indeed desirable that they should be included in this Bill. But what causes me concern, and why I have tabled the amendment, is that, in my view, it is not necessary to have clause 1(	<i>2</i>)(	<i>b</i>):—
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not commit an offence while on bail"—</p></blockquote>
because the particular sets of circumstance that those witnesses and the Thomson committee itself considered are more than adequately covered by the remainder of the types of conditions suggested, namely, subsection (2) (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>). I should have regard, in particular, to the provisions of (	<i>c</i>), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice whether in relation to himself or any other person."</p></blockquote>
I accept the importance and desirability of that. But I do not fully comprehend why paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is considered necessary. I am concerned that potentially curious circumstances might arise here.</p>
	<p>With the respect that the Solicitor-General for Scotland used to exhibit to me when I acted as his junior in the High Court of Glasgow, he accused me, on Second Reading, of misinterpreting this provision. Perhaps my remarks then were too brief, so I shall elaborate my cause for concern in order that he may understand precisely how I misinterpreted it.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall spell it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect that the court would ever impose a condition that the person to be granted bail should not commit the crime of assault until his next trial. I see
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
that, but that is not what is proposed. But I should be interested to hear the specific conditions that the Solicitor-General for Scotland suggests might be imposed in such circumstances to ensure that someone does not commit an offence while on bail. The court proceeds now, and always must proceed, on the assumption that the sanction of the criminal law is sufficient to prevent people committing crimes. If that is not correct, it is for this House to amend the substantive criminal law of Scotland or to review the sentencing provisions applicable to those crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, if the view is that someone is likely to commit a crime pending his trial, the courts would, as they have done in the past, say "No. You are staying in detention until your trial is concluded." That would occur in all sorts of circumstances—a case involving an habitual housebreaker, or someone who had repeatedly committed the serious crime of rape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am misinterpreting this provision, I shall be interested to hear what the Solicitor-General for Scotland has to say, but I do not understand what he is talking about in relation to this condition. There are two sets of circumstances in which such a condition could be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a man who has seriously assaulted his wife and has embarked upon a continuing campaign of assault upon her. Instead of keeping him in detention, it might be suggested that a condition be attached that he was not to visit his wife's house. In those circumstances, such a condition would be caught by paragraph (	<i>c</i>) anyway. If that condition were imposed and he seriously assaulted his wife, not only would he be subject to conviction on that charge, but also for a breach of the condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the man may go to the house without committing anything that would be recognised by the law of Scotland as a crime, but nevertheless, because the visit amounts to a breach of the condition, he may find himself subjected to the penalties allowed for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that that sort of circumstance already exists in the civil law of Scotland, where we have interdict. If, in the circumstances I have outlined, a husband were to go to his wife's house and make a nuisance of himself, his actions may fall short of something like breach of the peace. Nevertheless, by breaching
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
the terms of that interdict, he would find himself liable to penalties for contempt of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what concerns me is that, if there is to be such a condition, if granted it must be so precise that the person on whom it is imposed is left in no doubt whatever what he must or must not do. There should be a similar sort of test to that one finds applied to interdicts. However, it is not only the man or woman in question who must be in absolutely no doubt as to what is the condition and its ambit. Every policeman in the country must, of course, be aware of its precise ambit, because, under clause 3(7), an arrest without warrant would be possible where a constable had reasonable grounds for suspecting that an accused—I take this to the extreme—was likely to break any conditions imposed on bail. However, with clause 3(7) if Mrs. Smith lives at the end of the High Street, and the accused, Mr. Smith, is walking along the High Street, this juxtaposition gives me cause for concern. I have some anxiety in this matter in that it could allow for an extension of circumstances in which people might find themselves liable to penalties which certainly do not exist at present in the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, my anxieties in this matter would have been allayed had not my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland, said on Second Reading that on the question of law and order he had a duty to reassure that the same criteria would apply to the grant or refusal of bail as hitherto. I hesitate to say that the line taken in the Bill in any way apes the provisions of the English statute—I do not wish to arouse the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)—but it concerns me that there is a similar type of provision within the English statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> will correct me if I am wrong about this matter of the practice of English law, but as I understand it, why this is allowed for in the law of England and the way in which it is interpreted in England is that it amounts to a widening of the circumstances in which bail would be allowed. If that is the case and if, indeed, that is the intention of my hon. and learned Friend, I wish that he would not be coy about taking some pride in the reform and widening of the scope of bail that is to be provided for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present problem in the courts is that
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
if the sheriff or the judge on appeal considers that the accused is likely to commit an offence while the trial is pending, he will take one simple decision. That will be: "No, you will remain in prison until your trial is concluded." If I correctly understand what is done in England, that crude simple decision would not be taken—the sheriff or judge would make a rather more careful analysis of the situation to see whether he could impose some condition that, while recognising that the accused was some sort of danger to the public or to specific individuals, nevertheless, given a particular condition, he might be granted bail while otherwise he would not. In the present circumstances he would most certainly not be granted bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the intention of the Solicitor-General for Scotland in this matter, I repeat that many of my anxieties would be relieved. However, I would like to hear what he has to say, specifically, about the types of conditions that would be imposed. I have referred to the question of a wife, but it might be a public house in the High Street—"You are not to go to that public house"—and I believe that the same sort of problems could arise in that instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another amendment standing in relation to clause 3(7). You will notice Mr. Gourlay, that to some extent I have strayed into consideration of that matter, and I hope that you will forgive me. It seems to me that the two inter-relate, and, although I shall have more to say on that later, I mention it now because it has a particular bearing on this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if the Committee decides to leave clause 1 (2)(	<i>b</i>) within the Bill, it will be kept under the closest review by the Crown Office. We do not want to see any extension into vague and unenforceable conditions that might otherwise result without that proper review and attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
I think I am able to relieve many of the anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). He has enough anxieties already in having succeeded in being elected a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the intention of the Bill to do much more than simply to ensure that people turn up for trial; it seeks to try to liberalise conditions and make it possible for more people to be released than are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put the matter in balance. Of course, if somebody is charged with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
committing an offence, though they are presumed to be innocent, it has, from time to time, to be presumed, in considering whether they should be granted release, that perhaps they actually committed the offence. It is on the basis that they did commit it that persons are detained in custody pending their trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there is an interest of public safety, and the interests of public safety are that a person should not commit another offence as a result of being released. The reason that persons are not granted bail is frequently for fear that they would commit another offence. Furthermore, the public would be extremely anxious if no sooner did the police catch the "Ripper" or the "Black Panther", than they simply charged him and he was released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to balance the interest of public safety, and clearly, if a condition can be imposed which makes it less likely that a person will commit an offence while on bail but enables that person to be released as a result of that condition, they should be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give a few examples. If someone is charged with throwing a bottle in a football park, a condition can be imposed that that person may not go to any football stadium as a condition of his release. If a person is charged with assault in a certain public house, as a condition of his release that person could be told that he could not visit that or any other public house. If a person is charged with baby battering, it could be a condition of his release that the child would be, in the meantime, taken into care by its aunt, or something of that kind. There are many cases and types of cases in which it would be appropriate to impose a condition which did its best to guarantee public safety while, at the same time, achieving the benefit of release which would otherwise have been refused. I hope that satisfies my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one matter on which I should be grateful for elucidation. Let us take one of the examples given by my hon. and learned Friend. If the thug whom he wishes to prevent from committing a further offence, instead of going to Tynecastle, this week goes to Easter Road and throws another bottle, in those circumstances does the Solicitor-General for Scotland say that in respect of that single actus the thug would be subjected first to the penalty that would
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
arise from his breach of the peace or assault and, secondly, to the penalty for the breach of the condition that was imposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
That, of course, is what happens at present. If another offence is committed while one is on bail, one will be rearrested and it is unlikely that one will be granted bail again. However, if there were such a circumstance, a person would not be charged with both the offence that he committed and with the breach of the condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there could ever be a fair condition to be imposed on a bank robber or a rapist to the effect that "I shall release you on condition that you do not commit rape or rob another bank before your trial." That would be an unrealistic condition which the Appeal Court would not uphold or tolerate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if there are special circumstances which would prevent a likely repetition of behaviour that was, in fact, complained of as being criminal, it seems that it would be appropriate for there to be such a condition to attain that end. It would not mean that by breach of that condition, which involved the committing of a criminal offence, one would be charged for the same actus with two offences. I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
matter. It is an attempt to limit the cases in which money bail can be imposed. The Solicitor-General for Scotland will be aware that it came from a speech that he made during proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which failed. At one point he suggested this measure as a possible solution to difficulties which he then saw clearly, but which now he sees somewhat less clearly. As so often happens, I was attracted to one of the hon. and learned Gentleman's ideas and am glad to lay it again before him, with hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can follow the example of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I shall be very brief in my comments about amendment No. 5, which stands in my name. The amendment tries to persuade the Solicitor-General for Scotland to look again at the effect of clause 1 (3) to see whether it is capable of restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are restricted to the High Court—that is, to the superior court—some of the worries that were mentioned earlier might evaporate. Certainly, it would limit the risk of any possible abuse remaining. Amendment No. 5 suggests that the option of money bail should be restricted to the High Court, or, in one special circumstance, to the sheriff court—namely, in relation to sea fishery statutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I associate myself with the amendment that has been tabled by the hon. Member for Garscadden, although I think that it may have a weakness in it, in that prosecutions under the sea fishery statutes are, as I understand it, normally taken under summary procedure, rather than on petition. I shall stand corrected if the opposite proves the case. However, it has always been my impression that although the penalties for illegal fishing are substantial, they are normally taken on peremptory, or summary, jurisdiction rather than a more severe course. In that case, the exception which has always proved very valid—that money bail is needed to deal with fishery cases would not be dealt with by the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Garscadden. Could the Government give some consideration to limiting the effect of subsection (3), along the lines that have been suggested by the hon. Gentleman and myself? That would certainly be appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate and am sympathetic to both the amendments. However, the difficulty is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
that although the original suggestion, or adumbration, came from myself—that may be one one reason why I am attracted to the argument—in fact, neither solution works. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) complains that the amendment of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) does not work, but I complain that neither works, for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that at the time that bail is being considered one may not know in what court the matter will end, or whether it will be on petition, indictment or summary. It is not possible at that stage to restrict it to those conditions. What it would mean, no doubt, would be a tendency to be guided by that situation and to say "We want money bail in this case, therefore we shall put it on indictment or in the High Court". I think that would be an unfortunate reversal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a considerable number of serious cases which, even if that had been decided, at the time of bail do not necessarily go to the High Court and are not necessarily on petition. If one takes for example somebody who is to be charged with a long-term fraud, corruption or something of that kind, often there is what might be termed a holding charge upon which a person is charged with failure to lodge accounts or some technical contravention of a section under the Companies Act. That would not be a case which would fall within the category but would be a case in which one would want to impose as a condition a substantial sum of money bail. That is why, unfortunately, the categories do not work. All the common law cases could be taken summarily, on petition or in any court. That is the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I have great sympathy, I am afraid that neither of these solutions has come into an effective categorisation. All I can say to the two learned solicitors opposite—I believe we have a team of seven advocates on this side and one lay magistrate—is that they will have to train as philosopher-kings as well as solicitors before these amendments will be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Again this is an effort to seek to restrict the effects of clause 1 (3). The reason for the change I suggest can be put extremely briefly—the word "special" is capable of more general application, if I may use that term in the circumstances, than would be the use of the word "exceptional". "Exceptional" would tend to drive the meaning home to all those concerned that the intention of the Government is to abolish money bail and that only in very limited circumstances indeed would money bail prove useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my view that the word "exceptional" would be a better word to deploy than "special". We are in some difficulty in the absence of the guidelines which were referred to previously, but it is a question of choice of word, and I hope that the change suggested may prove attractive to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the word "exceptional", or some other term to limit the application of this clause, I hope that will take care of it by reference to their proposed guidelines. But I should like to press the slight tightening up which is contained in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would possibly have been attracted to this amendment had it not been for an experience I had in the case of the Procurator Fiscal v.

In his judgment, Lord Wheatley refused this petition and said that the 	<i>nobile officium</i> should be used only exceptionally and sparingly. In other words, it should not be used when it is appropriate but just once every 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have the word wanted by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) there would be a problem. Suppose we have four members—'that is most unlikely—of the Dundee local authority charged with corruption on the same morning. It is appropriate that each should have a substantial money deposit as
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
a condition of his release. It is appropriate that they should be released. Number one is released. However, that is "exceptional". So we have to keep the others in custody otherwise it would become unexceptional. It is for that fallacy that I think the word "special" is a much wiser word and one which is more appropriate.

	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that such address constituting the domicile of citation shall not be the office of the clerk of court".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is to deal with a practice which has prevailed hitherto in the sheriff courts, namely, that when someone obtains bail his domicile of citation is given, on matters under the solemn procedure, as the sheriff clerk's office. I made reference to this in earlier proceedings under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. I found it strange that those who were being prosecuted under summary procedure could have their names and home addresses given to the press while those who were to be prosecuted under the more serious form of procedure were able to be disguised—to remain anonymous—pending the time of their trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read clause 2, I am not sure whether this provision for the domicile of citation of the sheriff court might be hidden. It seems to be the intention of the Government to eliminate that practice and to substitute some other address—either the home address, or an accommodation address and so on—for the accused person. I consider it preferable that the original and bad practice of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sympathetic to the amendment, but like others it does not get round the difficulty that it is trying to cure. If one is not allowed to give this address—and I have always objected to "care of the sheriff clerk"—all one need do is put one's address as "care of my solicitor's office". It is difficult to find words in which the person cannot equally avoid or keep comparative or geographical anonymity. The amendment would not achieve it. If it is then said that there has to be a domiciliary address, the person can ask his chum up the road to let him use his address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to find a form of words which would achieve the requirement for one, so to speak, to bare one's breast to the press. We should remember that while that is a desirable objective the principal purpose of the address that is given is to ensure that the person can be reached and that documents can be sent to him when needed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman, but does he not think that it would be preferable to have at least some restriction? Whereas an accused may seek, for his own reasons, to give the address of his own solicitors—it is a matter, then, for the court to decide whether that is an appropriate address to accept in exchange for the grant of bail—previously, when bail was granted, a domicile of citation was almost universally accepted as the sheriff clerk's office. If we cut out the automatic application of the sheriff clerk's office for the purposes of citation for which it was originally intended, that would at least block one loophole, even if we do not succeed in blocking the attempt of a person determined to remain anonymous by using the address of his solicitors or some other accommodation address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government are considering the possibility of some civilian process of service. That, in my view, would achieve in practice the result that the hon. Gentleman seeks.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a formidable-looking jungle of amendments, but they all relate to one point which repeats itself right through the Bill. It is an attempt to cure what seems to me to be a rather strange anomaly in the mechanism for sentencing for breach of a condition of bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that, initially, I did not give this matter much consideration. At that time I was more interested in changing the whole basis on which the offence was committed—the argument about contempt of court. Perhaps for that reason I did not give enough attention to what was actually in clause 3 which—I ought to point out, in fairness to the Government—was in the Labour Government's Criminal Justice Bill, which appeared before the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the clause amounts to is that, if a person is allowed bail on conditions and he makes the mistake of failing to obey those conditions, breaching those conditions he is guilty of an offence and he can be fined a figure not exceeding £200. If solemn proceedings are involved, if the case is being taken before sheriff and jury, the person can be subject to an unlimited fine. We might argue about that, but I have no objection to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part interests me more. The clause then goes on to say that, apart from a fine, a person can also be sent to prison for a period of up to two years—that is a very long period—but imprisonment depends upon the person being sent to prison for the original charge on which he was allowed bail. In other words, there is a strange situation in which the two are linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discretion of the sheriff—or the discretion of the judge, if the case is in the High Court—as to how he deals with breach of conditions is very directly conditioned by what he does in the way of sentencing the person on the original
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
charge—if a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed, or is being imposed. A sentence of imprisonment has to be imposed before the additional sentence of imprisonment for the breach of condition can result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> and I have been united throughout our discussion in the sense of having been united in error on the matter of whether it should be dealt with as contempt of court. We then recanted in unison. The hon. and learned Gentleman will have noted that I have not put down any amendments to return to contempt of court. I accept that I was wrong about that and, on reflection, I agree entirely that it should be a separate offence, although in certain circumstances it may in execution be a little clumsy. But that is a price we will have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the important point about my group of amendments. If we say that it is not contempt of court, but is a separate offence that must be dealt with on a separate basis, I suggest that we should not link the powers to sentence to the original offence in the way being proposed. I believe as a matter of general legal principle that, if there is a separate offence, the judge should be left to deal with that offence on its merits. One should not say to him "All right, deal with the case on its merits, but subject to the proviso that you cannot send him to gaol because you have not imposed a custodial sentence for the original offence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, I am tempted, as I always am, —the Solicitor-General for Scotland may be horrified—by the argument that it is a clever way he has thought up of limiting the powers to send people to prison. On the whole, I do not like people being sent to prison, though, unfortunately, it is often necessary. But it is attractive to say that that means, at least, that however ill-intentioned the judge, if, he cannot find a way of sending the person to prison on the original offence, he is stymied from passing a vindictive sentence for breach of probation. That may be attractive, but it is a mistaken approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that one may have to be a little ingenious, but it is possible to construct, for example, a situation in which it might be in the interests of justice that someone should serve a short gaol sentence for breach of conditions, but, in fact, for the original offence for which he was placed on bail, he would not, in any proper way, be sent to prison. There-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
fore, the judge or sheriff, would be faced with the invidious choice of saying either "I will send him to gaol initially for the original offence in order to gaol him for this hideous breach of probation", or, " I will have to impose a sentence which is not really appropriate because I am limited in the powers obtaining in terms of section 3 of the Bail etc (Scotland) Act", as it will be by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general legal principle that this limitation upon a judge's discretion, this linking to his earlier decision on that totally separate offence, is dangerous. The kind of example one might come across is the old semi-matrimonial view that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) spoke of. For example, where a man is involved in an extremely difficult matrimonial situation that ends up in the sheriff court after a minor breach of the peace, I could certainly imagine the sheriff saying "I will grant you bail, after some hesitation, but only on the assumption and condition that you do not return to the matrimonial home", as it may have become apparent that there is a tense and difficult situation in that man's home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose the man then breaches that condition and goes to the matrimonial home either because no separate charge is laid or because what the man does in the home does not amount to assault—although he may, in the view of the sheriff, have caused a great deal of distress that could be a serious breach of the bail conditions—the sheriff, if he thought it inappropriate to impose a gaol sentence for the original, minor, breach of the peace for which the man first appeared, could not, of course, consider any possibility of custodial sentence at the second stage because of that factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said enough to illustrate a simple point, but one that I regard as an important matter of principle. I do not like the linkage in that sort of way. Despite my much-commented-on suspicion about the judiciary—and here I appear as a defender of its independence—I believe that if it is appropriate to say that for breach of conditions one can fine up to £200 and the other possibility is gaol for up to three months, as it is here on the summary causes, it is a matter that should be left to the discretion of the judges. It should be "£200 or" and not "£200 and", if he is being gaoled anyway for a totally separate offence. If these are two totally distinct offences, the sentencing on the second
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
should not be linked to the sentencing on the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have made that point clearly and I hope the Government will consider it sympathetically. In terms of legal principle, it is a matter of some interest and importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Under-Secretary of State for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). He has suggested that his lengthy group of amendments covers only one point. When we considered them, they seemed to include two quite distinct points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment first on amendments Nos. 12, 16, 36, 40 and 44. They seek to leave out the word "and" and insert the word "or". We understood that the hon. Gentleman was concerned that it might be obligatory upon a court, where a breach of condition had taken place, to fine and, where appropriate, impose a sentence of imprisonment. I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that the word "and" in no way requires that both sentences be imposed at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the substantive points that the hon. Member for Garscadden raised. His main argument, which he put forward lucidly and fairly, was that he felt it to be inappropriate that the sentence of imprisonment for a breach of condition should be available to the court only if it was intending to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the original offence. I understand that that matter was also raised by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties in its submission to hon. Members. The Government accept, on reflection, that it would be inappropriate for the discretion of the court to be restricted in this substantial way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously enough, the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties and the hon. Member for Garscadden are arguing for the potential imprisonment of a person who has breached a condition of bail to be extended. That would in no way assist the accused and limit the occasions on which he might be imprisoned. It would give the courts greater discretion to use imprisonment. Perhaps the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, if not the hon. Member, was not aware of that when it put forward so lucidly the recommendation before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member will agree to withdraw these amendments—we are not entirely happy with their drafting, but we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
accept the principle of what he has said—we shall give serious consideration to putting forward at a later stage amendments which would serve a similar purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, leave out lines 16 to 18 and insert "original offence".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Government amendments Nos. 18 and 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical and drafting matter and the amendment corrects an omission in the Bill. Clause 3(3)(	<i>6</i>) provides, in relation to solemn proceedings only, for the situation where the charge is changed between the granting of bail and the trial on that matter. It is necessary to make similar provision for summary proceedings in clause 3(2)(	<i>b</i>). That is done by adjusting the wording of subsections (2)(	<i>b</i>) and (3)(	<i>b</i>) and providing an interpretation of "original offence" in a new subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment corrects an omission in the original drafting of the Bill. It does not provide any new point of policy or principle. Therefore, I hope the Committee will agree to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 20, in page 3, line 34, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"such sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position that these amendments seek to achieve is, as I understand it, a reflection of what the Bill itself seeks to achieve—namely, the creation of a specific and separate offence out of the failure of an accused to appear in court at his diet of trial. As I understood it, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
debate on the principle, made it clear that that was the purpose of this part of the Bill. He referred to the powerful case put forward by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) for having even stiffer penalties in respect of proceedings which were solemn proceedings. It is my understanding that the idea is to try to create a deterrence against accused persons absconding and failing to appear for their diet of trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deterrence is dependent upon the penalties and on whether they are sufficiently alarming to an accused person to act as a deterrent against his absconding. It seems that the only way that that could be achieved is where a sentence for this new specific crime of absconding is imposed as a consecutive sentence to that passed for the original offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may have heard, Mr. Gourlay, of a famous Glasgow solicitor who once described absconding as the last right of the guilty man. However, it is the intention of this provision to make sure that that last right is exercised as infrequently as possible. My experience is that where a guilty person absconds, it is normally because he is conscious of his guilt. If that person, in deciding whether or not to appear for his diet of trial, knows that in the normal course of events, as so often happens where there are a number of different charges on the same indictment, the judge is likely to pass separate sentences on each one but to allow them to run concurrently so that in effect that person will not serve any longer term in prison for his failure to appear than he would have had he appeared, it seems to me that the deterrent effect of the provision disappears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that this is a matter which is strongly enough put in the Bill in order to try to create this deterrence which, after all, is there to protect the administration of justice. In this particular case the judges should be required to impose consecutive sentences so that any person who is thinking of absconding knows that if he does abscond and is caught and brought back to trial he will be punished and have to serve further and stiffer imprisonment because he has created this offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. I am certainly deeply opposed—as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) will not be surprised to know—to the suggestion that this must be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
consecutive and must be added on at the end of the original sentence. I should have thought that it was a matter for judicial discretion. If the trial judge wishes to make it consecutive, I see no reason why we should hinder him. He is in possession of all the facts; he has heard the mitigation. It seems ridiculous to say that irrespective of the special circumstances, he should be prohibited from passing what he thinks is an appropriate sentence and should also have to make the condition that it would be consecutive on the sentence which had been passed on the original offence. It would be very wrong if the Government were to give countenance or support to this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that perhaps I am straying a little out of order, but it may save the time of the Committee. These amendments are linked to a further group—amendments Nos. 21, 38 and 42—which appear further down the selection list. It may be that the Solicitor-General for Scotland or the Under-Secretary—I am not clear which Under-Secretary—might want to deal with both, or perhaps they would wish to leave it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Does the Under-Secretary wish to leave it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is agreeable to you, Mr. Gourlay, I should be happy to take this second group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee agrees, together with the amendments now under discussion we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 21, in page 4, line 1, leave out from "impose" to the end of line 3.</p>
	<p>No. 38, in clause 7, page 6, line 38, leave out from "impose" to end of line 40.</p>
	<p>No. 42, in clause 7, page 7, line 30, leave out from "impose" to end of line 33.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are in the same field. These are probing amendments and they are down because they do not enforce a consecutive sentence but make it clear that a consecutive sentence is possible, even if it takes the total sentence over the normal upper sentencing limit. In other words, in the sheriff court at present a sheriff may, on a sheriff and jury trial, sentence a man to two years on any one indictment but he cannot sentence him to more than two years, however many charges there may be on that indictment. Two years is the limit,
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
and if the sheriff thinks the sentence should be more than two years he must remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill invites us not to go as far as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) would like and say that sentences must always be consecutive, but it is still clear that they can be consecutive, even if it takes the time up to three years. I may be wrong—I have not done the research for this and the Under-Secretary of State will be able to help me—but I cannot think of any other circumstances in which a sentence of three years' imprisonment could be passed by a sheriff on one indictment in the sheriff court. But on my reading of the Bill that is quite clearly the implication of the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notwithstanding that the total of penalties imposed may exceed the maximum penalty which it is competent to impose in respect of the original offence."</p></blockquote>
I felt it was worth tabling the amendments because I have doubt about whether that general rule should be breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that if the sheriff, on considering the indictment, comes to the conclusion that he wants to give 18 months or two years for the original offence and intends to add a year for breach of probation, which is clearly within his powers, he should remit the case to the High Court for sentence. Otherwise we are breaching an important present procedural rule that sheriffs cannot go above the two-year limit. There are many cases where there have been arguments about two indictments, which arose from the same circumstances, and even there the High Court has held that on two indictments it is incompetent for the sheriff court to make the total amount to more than two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are breaching an important barrier here. We seem to be doing it on the side or on the backhand. I am not sure that it is wise to introduce a creeping upper limit for the sheriff court in this way. If we are saying that sheriffs should be able to impose more than a two-year sentence we should have a clause to that effect, and perhaps we should consider whether they should not be able to impose more than two years in other circumstancess. But I think that this one slightly strange exception smuggled in—I do not mean that in a pejorative sense—almost by accident as a adjunct to a very different Bill dealing with bail conditions is a dangerous precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that the Government agree with his general observations. If a person is charged with breaking conditions of bail and is brought before the court on an offence in connection with that, the Government accept—it is part of the purpose of the Bill—that the court should deal specifically with that offence and impose the penalty that it considers appropriate to it. In many circumstances, the court will wish to ensure that any sentence of imprisonment is consecutive and not concurrent with any other sentence imposed simultaneously. Clearly, that would be an appropriate method of dealing with an accused person in a very large proportion of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will accept that if his amendment were agreed to there could be no discretion for the court in all circumstances, irrespective of the view that the court took of the seriousness of the situation or of any other factors relevant to the matters before it, and a sentence would have to be imposed consecutively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be inappropriate and against the spirit of the Bill to reduce the discretion of the court in that way. It would also make this matter quite unique in our criminal courts because, as far as I am aware, there are no other circumstances in which the judge is required to impose a sentence of imprisonment to run consecutively and not concurrently. I believe that, on balance, it is more appropriate that these matters be left to the courts to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I can reassure my hon. Friend —perhaps in the process of so doing I may antagonise the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—by referring him to clause 3(5). As the hon. Member for Garscadden has pointed out, clause 3(5) makes specific provision that if by granting a sentence of imprisonment the court imposes a total sentence of imprisonment greater than would normally be appropriate, nevertheless, that will be acceptable and permitted under the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me to the points made by the hon. Member for Garscadden and the additional amendments which he has spoken to. He suggested that the Government, as it were, were slipping this in by the back door. I can only remind him that this particular provision existed in the Criminal (Scotland) Justice Bill introduced
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
by the Labour Government in the last Parliament. It was not commented upon at the time and did not appear to be controversial to the hon. Gentleman when he sat on this side of the Committee—although it may be the case that he just did not notice it. That may be the most likely explanation why this is the first time the matter has been aired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are anxious to achieve—I am sure that the hon. Member will agree with this—is to minimise the inconvenience and waste of time in these matters. If this provision were not to be included in the Bill, all that would happen in a very large proportion of cases is that the offence of breaching a condition of bail would simply be brought on a separate indictment and have to be dealt with quite separately by the sheriff court—if that was the appropriate court—which would be able to impose a sentence up to the maximum permitted in the legislation. In no way would this prevent or remove from an accused person any particular potential sentence that would otherwise be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it would be most unfortunate if we were to insist that only by bringing a separate indictment was the full penalty imposed for breach of a condition to be available to the court, because all that would happen then would be that procurators fiscal or others who were contemplating prosecution would obviously bring a separate indictment. This would be wasting the time of the court, it would not be helpful to the accused, it would cost substantially extra in terms of resources and at the end of the day the result would be exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if the hon. Gentleman will reflect on this aspect of the matter, I believe that he will agree—or he should agree—that in these circumstances it is much more in line with the requirements of common sense that we include this provision at subsection (5), thereby ensuring that the interests of justice are properly served. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a Division. The Government feel, for the reasons I have indicated, that it makes far more sense to keep the Bill in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am not convinced. Subject, of course, to the failure of another amendment in my name, it would be possible under this provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
for an accused to get up to four years in a sheriff court—two years for the original complaint and up to two years for the breach of bail conditions. That seems to me to be a very big departure from the present limitations on the sheriff court. I accept that there may be some convenience in the arguments of the Under-Secretary, but I am sure that the Solicitor-General for Scotland, and, indeed, the Under-Secretary of State, will agree that convenience can sometimes be a great threat to the proper standards of a legal system. In this case, at least, I would not be prepared to support a doubling—admittedly in specific circumstances—of the upper sentence which can be imposed in a sheriff court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman and I agree that if it were simply a matter of convenience it would be entirely inappropriate to make such a change. But it is not simply a question of convenience. It is a convenience to the court but in a form that, in practice, will not make the slightest bit of difference to an accused person, because, for the reasons I have indicated, if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were to be accepted these charges of breaking bail conditions would simply be brought on a separate indictment. Therefore, the court would have exactly the same powers as the Government propose, that is, to impose a sentence up to the maximum of two years, so the accused's interests would not be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman's view were to be accepted, all that would happen is that the accused would have to appear twice, the court would have to consider the matter on two separate occasions, and no doubt the profession to which various hon. Members belong would be enhanced. But apart from that particular consideration—which I am sure will have no bearing on the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 19, in page 3, line 34, leave out "2 years" and insert "one year".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that when we debated this matter on Second Reading, I drew attention to the point that it was an extension of the previous Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. In fact, while we have been bandying remarks back and forth across the Committee about provisions that were contained in the previous Bill, this provision was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the matter on Second Reading, the Solicitor-General, said that he had been persuaded by the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). I made the observation at that time that I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Dundee, East, while arguing for stiffer penalties, meant to go to the lengths that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Government appear to have gone in suggesting—and in implementing through legislation—that the prison sentence that could be imposed for a breach of bail conditions in a bail case taken under solemn procedure, could be up to two years. I got the sense, from what the hon. Member for Dundee, East said later in the debate, that I had guessed correctly—that the deed went beyond what even the hon. Gentleman had expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our reason for this amendment is two-fold. First, we believe that two years is far too severe. Secondly, we are anxious to hear the two-year period justified. No justification was given for the selection of the two-year period of imprisonment for a breach of bail conditions for a case taken on solemn proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the Under-Secretary of State's comments on Second Reading, when—rightly, in my view—he placed heavy emphasis on the likely effect that the Bill would have on the prison population. As we go through the Bill, we all have an obligation to consider its likely effect on the prison population. That is why I agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in his contribution to the previous debate, and why I disagree with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) about the lack of discretion given to judges in deciding whether sentences should run consecutively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised if any member of the Committee doubted that this type of provision, whereby a two-year prison sentence can be imposed for a breach of bail conditions taken in solemn proceedings, would have some effect, however slight—I am not trying to exaggerate the problem—on the prison population in Scotland, particularly if, in the case of the sheriff court, the sheriffs were to exercise the discretion which the Bill seeks to give them, whereby they can impose a prison sentence of up to two years and then impose another prison sentence of up to two years, because the bail conditions have been breached. Whereas, in the original case, the offender would serve two years, less remission for good conduct, if this kind of provision were imposed, the offender would serve four years. No one could argue that that would not have an effect on the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are anxious to hear the two-year period justified. We believe—
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
I certainly do and no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden does also—that a two-year prison sentence would be far too severe for a breach of bail conditions in the circumstances that most of us would have in mind. I know that an accidental breach of bail conditions would not be punished. I do not seek to exaggerate a problem. Like every other member of the Committee, I could quote case after case of people being apprehended because they are supposed to have breached their bail conditions, when the whole thing has been a misunderstanding. We are anxious to know how the Government came to the view that a two-year prison sentence was appropriate for the kind of offence we are discussing. We are also concerned to hear whether any assessment has been made of the likely effect on the prison population, however minimal. I know it will be minimal, but in the next four or five years the prison service will have to bear its share of public expenditure cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us put that on record. The Under-Secretary just said that the prison service will not be asked to take public expenditure cuts. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made clear on a number of occasions that law and order services, as well as certain areas of public expenditure, will not be included in their public expenditure restraint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Nevertheless, the prison population will be affected, however minimally, and the Government have a duty to tell us whether that effect has been assessed and how they arrived at the two-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one or two comments on the remarks of the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). He seems totally to have misunderstood the provision. He referred throughout his remarks to a two-year sentence for breach of bail conditions. This provision relates only to failure to appear for the trial diet. The Bill creates a separate and serious offence out of the failure to appear at the trial diet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may well have referred to breach of bail conditions, but I should have said failure to appear at the trial diet. I apologise for that slip-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I merely raised the matter because had the sentence been imposed for breach of other bail conditions, I should have tended to agree with his remarks. But the offence is separate. It is vital, if the administration of criminal law in Scotland is not to be hampered by increasing numbers of people who fail to turn up for their trial date, that the offence must be seriously regarded and the sentences for it be severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two-year period is a maximum. We have talked this morning about the discretion of judges from different points of view. But the most important point about discretion is that the period is a maximum. The judge can impose a sentence of a week, a month, a year or two years. He would decide that on the gravity of the offence and all the circumstances surrounding it</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Government on stiffening up the provisions proposed under the previous Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and on taking on board the arguments that the deterrent value contained in that Bill was insufficient. It is therefore in no mood of carping criticism that I shall be supporting the amendment that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree completely that there is an unlimited fine available within the discretion of the courts that can be applied on those who fail to turn up having given their word through conditions of bail that they would so so. The circumstances which I adduced at the time of the proceedings on the previous Bill and daring the Second Reading debate on this Bill in the Scottish Grand Committee showed that it was clear that there were certain serious cases in which extradition proceedings might be necessary where witnesses and the courts had been disrupted severely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I cannot imagine that such a situation could ever meet with a penalty of more than one year. In certain circumstances a penalty of six months might be too low. This is a question of fine tuning and for a decision about what would be the appropriate penalties. I therefore agree
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
with the unlimited fine. I think that two years is too high and that a year as the suggested maximum might well be suitable. I congratulate the Government on taking the initiative and on having stiffened the penalties proposed in the previous measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am learning about the clause as I go along, to some extent. I keep seeing things in it that I have not previously appreciated. It is remarkable what one can do by re-reading a statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
Reading a statute!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Solicitor-General for Scotland, who is noted for his old-world courtesy in Committee, must give me the benefit of the doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that we have an accused on indictment in the sheriff court. He is granted bail on these conditions. The bail is that he turns up for his trial and there are other conditions attached to the bail. That is a situation which, presumably, will apply fairly commonly in future. The wretched or unfortunate man, depending on one's point of view, does not turn up for his trial. That is the first proposition. He will stand trial on the original offence once he has been caught. On that he can get up to two years because he is in the sheriff court. As the clause stands, he can be tried on a separate charge on indictment for failing to turn up for his trial. For that he can get another two years, giving a grand total of four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably—I am not too clear about this—there could be a further technical charge, although it is unlikely that it would happen, which is breach of the conditions. That could be taken in the High Court. There is a specific reference in clause 3(2) to the High Court. It puzzled me when I first saw it, but, presumably, it is to cover the kind of circumstances that I am now describing. Presumably he could get up to three months for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that is an extreme example but theoretically the accused could be given two years for the original offence, two years for the failure to turn up on indictment and three months on the summary complaint, which could be added, as often happens with summary complaints that are a tidying up matter. I should be interested if the Under-Secretary would confirm that theoretically that could happen, although it might be defeated by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
the good sense of the Crown Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the merits of the amendment, which also stands in my name, and which I am very glad has been supported by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), it is a matter of judgment, is it not? I should have thought that one year would be sufficient. I should have thought that the few occasions when more than one year was imposed would have been the subject of much adverse criticism which might do more to undermine than to strengthen respect for the law. I hope that the wish of the Solicitor-General for Scotland for blood, as one might say, may be overruled on this occasion by the civilised instincts of the Under-Secretary of State and that he will accept that one year is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly anxious to know whether there can be separate charges arising out of the same incident—the failure to turn up for trial and the breach of conditions—under subsections (2) and (3) and, therefore, whether there might be imposed a maximum sentence of two years and three months in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) re-reads each clause of the Bill, he obviously does a great service to the Committee in being able to bring before the Committee new matters which might not otherwise be before it. The hon. Member is quite right. There is no maximum number of conditions which the court might impose when granting bail. In theory, if they were to grant 40 conditions and the accused were to break every one of them, he might, in theory, end up by being sent away for a long time. But that is a rather extreme situation and I think that the hon. Member is correct in saying that the sense of the initial court when granting conditions and the common sense applied by the prosecuting authorities if conditions are breached would ensure that no ludicrous result came about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for moving the amendment, in so far as it gives an opportunity to indicate the Government's thinking on the matter. As my hon. Friend for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) correctly pointed out, the particular provision that allows imprisonment for up to two years to apply is relevant only in very limited circumstances.
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
It does not apply for any general breach of condition. It applies only for failure to appear at a diet of trial and, in any event, only at a diet of trial in solemn proceedings. So we are talking about very limited circumstances in which this two-year provision would even be available to the court if an accused absconded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is accepted by both sides of the Committee that where an accused who is appearing in solemn proceedings absconds and the trial that has been set cannot take place, it is a most serious matter. It is not only serious because of the trial being delayed but because of the enormous inconvenience caused to the witnesses, the jury, the court, and the public interest. The Committee will be grateful to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wislon) for originally suggestng that this was one section of the original Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill that could be usefully improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth suggested that the two-year period was too severe. In his arguments in favour of that proposition, he seemed to be implying that the maximum two years would be the sentence normally imposed when a person absconded. But one has to remind the hon. Member that this is a maximum sentence and the provision does not require a sentence of two years imprisonment to be imposed on every case where an accused person absconded, thereby preventing his trial from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the question is whether there are no circumstances in which a sentence of two years imprisonment would be more appropriate than one much more lenient. The figure of two years is not completely arbitrary, as the hon. Member will be aware. Two years, at the moment—subject to the comment of the hon. Member for Garscadden—is the maximum sentence for which the sheriff court on indictment can imprison a convicted person. It makes some sense, therefore, to relate one to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth asked what were the circumstances in which it might be rightly considered that a sentence of two years, far from being too severe, was the appropriate sentence. Many of the examples given simply relate to the convenience of the court and the expense and trouble that might be caused by an accused person absconding. I shall put one or two other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
examples to the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that a person, by absconding, by remaining out of contact with the court, was able to frustrate the interests of justice. It may be that one of the vital prosecution witnesses died during the period after which an accused person had absconded, and before he was apprehended. It may be that as a result, it was impossible to bring a successful prosecution against that accused person when he was apprehended again. In those circumstances, where an accused person, by absconding in solemn proceedings—a very serious matter—has, in effect, defeated the course of justice, or has, in effect, because the witness may have died during the course of his disappearance, enabled himself to be acquitted or not to be required to stand trial on the original charge, the court should be able to take a serious view of the matter. In those circumstances, would not a severe penalty be appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in those circumstances, if, at the trial, somebody has been found not guilty, the court should, in dealing with the absconding matter, make an assumption of guilt, had the original witness been available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not suggesting that for a moment. I am saying that it may not be possible for the trial ever to begin during the period that an accused person absconded. We must remember that the accused person will be guilty of an offence only if he has absconded or failed to turn up without reasonable excuse. If he has a reasonable excuse for not having appeared at a diet of trial, he is not guilty of an offence in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about circumstances—solemn proceedings—where an accused person has no reasonable excuse for not having turned up, and where, as a result of his having absconded without reasonable excuse, his trial on the original charge may not be able to proceed because witnesses may have died. I should have thought—and I do not think that this is an unreasonable proposition to make—that the court, when considering the appropriate sentence for an accused person who has absconded in order to defeat the ends of justice and has perhaps succeeded in that objective—not by being ultimately acquitted but by no criminal proceedings any longer being able to be brought—would
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
certainly be entitled, and would be correct in taking into account, that sort of consideration in determining what the appropriate sentence might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not the only examples. Let us assume another set of circumstances. Let us assume that the accused who absconded was one of a number of co-accused. Let us assume also that these were particular proceedings where either all the co-accused had to be tried jointly or it was not possible to bring criminal proceedings against any one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances by absconding without reasonable excuse, the interests of the other co-accused would be greatly limited, to their prejudice. They, who might wish to protest their innocence and who had reasonable hope of being acquitted, would not be able to have the matter considered until some weeks, months or, perhaps, years later when the accused who had absconded was ultimately apprehended and brought to trial. Again, in such circumstances, where the legitimate interests of co-accused might have been frustrated by the absconding accused person, is it not appropriate that this should be taken into account, and might not these be very serious matters which would merit not simply a very minor sentence of imprisonment but one up to the figure proposed in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier I had a great deal of sympathy with the clause as it stands, but I feel that the Under-Secretary may be extending the argument a little. In the serious cases he mentioned, presumably bail would not be granted if the matter were of very serious public concern, and the tariff of two years might not be appropriate in any event if proceedings were to be taken in the High Court. Secondly, under those circumstances, as at present, the bail that would have been granted would not reflect anything like the sanctions which now might be available under the clause if this measure is passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be confused. Of course he is correct in saying that if the court which originally considered the question of bail had thought that the accused would be likely to abscond it would not have granted bail in the first place. If that decision could always be taken without any fear of its being wrong, the problem would never arise. But we are envisaging a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
situation where a court took the view that bail was appropriate but the accused absconded. He absconded in solemn proceedings which, by definition, concern the more serious forms of alleged criminal activity. If he has absconded and by doing so has succeeded in preventing the normal course of justice from taking place, surely that is a circumstance which the Committee should take into account and one which the court would have to consider when determining the appropriate sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use again an example I have already given. If an accused person has achieved his desired end of not being able to be brought to trial because vital Crown witnesses have died, have disappeared, or have emigrated and will not come back, or because various other circumstances have resulted, that surely makes the appropriate sentence higher than would otherwise be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite apart from the specific justification of this sentence, would my hon. Friend not agree, as he seemed to indicate on Second Reading, that of importance also in this connection is the deterrent effect of such sentences to try to prevent the offender from absconding in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. This proposed maximum sentence permits a proper deterrent effect. I emphasise that this is a maximum sentence and not a minimum sentence or a statutory sentence that would have to be imposed. It is a maximum sentence that would be available in circumstances of the kind I have indicated. I emphasise that they are only examples, and no doubt there may be others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked whether the Government would give an estimate as to the likely effects on the prison population if this measure ended up on the statute book. If he thinks about it, he must know that it is utterly impossible for any estimate to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is answering a question he is posing himself. I did not ask that question at all. I asked whether the Government had considered the likely effect that this measure would have on the prison population. I know perfectly well that the hon. Gentleman cannot give that figure. He is
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
answering his own question, not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even on the version of the question that the hon. Gentleman now indicates he would like answered, I do not see the value of that sort of exercise. Clearly, neither the Government nor anyone else are aware of the number of people who will abscond. Even if the Government knew how many people would abscond, we should not be in a position to know the likely sentence to be imposed by the court when a person who had absconded appeared before it. In the absence of that information, to consider the effect on the prison population would be a somewhat meaningless exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are envisaging a situation where, despite the court having originally thought that bail was appropriate, an accused person does abscond, and, clearly, the number of cases in which a court might wish to impose the maximum sentence is likely to be very small. I cannot guarantee it; no one can do that. That is why the matter is left to the discretion of the courts, as always happens in matters of this kind. But on the basis of experience in other matters, I think it reasonable to assume that the courts do not normally impose the maximum sentence except when the circumstances clearly justify doing so. Obviously, the matter would be subject to appeal if a court exceeded what would be reasonable in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, taking into account all these aspects of the matter, I suggest that the maximum sentence of two years is sensible and appropriate. It meets the points that were raised by hon. Members. It allows the courts to take into account what might be the very severe consequences of an accused person who deliberately and without reasonable excuse absconds, not merely to the inconvenience of the court, but by doing so actually manages to prevent the normal course of justice taking effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our argument is simply that we are not against the unlimited fine. On balance, we are much more in favour of the court depending on the unlimited fine. Much of what the Under-Secretary of State said was based on the cost and inconvenience caused to the court, so it seems ridiculous, certainly in my opinion, to burden the taxpayer with further costs. After all, it costs £81 a week to keep a person in prison at present. When I asked the hon. Gentleman whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
he had given any consideration to the likely effect on prisons, and so on, I thought he would bring out the point that to keep a person in prison now costs £81 a week. So in future a court, having been put to cost and inconvenience, sentences a person to prison because it has been put to that cost and inconvenience, thereby, however, putting the cost and inconvenience of the additional year's sentence on to the taxpayer at a cost of about £4,500 per year per person.
