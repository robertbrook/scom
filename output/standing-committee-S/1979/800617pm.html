	<div class='title'>AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION ORDER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That clause 57, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up a point made by the Solicitor-General for Scotland, when he replied to the debate on clause 56 stand part. It was that people were already being fined, so there was no need to think that local authority social work departments would be overburdened by the new imposition on them of compensation orders, in that they had to take into account what the fine was and the person's ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the hon. and learned Gentleman expand a little on that matter? Presumably, for many offences, there is a range of fines that can be imposed, but there will be a statutory minimum that can be imposed at any time. No matter what the person's financial circumstances are, therefore, the court will have to impose at least that minimum fine on the offender. The court is also, however, fining not only on the basis of a person's circumstances—that is probably the last factor that it will take into account—but on the basis of the nature of the offence, on the value of the goods stolen if it is a theft and—if the court intends to continue a fine—on the basis of a person's previous conviction record in this respect. The person's financial circumstances will be, therefore, if not the last of all, certainly towards the end of the list. Many other matters have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says:
	<br><q><p>"the court shall take into consideration his means so far as known to the court."</p></q>
There is a clear indication there, which will be written into statute when we finish our deliberations, that a court "shall"—it does not say "may"—take into account the offender's means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1316</span>
If the system is to be fair, someone has to make an assessment of those means. In passing—to be honest, if I had spotted this point sooner I would have tabled an amendment—may I say that I do not like the term “his means". I think that “ability to pay" is a better way of phrasing it, for a person may appear to have means but not the ability to pay. He may have a high income but a large family, or large commitments in other respects, so that he cannot pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, someone has to undertake the consideration of that person’s means before the court can put a compensation order on him, because the court on its own, without investigation, cannot do it. If all that the court had before it was a simple statement of the person’s income, in terms of wage or salary, that does not take into account many other factors such as other sources of income that he may have, the outgoings that he has from his income and, therefore, his ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the compensation order is to be fair and is to mean something, it must be done, presumably, by the social work department which is qualified to make that type of investigation and to give a full report on the person’s means. Despite the remarks of the person’s means. Despite the remarks of the Solicitor-General for Scotland in our previous sitting, I believe that the consideration of a person’s means is an important factor that social work departments in the regional authorities will have to undertake. They are already overworked and have had added to their workload other commitments resulting from this legislation. This is yet another task that is being added to that workload. The Solicitor-General for Scotland should take that into account and the Government should say whether they are prepared to allow more money to be made available to regional authorities for social work departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I wish to make—my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) may expand on it in more detail—concerns subsection (2):
	<br><q><p>"In solemn proceedings there shall be no limit on the amount which may be awarded under a compensation order."</p></q>
I am worried that there “shall be no limit" to the amount awarded. A person could have enormous sums to pay out, for example, in the case of a theft of a valuable antique, which the solicitor-General for Scotland mentioned. If the antique has not been recovered and it can be proved that the person stole it, and if the antique
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1317</span>
were not insured—I shall come back to that point later—the person would have to pay the full amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the means of the person must be taken into account, but the court has only to "take into consideration" that person's means. The court does not have to limit the order in terms of his means. That is slightly different. Therefore, enormous amounts could be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dunpark report states that there should be a full investigation of the person's means, that the true value of the property should be determined, and that both should be put on a certificate signed by the court and given to the person. A procedure should be clearly laid out in the Bill saying how the process should be carried out, even in the solemn proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the reason is that in solemn proceedings limitations on fines are not there, as they are in summary proceedings, and that is why the legislation has been drafted in this way. However I and some of my hon. Friends feel that some clearly defined process should have been written into the Bill so that the accused or convicted person can understand the process in terms of the solemn proceedings, as the Dunpark committee suggested. We ought to take that way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland to answer those points concerning the workload on the social work depts. and the consideration of means, and to comment on how we could tighten up subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is very fond of telling the Committee what I shall discuss and expound on. In this Committee I am never very sure what I shall be allowed to expound on, nor am I sure whether these are the points on which I am particularly knowledgeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a crucial clause. Representations have been made to us to look at subsection (2). At this stage I merely ask "Does the subsection really mean what it says?" Does it mean that in solemn proceedings there should be no limit on the amount that may be awarded under a compensation order? Is there nothing whatever to restrict the power of a judge so that compensation of sums of five or six figures—or even nothing—may be awarded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be an extraordinary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1318</span>
proposition in the absence of guidelines. It could happen, in some kinds of fraud or embezzlement cases, that sums of that size could be involved. Even in such cases there would have to be taken into consideration the nature of the offence, the amount involved in the offence and the possibility of the guilty person finding that kind of money. It is extraordinary to provide for such a non-limit to be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has the figure of £200 been chosen in the district courts, in summary judgments, and so on? I do not know of any advice that refers to that figure. I hesitate to refer to the Dunpark report. I seem to remember that the figure previously discussed was £50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is that amount that has worried a number of the legal bodies concerned. They are concerned in two ways, first, because they do not feel that the courts are particularly equipped to make the proper kind of assessment; secondly, they are concerned that this is the method of making compensation at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society says that the proposals are impracticable. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The assessment and payment of reparation are much better dealt with by civil action."</p></q>
These provisions do not preclude civil action. I take it that a reparation or compensation order will not preclude civil action of one kind or another. However, compensation having been paid, it may alter the nature of the defence and the arguments that might take place in the course of a civil action. The difficulties are far too great for the judge and the facilities of the court properly and adequately to deal with the matter of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, quite apart from the amounts that might later be dealt with by civil action, the Law Society does not feel that the court is competent to make the kind of assessment that is necessary. It acknowledges the time given in most cases to ensure that they are properly assessed. Hence, the argument about the deferred sentence. The arguments that would ensue, possibly leading up to potential civil action, are related to the denial of the loss itself. These proceedings would certainly clog up the criminal jurisdiction and would be using the courts in a way in which they were never intended to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dunpark report lays down a procedure whereby this could be handled. On page 41 there is a procedure which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1319</span>
would enable this matter to be considered. I refer to the procedure of certification known as a compensation certificate. We should like to know why that was not introduced into this clause. The Government may have thought it to be an overcomplicated structure, but they are already bringing in a complicated structure, involving assessments, social work, circumstances, investigation, and so on. Why not go the whole hog and have this system with a compensation certificate which would, of course, allow the victim to table a full statement of his claim for compensation on which a convicting court could later make its assessment and grant its decision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are left with an extremely open-ended position on these solemn proceedings, that there should be no limit to the amount that could be considered and, even in the case of summary proceedings, it must now fall back on, presumably, some kind of social work to try to get some sense into the amount. It could lead finally to imprisonment if the amount were badly judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just the Law Society and the social workers who are concerned with this, but also the Glasgow Bar Association. It rejects the concept as being unrealistic. I do not agree with it. I think it is wrong, but I believe that the civil courts are the appropriate fora for assessment of damage, and that this would be imposing an unnecessary strain on the criminal court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the necessary guidelines, I do not see that that should necessarily be so, but we must accept that the association is right in asking the criminal courts to act in a quasi-civil capacity at the point of time—a phrase that I hate—of a criminal prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the problems and anxieties that we have regarding the clause—the failure to use a system whereby assessment could properly be done by the granting of a certificate; the failure of guidelines within the clause, with no indication that there will be later guidelines; the failure to have any kind of restrictions before a judge under solemn proceedings; and, finally, the problem that will create for a criminal court, designed for one purpose, having to make what has normally been an assessment by a civil action in relation to justice and fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be valuable if we understood
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1320</span>
how the Government saw the matter or, if they were having any sentencing policy discussions with the bench in the future, what kind of view they might be expressing in discussing those matters. We know that the compensation orders will have priority over the fine in relation to which gets the first three payments. I think that most of us would endorse that. It is a great self-sacrifice by the State, but it does not indicate what gets priority in relation to amounts. What kind of priority will be given to the level of compensation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the general points about which we are worried. I reiterate that certainly for myself and, in general, the Opposition approve of the general proposition enunciated in clauses 56 and 57, but I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said this morning. I do not think the Government have given the care and attention to thinking of the principles and difficulties involved, so that that which could have been a useful step forward—no more than that—has gone off pretty well at half-cock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned because the scale at which this will be applied—if we have the precedent of England and Wales to go by—could be fairly considerable. I was impressed by the figure of 71 per cent. which applies to England and Wales, because I see the rehabilitation elements involved as opposed to the punitive elements. But if that is the case, it makes our worries more and not less. I hope that we receive some answers on those points to see what consideration should be given to the passing or non-passing of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for my late arrival. As the Committee will see from the monitor, I was anxious to question the Secretary of State for Trade on his decisions and to ascertain that it will cost no more jobs in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to clause 57 stand part, the point I want to raise is, I suspect, something of the same point that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) raised—the part in subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) where
	<br><q><p>"a judge of a district court (other than such stipendiary magistrate) shall have power to make a compensation order awarding in respect of each offence an amount not exceeding £200."</p></q>
I turn again to the Dunpark committee report, because it recommended that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1321</span>
justices sitting in district courts should have discretion to award a compensation order only of an amount no greater than £30. The reasoning of the Dunpark committee was very sound. It considered that of all the courts in the judicial system it was most likely that the district court would make the most extensive use of the compensation orders. Indeed, evidence from England and Wales shows that it is the lower courts that are making the most extensive use of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dunpark argued—rightly, I think—in paragraph 8.07 on page 33 that it was wise to start at a very low level in giving discretion to the district courts, because it was they who would make or be expected to make the most extensive use of compensation orders, and that it was far better to start at a low level of £50 and, if necessary, to increase that figure at a later date. He argued strongly that if we started at too high a level—I consider £500 to be far too high—the possibility of error would be that much greater. While I know that under this Government we have had 22 per cent. inflation and that inflation is raging, the Government do not have to push everything up; they do not have to show us a badge of office. They have increased everything fourfold. We know that unemployment has increased fourfold. Inflation and costs are rising, and here, where they have an opportunity to hold costs down, they should take it and not go beyond the figure recommended by Dunpark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to find out from the Solicitor-General why it has been felt necessary to depart from the Dunpark committee recommendation on this aspect of reparation by the offender to the victim. How does he see the development of the use of this facility in the district courts? Does he agree with the Committee in its assertion that it will be used on a fairly extensive basis in the district courts, or does he, for some reason best known to himself, take the view that it might not be used so extensively?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly I should like to hear the figure of £200 justified. The report was published only in 1977. It is not wildly out of date— it is only 1½ to 3 years old now—and I do not accept that the intervening period has justified a fourfold increase in the recommendation of Dunpark when the report was published in 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree the principle but before we agree to the clause standing part of the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1322</span>
I hope that there will be some justification for the £200 figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the opportunity to answer the points made by hon. Members in, I think, genuine inquiry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised two matters. First, he asked why subsection (2) was unlimited in solemn procedure. Let us suppose that a multinational corporation were to be found guilty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As in Rhodesia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever ogre the hon. Gentleman takes, we have the example of a multinational corporation which may have defrauded individuals. Clearly, it is much more important that these people should be compensated rather than the multinational corporation made to pay thousands of pounds to the Treasury. Therefore, one could not limit the amount. There are innumerable cases of embezzlement, fraud or theft in which it may be appropriate to make the compensation order in which one says to them "Restore and we will consider forgiveness". I do not see that it would be possible to put a limit on such a figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland has, to some extent, missed my point although I can see his point, I was trying to explain, perhaps not clearly, that no schedule is laid down to show how the higher courts are to decide what the amount is and how exactly it shall be worked out in terms of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only answer the hon. Member by repeating what I said the other day—that nothing is more difficult than sentence. Into each case come a number of factors of differing weight and strength. The court has the impossible job—which I do not believe that anybody could do better—of attempting to assess the reward to the person who has been wounded, the ability of the person who has offended to pay, the appropriateness of the particular compensation order, the particular sentence, and the particular reasons why the person has offended in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large number of strands come into it and it calls for what is called judgment. That is why judges are called upon to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1323</span>
exercise it. I see no basis upon which, in solemn procedure, there could be a limit. The guidance is known to those who make judgment and they exercise that, taking into account all the factors concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points involved. First, the hon. and learned Gentleman is correct in assessing the difficulty of judgment and the number of strands that go into judgment. Some of the strands may run contrary to the assessment judgment, in other words, the nature of the offence or the nature of the offender, as well as the amount which the victim, on a single argument of compensation, might be awarded. It seems difficult to get justice in that kind of assessment because of all the other strands put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. and learned Gentleman refers to sums which he says must be unlimited because we may be dealing with a five-figures-plus situation. Surely that matter would be more appropriate for civil action, or some other action, rather than a judge using it as part of his sentencing policy. Those are the two things that worry me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that it comes strangely to the ears of those on the Conservative Benches who are lawyers that the Opposition favour civil action. If one takes as an example the criminal injuries compensation board, there was almost no civil action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Injury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Injury, yes, but injury by persons who might have paid. There was no civil action because it is such an abstruse, uncertain and expensive concept that persons do not undertake it. Even in cases of fraud or embezzlement or where people have made a great deal of money by simple, long, firm frauds, there is no civil action because of the uncertainty, unlikelihood and expense of such a procedure. Therefore, I do not believe that civil action is a real remedy for a person who has been wounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to be able to help the victim— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It does not matter whether it is a multinational. I could mention innumerable cases where it would have been competent to raise a civil action,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1324</span>
and where the person against whom it would have been raised had funds which could have been paid, but if the injured party had asked me "Should I raise a civil action—the person has been convicted of an offence, would I succeed?"I would say to him "I advise you to go home, lick your wounds, and forget it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.00 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for Scotland for giving way again. I intended to ask later how, during the proceedings of any court, whether it be solemn or summary proceedings, the court makes an assessment of the extent of damage. If the property is stolen, the assessment is easy. One gets the value of the stolen property, although there may be some problems. But in the case of personal injury that is difficult. In civil proceedings one would call medical evidence to adduce that the person is not medically fit, therefore, there would be grounds for compensation in a variety of different ways. During a criminal trial, how does the judge make an assessment of what compensation ought to be made available without any skilled evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid it is an imperfect world. I take it that it would be done in a similar way to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. It may have medical evidence, if it is a medical case. It is unlikely that there would be a great number of cases in which there are personal injuries in which that compensation order would be used as a form of 	<i>salatium.</i> Let us suppose that a person had been convicted of indecent assault on a girl and had paid out £50. I do not see the compensation order as being used as a civil action to provide 	<i>solatium.</i> Therefore, I do not see that that matter arises.

The court will come to its judgment. That judgment will be based on all the factors intertwining. It may not be an actuarial system, but even actuaries— although they are in the highest paid profession—get things wrong. It is subject to human fallibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked why the compensation order awarded in a district court should not exceed £200. The answer is that at the time the Dunpark committee recommended £50, the maximum fine was £100. The maximum fine is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1325</span>
now £200, and the reason why we selected the figure is that it is the same as the maximum fine. Oddly enough, in England the amount is £400 in the magistrates' court. That has not been the subject of abuse. Maxima do not do a great deal of harm. I have just been advised that I have misadvised the hon. Member, and that the maximum fine in England has been raised to £1,000 since 1973. So I do not think that £200 in Scotland is excessive. We are not five times poorer—perhaps meaner, but not poorer—than those in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter raised by the hon. Member was the priority of compensation. How can one say that the fine will get this or the compensation will get that? I am sure that if a court considers that a compensation order is appropriate, it will give full compensation. Let us say that a victim has suffered a loss of £100. The court will say the victim has to be paid £100. If the court considers that the appropriate penalty would have been a fine of £200, it will then award an additional fine. I can conceive of no circumstance in which a court, if it thought a compensation order was right, would say "Well, £150 is right. Some has to go to fines and some to compensation, so we shall give £75 to each."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the court thought it appropriate, it would not satisfy the compensation order in full before it considered the imposition of any fine in addition, and that would be considered only if the amount of damage done was not a sufficient penalty for the evil that was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, as I have said before in the Committee, when someone breaks into an old person's home and steals an article of little value, that may make that person feel that his home will never be his home again. He may feel in fear for ever. The object taken might be a pen valued at £2, which might mean that a compensation order for £2 was made. But clearly that would not be sufficient penalty. It is only in such circumstances that I can see that a fine would be added to the compensation order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there might be other examples. Surely, when a person had stolen an article of no great significance from a public place—not an article such as that in the example given by the Solicitor-General for Scotland but, say, a raincoat— and its value was small in the sense that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1326</span>
compensation order would be small, but the person has a fairly long record of conviction, the court would not want to imprison the person because of the value of the article but might wish to impose a heavy fine as a deterrent to him because he has a long record of conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That is another example. I trust that the raincoat given in that example from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was not the one he had when he was stopped for his briefcase to be searched. Otherwise he might have to pay the compensation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can conceive of many cases in which the compensation or the damage done would not be sufficient an indication of the seriousness of the material damage. There would be many cases in which the compensatory amount would be insufficient to indicate the appropriate punishment and, therefore, one would get a combination.

There seems to be some weakness in the Bill as it stands. I believe that to some extent the Solicitor-General for Scotland admitted that by saying that it was not a perfect world and that therefore we would have to put up with imperfections. It is not clear exactly how the evaluation of the damage done or the property stolen will be carried out, or who will do it, so that the court may take it into account in terms of paying compensation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, certainly not.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused about subsection (2):
	<br><q><p>"Only the court shall have power to enforce a compensation order."</p></q>
What is the necessity for subsection (2)? What alternative is there to the court? Apparently we are not entitled to discuss under this how it is to be done and who is to make the assessment, because that should have been done under the amount. I must admit that I was equally confused on that and thought that we could examine it. Who other than the court could do it? Clearly it will not be the social work department, the probation officer, the supervisory people of one kind or another. Payment will be made to the clerk of the court. What happens if the chap does not turn up weekly or fortnightly or with the lump sum to pay it? How is the power exercised? What do they do to bring it about? Does this give a new power of enforcement to court officials? Will it not again lead to the problem previously raised of the work load now being undertaken by the court officials? I understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1328</span>
that the extra money for this has not been included in the financial resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two things are involved. One is that the officials of the court would be undertaking a task for which they are not primarily equipped. Certainly we know that they are not equipped to deal with assessment. Secondly, there is a problem of the numbers involved. It all becomes difficult if we do not use a system such as—and I hesitate to mention it—is described in the Dunpark report concerning certification and the delay in putting in an organisation to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confused, because as it stands subsection (1) means that only the courts have that power. It is now asserted, and even as asserted it seems to pose problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a quibble with only one word. Will the Solicitor-General, with his grasp of language, comment on it? "Should" rather than "shall" is used. Is there a significance in that? Is "should" less mandatory than "shall" in this case, and, if so, why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first thank the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for his gracious acceptance of this matter? It seems to me absolutely correct that, where punishment can be combined with compensation, that should take priority over punishment for its own sake. I think, therefore, that all members of the Committee agree that it is a sensible principle, where one can do good and evil at the same time to do good and evil rather than evil on its own. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) does not understand the meaning of "good".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and the meaning of evil too. However, may I take clauses 59 and 60 together, for the sake of argument rather than discussion, and with your permission, Mr. Gourlay? My understanding is that clause 60 deals with the case where a person has both been fined and had a compensation order made against him, but that it is implicit in clause 59 that, although the court might consider both making a compensation order and fining him, it will not just fine him. If I am wrong I do not see why we need both clauses. Will the Solicitor-General confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, may I try to pick up the intervention? I believe that the point at issue relates to clause 60 which reads:
	<br><q><p>"Where a convicted person hss both been fined and had a compensation order made against him".</p></q>
Clause 59 clearly cannot refer to that case. It must, therefore, mean "where it would be appropriate either to impose a fine or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1330</span>
to make a compensation order", otherwise there is no need for the separate clause. Have I got it right? I understand the concept of clause 59 to be that where it would be appropriate for compensation to be, say, £200 and the fine £100, but the defendant could afford a total of only £200, the fine would be waived. The compensation would not be reduced. Is that what it means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am horrified to say that the mathematical genius of the hon. Members for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) had me lost, but let me see whether I can explain the matter in my own simple way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 59 if the court takes the view that the person could afford, say, £100, and if the loss to the victim is £100, the court should prefer the compensation order. But the court may not be satisfied that the loss to the victim was £100. It may take the view that the victim has recovered the money from his insurance company and that, if a compensation order were made, he would be given a present of £100, because—I believe I am right in saying this, but if anyone wishes to pay me a fee for saying it, I shall look it up—in law one would not be under any but a moral obligation to repay that sum to one's insurance company if it had already paid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "should", therefore, is intended to give an indication to the court of the preference. If "shall" were used, as the hon. Member for Garscadden suggested—I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon; the ghost of Garscadden is so often with me that perhaps I occasionally attribute it to Banquo as well as to Duncan. Lady Macbeth is writing with her left hand. I should have referred to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). It is important that there should be an indication that the compensation order as an alternative is preferable, but there may be circumstances in which the fine is appropriate. That is the reason for "should" rather than "shall" in clause 59.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I should be in order in discussing clause 60 at present, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the difference between "should" and "shall". It has been perfectly well explained by the Solicitor-General. I do not understand the difference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1331</span>
between "preference" and "precedence", apart from their being equally difficult for me to say. "Preference", in clause 59, seems to imply that only one should be chosen and, therefore, that there will not be both a compensation order and a fine. If there are both, clause 60 comes into play with "precedence". But, if one is preferred to another, one is singled out and the other is not taken. If one takes precedence one is put above the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in my view my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) takes precedence over my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). That is taking account of both of them. If K say that I prefer one of them to the other, I am singling him out. It is difficult, but I am assuming that clause 59 implies that there will be no fine and that, even if a fine were considered appropriate, the compensation order should take preference over it because the court must take account of the means of the convicted person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is right. The clause should make what he says explicit, but it is a bit obscure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is right. The clause is almost explicit, but a bit obscure. Perhaps we could look at the wording on Report to make it quite clear that the maximum amount that a person could pay would be subsumed by the amount which should be paid in compensation. No fine is then involved as it has all been paid in compensation, by preference. Can that be clarified? I believe that it is explicit, but it is still explicitly ambiguous. Perhaps it could be improved on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is becoming "multiplicit" and that perhaps is one of the arguments advanced in lengthy legislation. We have had an argument over the shortest sentence in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the sheriff decides: "The appropriate penalty for this offence is £120. The victim lost a tape recorder valued at £80, so I order you to repay the victim £80. I will fine you £40." That is how the court would work. It would consider the appropriate penalty. It would then consider the appropriate compensation and whether compensation was appropriate. If it felt that the payment of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1332</span>
compensation was insufficient punishment, it would fine. That is the order in which it should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, the court discovered that the person had had the tape recorder returned in perfect working order it might decide that compensation would not be appropriate, so a fine would be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens if the court does not discover that the tape recorder has been returned until after the compensation order has been made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then, as in life, luck plays its part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to return to this matter, but the Solicitor-General for Scotland has thrown a different light on it. Up to now I had presumed that the clause said that if the appropriate punishment should be £100 and the judge thought compensation of £100 was desirable, he would not impose a fine of £100, but would award the compensation. Is that correct?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if the appropriate punishment was £100 and £60 was the amount of compensation, that would leave £40 for a fine. The judge may realise that a £40 fine was not adequate punishment but because we are giving preference to the compensation order he would make the fine of £40 the secondary amount. The £60 would be paid by way of compensation. So clause 59 covers both factors— a fine and compensation. Have I expressed that clearly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member as a good Socialist may be horrified, but all that the clause means is that if the judge has to decide whether the State or the individual gets the lolly, the individual has preference over the State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I have got it now. Someone has asked for me on the telephone but this is so interesting that I am staying. Clause 59 deals with the case when the judge is about to sentence but clause 60 is about the collection of the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General has foxed the issue again by the apparent simplicity of saying that it is a question of who gets the lolly—the State or the victim. He says it is the victim, but I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1333</span>
thought that he had already agreed that there could be a situation in which both got it, and if both got it, the proportion paid in compensation should be the proportion that is justified for compensation purposes, however little is left for the fine. Thus, in fact, its apparent simplicity puts the clause in error and I think that I have it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has it right but let me give a simple example. The judge takes the view that £200 is the appropriate penalty. If the chap concerned has only £100 and the tape recorder is worth £100, he gives all the money to the victim. If on the other hand, the chap has £150, he gives £100 to the victim and £50 for the fine. If he has £200, he gives £100 to the victim and £100 for the fine. Surely that is fairly simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPEALS AS REGARDS COMPENSATION ORDER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief question to pose in relation to subsection (2). We are all agreed that for the purposes of any appeal or review a compensation order is regarded as a sentence, but subsection (2) states
	<br><q><p>"Where a compensation order has been made against a person, a payment made to the court in respect of the order shall be retained until the determination of any appeal in relation to the order."</p></q>
In what situation does the Solicitor-General see a position prevailing where someone had already made an instalment payment towards the compensation and then decided to appeal? I have some worry here. It comes back to the point made by my hon. Friend about the recovered tape recorder and his other remarks, and I wonder whether the Solicitor-General can give one or two examples. Clearly, in the case of criminal appeals, notices of appeal are given within, I think, seven days— certainly there is a time limit in which to lodge an appeal. I assume that the same appeal provisions will prevail in this case, that there will be a time limit within which the appeal must be lodged. Therefore, would it not be wise to delay the first payment on a compensation order if there is any question of the possibility of an appeal, until the short time limit has elapsed and until it is known whether an appeal is to be lodged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) but that is not the case with a fine, nor with imprisonment, although there may be bail pending appeal. In ordinary circumstances one serves the period of imprisonment until the appeal occurs, and it is common for a person to pay a fine at the bar, to produce the notes from his pocket and hand them over. I do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1335</span>
not think it would be appropriate to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, there might be a situation in which a person committed a statutory offence which gave rise to a compensation order and it was then realised by his solicitor that there was a statutory defect in the charge, complaint, or whatever. Obviously, if one were to delay it until there was an appeal, a further process would be required to collect, which would be expensive. If one were to hand the money back during an appeal, one would have the same difficulty. If we consider that there will be cases in which the person will be reluctant to pay, or will not pay, or pretend he cannot pay, it will be appreciated that once a person has handed over the funds he will get them back if the appeal is successful. But to hand them back in the meantime or to delay payment of them would encourage bogus appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one has an overdraft which we on the Conservative Benches have, and which those in credit and capital on the Labour Benches do not understand, at current rates of interest there is a benefit in even £10 being in one's pocket for another six weeks. Therefore, people would appeal. It might involve a large sum of money. We might be dealing with a corporation which has been given a compensation order of £500,000 and it would be marvellous to appeal in order to keep £500,000 in the bank for six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in all cases, big and small, I think it would be unrealistic to follow the hon. Gentleman's suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point on that. But there is also the reverse argument. If a multinational corporation or a public body—it is possible that a public body could be fined or a compensation order made against it for a criminal act—and it has to put down £500,000, it would, as the Solicitor-General for Scotland suggested, like to keep its money in its pocket. The appeal could last for a considerable time presumably, if it was a complicated fraud case, and that sum of money could be tied up for a long time, but if at the end of the day the judgment of the court was overturned by the appeal and the body was found innocent, what compensation would that corporation receive for the interest lost during that time? Will it be given back the money, plus interest, as happens nowadays when the income tax authorities make mistakes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1336</span>
I profess genuine ignorance on this, but would a person who is sentenced to a compensation order be able to appeal against the amount of that compensation order? Would that be an appeal? I will give a reasonably wild extreme. A person has assaulted somebody. A compensation order is given for £1,000 because the victim has claimed that he is unfit for work, will remain so for a number of weeks or months and produces a doctor's certificate to prove it. Two days after the trial the convicted person sees the victim—who may be a workmate—back at work doing his job and receiving full pay. In that circumstance would he be entitled to appeal against a compensation order laid upon him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "Yes". For the purposes of any appeal or review, a compensation order is a sentence and any sentence may be varied.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have rooted objection to acts of adjournal as methods of procedure. Am I right in saying that there is no discussion and no debate in relation to an act of adjournal? It is a curious process whereby a non-elected but highly educated and appointed body of legal people draws up an act of adjournal to put into practice the ground rules of laws which Parliament passes. Have I got right the structure of an act of adjournal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Transport and General Workers' Union and the ASTMS can make their own internal rules as to the sensible running of their organisations. Although the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice-General and the Lord- Justice

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1337</span>
Clerk cannot appoint themselves for life, they are entitled to make sensible rules by act of adjournal for the operation of Acts of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Transport and General Workers' Union and the ASTMS make their internal rules they have to submit them to the registrar for approval. That is not true of acts of adjournal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point. The rules those unions make are subject to annual conferences of the rank and file. From what the Solicitor-General for Scotland has been saying about the Law Society and the bar association, the last thing that the hon. and learned Gentleman wants is an annual conference to decide on the hierarchical methods and practices of those who prepare an act of adjournal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a twentieth century legal monstrosity. If it is a matter merely for the wellbeing and protective wellbeing of the members it is time we looked at it. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that it is analogous to trade unions which join together to defend their interests, there are enough legal bodies defending their own interests—the Faculty of Advocates, the Law Society and the bar association. But acts of adjournal are not for that purpose. They are not to deal with the wellbeing and the circumstances of lawyers: they are to deal with the application of the law to individuals in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly appropriate to discuss in this debate the methods in which the whole of this part of the Bill should be applied. Two hon. Members were faulted, quite properly, because they thought they could discuss the matter under clause 58, which they could not. These are the matters which, presumably, the acts of adjournal shall include: They
	<br><q><p>"shall include power to make rules with regard to any of the provisions of this Part of this Act, including rules relating to the award and payment, by compensation orders, of sums to persons under any legal disability."</p></q>
It is into these acts of adjournal that the structures and methods and application of these clauses will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does anything that we say in this Committee affect what goes into the acts of adjournal? If we were to say that we want to seek in an act of adjournal the question of the background analysis of the nature of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1338</span>
the people involved, the involvement of social workers or the tholing of assize and imprisonment, can any compensatory order then be deferred? All these manifold problems that arise in the application of this provision were dealt—almost not dealt —with in the preceding clauses. Am I right in saying that all these things can be put into an act of adjournal and, more important, am I in order in saying that we can say here what we think should be in an act of adjournal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was concerned about the kind of people who should be involved. My hon. Friend has a bad habit of saying "I am about to declare on certain matters". He was offended when we leapfrogged over clause 57 and went on to clause 58. We now have an opportunity to discuss the kind of things that will go into this act of adjournal. Will it determine the people involved? Will it say that sheriff-clerks will employ people or send for a social worker? Will it do all the things that social workers are so rightly concerned about? Will it do what the Dunpark report said should be done, in relation to establishing—if not in practice, at least in form —some kind of procedure involving certification of the ability of the verdict to come forward with some kind of assessment for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of guidance will be given to the sheriff when he makes the decision into which go the manifold strands of judgment on the nature of the offence, the nature of the offender, the problem of financial loss as opposed to that of personal loss, the best place to put someone who is sentenced to imprisonment and on the award of a compensatory order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a great flow of reasons as to why the judges of Scotland are the people best qualified to make such a judgment and that would, by its nature, almost debar them from making such a judgment in relation to compensation. Will they be able to say such things as the hon. and learned Member raised when he spoke of the possibility of a compensation order of £500,000 if a multinational company were involved. What will the act of adjournal say that will determine how a judge should decide that amount, short of putting in a team of accountants to sort out that assessment? Could that be put in an act of adjournal? There is nothing here about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1339</span>
accountants being pulled in under clause 57 which says that
	<br><q><p>"in solemn proceedings there shall be no limit on the amount…"</p></q>
Yet this act of adjournal is to be passed by this non-elected legal body of the hierarchy of the profession. It will all be done without our having paid attention to it. I ask again whether what we say here matters. Does he really mean that it is possible for a judgment in a compensation case to determine a compensation of the order of £500,000?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social workers cannot help in that respect nor can the court officers give useful advice. The defence counsel is almost debarred from giving that kind of advice about his client. Only his accountant would know a client's means. What will be put into the Act of Adjournal to say that this should be done? This aspect should have been spelled out not in an act of adjournal, but in the Bill. It might be useful if the Solicitor-General for Scotland could tell us at this stage the kind of things that the act of adjournal will decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having allowed the hon. Gentleman to go rather wide on this aspect, I shall indicate that the act of adjournal is already a procedure under the 1975 Act. It does not fall within the purview of this Committee. This clause merely extends the powers that are contained in the 1975 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Does that mean that we can make points as to whether that part of the Act should be covered by an act of adjournal rather than by this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, hon. Gentlemen can certainly do that. They cannot attempt to amend the clause at this stage. We are merely discussing whether we should leave the clause in the Bill or exclude it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once more, we owe a great debt to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for raising an issue. You have rightly pointed us, Mr. Gourlay, in the direction that we should be moving—whether the provisions in the Bill should allow the power to be given to the High Court to deal with the acts of adjournal. My hon. Friend has raised some important points. Even though previous Acts enacted by whatever Government for whatever reason, gave the power to the High Courts to deal with the acts of adjournal, it is open to us to question at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1340</span>
any time, whether that is an appropriate way to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest there be any misunderstanding from those who do not understand English, Latin or law, I advise the Committee that, with regard to civil procedure, the Court of Session in the person of the Lords—the Senate of justice—has power to pass acts of sederunt. With regard to criminal procedure, the Lords in senate have power to pass acts of adjournal. This is entirely to do with procedure. It has nothing to do with legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I think I am right in saying that the judges who deal with the question in criminal matters are the same persons, in different guises, as those who deal with the criminal justice. Is it appropriate for those people to deal with such matters? The Solicitor-General said, quite rightly, that these are procedural matters, rules and regulations. But they are procedural matters, rules and regulations that affect the lives of our constituents. They are matters which impinge on public policy. They are matters of public interest. I think that I raised this point on Second Reading of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which seems to have bitten the dust for one reason or another. I asked then about the appropriateness of the High Court judges for dealing with such problems—problems that affect our constituents. If one considers where the High Court judges come from—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not speak too disrespectfully about them. After all, half of them were Socialist Members of Parliament previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not say much —so were Richard Marsh, George Brown, the right hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Prentice), Jim Sillars and look what has happened to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason that the other half were not Tory Members of Parliament is that they were not elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People who find their way into the judiciary tend to be from Scottish private schools such as the Edinburgh Academy and Merchiston Castle. Such judges went to Scottish private schools and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1341</span>
they know little of the background of the people with whom they are dealing. I find that these senators of the college of justice, —these High Court judges—have a very sparse background knowledge and understanding of the problems that we are dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The name of Lord Braxfield was taken as an example of the worst type of judge one could get. He had the benefit of being at a State comprehensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much doubt whether, at that time, there was a State comprehensive school in the sense that we understand it today. Even judges who went to Aberdeen grammar school and Dunfermline high school—and to their credit I understand that there are those who made it up the ladder in spite of that relatively humble but very good education —when they became judges tend to go out of touch with what is happening in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They do not seem to be the appropriate people to deal with it. They do not walk down the streets of Pilton or Easterhouse or Dalmellington. They do not understand the problems that we have to deal with. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has raised a serious problem and I hope that we shall give serious consideration to whether it is appropriate for such important matters as the acts of adjournal to be dealt with in such an academic, high-flown, ivory-tower kind of way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stick carefully to the wording of the clause, because I have seen you, Mr. Gourlay, on one or two occasions moving nearer to the edge of your chair during the previous speech. The clause says
	<br><q><p>"shall include power to make rules with regard to any of the provisions of this Part of this Act."</p></q>
I have grave reservations about that in terms of acts of adjournal. I hope that the Solicitor-General will not prolong the debate—as is his wont and has been his wont throughout the Committee—by making what he considers to be the clever, snide remark, which only provokes us further to our feet, instead of getting on with the debate. If he will now give some sensible answers, instead of making wisecracks about trade unions, we might get on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1342</span>
better. I do not know whether his hon. Friends are agreeing with me or are just having a general tattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do these rules include such things as how an assessment of the amount of compensation in terms of an injury to a person is to be made? Will an act of adjournal lay down that a court, in taking an injury purpose, must have, say, a medical certificate saying what loss of working time there will be, whether the injury will be permanent, and what the monetary loss might be? Will all this be done under rules under the act of adjournal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If so, I join my hon. Friend in his severe reservations about giving power under this Bill to an unelected body, not responsible to this House, to make rules on a variety of things when we introduce a new procedure of this nature. I am not worried about their existing powers, although I would have reservations about them. It surely would have been in order for the Solicitor-General and the Government to introduce a schedule to the Bill which would have done exactly the job which the High Court's power to make an act of adjournal can do. If that had been done we would have been able to go through it in Committee and examine it in detail. We shall not have that opportunity if it is done under the act of adjournal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how my hon. Friends feel—I shall discuss it with them—but I have grave reservations about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Solicitor-General will confirm that it is not the intention through acts of adjournal to lay down guidelines as to the way that compensation should be assessed. I am glad that the Solicitor-General seems to be moving his head in assent at that statement, because I hope that we shall not have any of this nonsense of guidelines being laid down. As we have said so often throughout the Bill, it is difficult to work in generalities in this field. We always have to work in specifics, and circumstances will differ almost from caes to case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 282 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 is merely an adminisstrative section and under that section there would be no question of the court being able to make any rules which would, for instance, affect a prison officer or a governor of a prison. There would be no question of a court being able to make any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1343</span>
rules and I suspect that that is why clause 64 is in the Bill in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is precisely the problem which I was hoping to speak on. My hon. Friend is right. Section 282 makes the exception relating to prison officers or governors that nothing shall be done by any such act of adjournal except with the consent of the Secretary of State. Clearly, there is no such exception made here in relation to behaviour of court officers in the operation of this section. In other words, in the basic provision to which clause 63 refers, they recognise and make exception for aspects where it should not be covered, but there is no such exception made to deal with any aspects of this part here. That seems to me a very crucial point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I have no doubt that there is a crucial point here. I sometimes think that the public would be astonished if it knew the powers that lay within the courts for determining not only the rules but a great many other things that affect the working of courts. Obviously, I would not want to go into that at this stage, but there is a need for a more open debate about the way in which the courts set their rules and procedures and so on. I do not think it sufficient for Members of Parliament just to defend them by saying "Well, that is acts of adjournal procedure."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that sections 282 and particularly section 457 would merely facilitate the drafting of the new forms that will be necessary for the implementation of this part of the Act. The reparation by the offender is a new concept in Scots criminal law. In order to start this more open approach that we would all hope for in relation to how the courts administer their affairs, it would be very helpful if the Solicitor-General for Scotland were to indicate to the Committee that he would encourage either the Lord Justice-General or the Lord President, or whoever is responsible for these acts of adjournal, to make available their various acts of adjournal that are made under this section. I am not suggesting that we should go back to the beginning of legal history, but to facilitate a much wider awareness of what happens inside the courts it would be a good idea if the Solicitor-General for Scotland were to agree to encourage both or one of those learned gentlemen to make the acts of adjournal in the Library. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1344</span>
could then see exactly what the courts have decided in relation to part IV.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). The Lord Justice-General and the Lord President are the same person, wearing different clothes. With respect, I think he meant the Lord Justice-Clerk, because the Lord President could only make acts of sederunt. At the risk of tempting providence, perhaps I could further advise the hon. Member that all the acts of adjournal are in the Library which can be consulted by hon. Members at any time. I am slightly dismayed but I doubt whether any of those who have spoken have ever consulted any of the 2,000 odd Acts of Adjournal which are in the Library. If they had done so, perhaps they would not be quite so anxious because the acts are purely procedural. I am able to advise the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that there is no question of trying to push judges one way or the other about what they will or will not consider, because, as the hon. Gentleman has so rightly said, it will vary from case to case with such magnitude and weight of emphasis that to lay down anything that might fit in with the awful word "guideline" would be manifestly inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last words of the clause, "sums to persons under any legal disability", do not refer to people in prison, but to three-year-olds or 14-year-olds or mental defectives— persons without full legal capacity. Clearly, the senate must lay down what the clerk of court is to do with the funds. For example, is he to pay them to a three-year-old mental defective? It is the rules of procedure for what the officials of the court do in the mechanism of operating the legislation that acts of adjournal are about. That is their function. That is their purpose. They are laid down in section 282, for solemn procedure, and section 457, for summary procedure, in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. They are, so to speak, the rule book for the implementation of legislation for the officials who have to legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause quite clearly states "including". It does not say that the clause is about persons under any legal liability. They are merely included as a part of it, not as a whole. That was the point I wanted to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1345</span>
May I also ask whether these rules can include how one makes an assessment for a compensation order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. They cannot and would not include that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is it to be done then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, may I say that there are certain trusts and precedents in all professions. The precedence of an act of adjournal is well known. It is laid down in law. I do not at the moment foresee any risk that there is likely to be a Lord Justice-General in Scotland who will seize the Crown, put it on his head and start to try to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the rules of procedure which have been consistently laid down by the court. One matter to which I presume they would have to be addresses is what would happen if the clerk of court is paid the sum of a compensation order and the party to whom it is due dies before it can be paid to him. What time is to be allowed for payment? What is the time of notice? The 	<i>induciae</i> and all the small detail of the application of these matters is laid down by an act of adjournal. An act will not say "Compensate people over 6 ft tall who went to English schools and represent West of Scotland seats, but do not compensate the rest." There is no risk of any policy matter. An act of adjournal contains only the rules of procedure. I am quite certain that if any senate were to exceed that it would be doing so unintentionally, because senates are most careful of the safeguards of the integrity of that procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that when a senator assumes office he is required to take an oath in relation to the discharge of his duties, and that that oath broadly encompasses the safeguards to which my hon. and learned Friend has referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is indeed required to take two oaths, of which that is one. I know of no person who has discharged the office of senator of the College of Justice—sitting in this matter, of course, as a college—who has ever attempted to frustrate the purpose of the Acts of Adjournal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1346</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not that we suspect that they will try to frustrate the purpose of this provision. We are concerned about the procedure to be followed —even such decisions as to where the money goes if someone dies. This is a major matter. Lawyers have made fortunes out of the problem of where money goes in certain circumstances. The Solicitor-General's very example raises a highly important matter of principle. He talked airily about there being no limit to compensation on solemn procedures—£½ million in the case of a multinational. I should like to see the case there if it is only the Act of Adjournal that has determined such a major matter. It is no longer one of procedure; it concerns major matters of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1975 parent Act says that the High Court may
	<br><q><p>"regulate the practice and procedure in relation to solemn criminal procedure under any enactment including this Part of this Act."</p></q>
Clause 63 adheres to this particular Act of Adjournal, and I am exemplifying on it. The Act continues:
	<br><q><p>"provided that no rule, regulation or provision which affects the governor or any other officer of a prison shall be made by any such Act of Adjournal except with the consent of the Secretary of State."</p></q>
I emphasise the recognition in this clause establishing the Act of Adjournal. Even within the clause establishing the Act of Adjournal in relation to criminal procedure it was said "Here is a point where we have to make specific reference to it and handle it in a particular way." To the criminal procedures we have now attached a matter which, while it is a part of criminal procedure, raises another issue altogether, namely, the area of compensation for an offence, and not only that area but the area of compensation for an offence to be paid by the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If aspects affecting the prison were seen as an exception here—and other exceptions may have been necessary—clearly, particular problems arise for which no exceptions are made. In fact, the clause says:
	<br><q><p>"including rules relating to … sums to persons under any legal disability."</p></q>
That exception has been made in the clause. Therefore, on matters well beyond minor procedural matters involved, we find the whole of part IV unsatisfactory in the sense of spelling out how this will be carried
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1347</span>
out. The Dunpark committee made certain suggestions which have been ignored, if I may say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall vote against the clause for two reasons. I think that procedural matters can affect the operation of justice. What the courts may see in their exalted senatorial positions as purely procedural matters may affect Johnny Smith on the ground when applied. We are not just dealing with criminal procedures eventually decided by a sheriff passing a sentence but with criminal procedures decided by a sheriff in relation to actual compensation—a different matter altogether from criminal problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against the clause for that reason. I shall also ask them to vote against the clause for a second reason. For too long we have allowed this kind of block insertion in legislation in relation to Acts of Adjournal without challenging them. So far as I know, this is the first time that it has been challenged and I intend to pursue my challenge to the utmost. There are 2,000 Acts of Adjournal. The reason that we have had no problems with them is because the courts have assumed that they should operate in this way, and they go on operating in this way. That is the procedure, nobody challenges it; that is the way it works and we have become accustomed to that. That is why it has not been challenged. If it were an Act of Parliament people would be writing to their MPs asking why that Act of Parliament was not changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future such powers should be spelt out—their aims, purposes and methods, and in this case, and in some others, the people involved—to guide the noble senators in their thinking. It should be suggested to them that in preparation of such an Act of Adjournal they should</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 314, in page 45, leave out lines 30 to 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will see, the amendment is tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), whose presence we have all greatly missed today. We look forward to welcoming my hon. Friend home for Thursday morning's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I openly admit that this is a probing amendment. We are anxious to find out how the Solicitor-General sees the provision contained in lines 30 to 42 before we reach a conclusion on whether we ought to press the amendment further. I admit, too, that my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden—as was clear to the Committee in the debate on clause 49— has an inherent dislike of imprisonment in lieu of fines, particularly when the fine is below £50. There was an interesting and important debate between the Under-Secretary of State and my hon. Friend on clause 49.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) provides that
	<br><q><p>"a court may impose imprisonment in respect of a fine and decline to impose imprisonment in respect of a compensation order but not 	<i>vice versa</i>".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1351</span>
A temptation will prevail in that situation. Subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) says that the court can impose a prison sentence in lieu of both the fine and the compensation order but not the compensation order only. It can impose a sentence of imprisonment in default of paying a fine only, but not a compensation order only, or the court can impose a prison sentence in respect of default in paying both the fine and the compensation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the table of sentences passed in clause 49 is that which will apply in this part of the Bill. For the purpose of the debate only, I refer the Committee to that table on page 39. The Opposition are assuming that where the compensation order or the amount outstanding on the compensation order does not exceed £25 and the payee is in default of paying, that person will be sentenced to seven days' imprisonment, and so on throughout the table. That would be aggregated with a sentence in respect of fine default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) predicted that this legislation would not decrease the prison population but would increase it. There is just the possibility— I put it no higher than that—that this subsection of clause 64 will have precisely that effect. It could add to the administrative costs. Those who have been involved from time to time in penal matters know that there is an enormous cost involved in fine defaulters going to prison and somebody rushing up to Barlinnie and paying either all, or part of, the fine and so many days being taken off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a principle, I am not sure that the Opposition are happy with the possibility of prison sentences being imposed. We accepted earlier that prison sentences are imposed in lieu of default of payment of the compensation order. We are anxious to find out from the Solicitor-General for Scotland how this will work. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman does not agree that there will be a temptation on the part of the court, because it cannot impose a prison sentence in lieu of default of payment of a compensation order only?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is an outstanding part of the fine, or if all the fine is outstanding, provided that both things have been applied, there will not be a temptation for the court to pass a prison sentence on the non-payment of both the compensation order and of the fine. If that were so, the prediction that my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1352</span>
Member for South Ayrshire made this morning about possible difficulties and increases in the prison population could easily become a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept fully that that is not the Government's intention. The Opposition are anxious to help the Government to ensure that they do not fall foul or become victims of their own legislation by achieving something that they never set out to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and having moved the amendment, I am keen to hear what the Solicitor-General for Scotland has to say on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me particular pleasure to reply to the amendment with fluency by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), because hon. Members who had the advantage of being on the Committee on the Labour Government's Bill will remember that I joined with the greatly lamented hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden in his attempt to say that it was nonsense that default on a fine should result in imprisonment. But we all came up against the insoluble problem of “Why ever bother to pay a fine then?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth was the Minister and we came up against the insoluble problem that nobody in his right mind would pay a fine if the alternative to paying it was not paying it. None of us could think of an ultimate solution to that dilemma. All of us wanted to find one and none of us could. That is the ultimate difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a very different protection for compensation orders. It is not, as with a fine, that imprisonment automatically replaces it in default. A fine is a matter of last resort and the Government have particularly protected it for that reason, because what good is it to the victim? If one is trying to reward the victim, the imprisonment or default of the offender counts for nothing. It is of no benefit to the victim at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while it must be there as an ultimate sanction, we have put as many options and safeguards in the way of that final sanction—apart from a fine—as are conceivable. If Labour Members have any alternative or additional ones, no doubt they will let us know. Someone who defaults on a compensation order will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1353</span>
automatically be the subject of a means inquiry. Whereas with a fine he would automatically, or probably, have a period of imprisonment, there must be an inquiry at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us deal with various categories of offenders. There may be someone who cannot pay because of change in circumstances. There may be a person who can pay but will not pay, and I cannot believe that Labour Members say that if someone —let us take our multi-national—can pay, but does not pay, the alternative to paying should be just nothing. So inevitably there must be an ultimate sanction, but there will be an inevitable supervision order which the court can make and a means inquiry, and all steps will be taken to prevent prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear. On whom are we to put compensation orders? I want to say this to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). We shall either put a compensation order on someone who would have been fined or on somebody who would have been imprisoned— or possibly somebody who might have been put on probation. If someone was to be fined and he defaulted on the fine, he would have gone straight to prison, whereas with a compensation order there is every chance and hope that he never will. If he would have gone to prison, but there is a compensation order, that is a reduction of the prison population. So contrary to the hon. Member's fears— echoed by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth—it is our sincere hope that this will result in fewer people going to prison. But there must eventually be a sanction, subject to the very considerable safeguards which this procedure has over fines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Sohcitor-General for Scotland. I know that he means well. I do not mean to be patronising in any sense. He has attempted to be on the side of the angels in this matter and I think he has succeeded. I think he has got it right. I welcome his words when he said that every possible means will be found to try to secure compensation for the victim and avoid sending the culprit to prison. We take his point and thank him for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said that there would be a supervision order of some kind which would help in dealing with these matters, as it has in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1354</span>
past, by a fine. He also said that there was another method that we should try to use to avoid the ultimate penalty of imprisonment, namely, to bring in a means inquiry. I may be very obtuse here, but the means inquiry aspect is not referred to in clause 64 which refers back to the 1975 Act. It is certainly not in part IV of this Bill. I should be grateful if the hon. and learned Gentleman could explain how this comes into these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complicated matter. It is hidden in the embroidery above the point we are discussing, at line 10,
	<br><q><p>"'section 398 (reasons for default);"</p></q>
which, under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act for fines, is applied to compensation orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Solicitor-General for Scotland said, while giving notice that my hon. Friend may want to return to the matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is not unimportant. It raises a number of important issues. I am concerned that some of the present arrangements that apply to fines will be applied holus-bolus—I do not know what language we are into there; it is certainly not Latin—will apply right across the board 	<i>simpliciter</i>—not quite that—to compensation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of the present arrangements in district courts is that they are more properly organised than sheriff courts and High Courts. A large number of minor offences are dealt with there. The clause refers to the
	<br><q><p>"application of money found on offender."</p></q>
We have the position where the clerk of the court says with a broad wink and a nudge that the accused was found with £13.40 on him. That is always a broad hint to the magistrate that if he were to fine him between £10 and £13 the money is on him and would be easily obtained, whereas if he were fined £15 it would be difficult to fine him that amount and a lot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1355</span>
of paperwork would be involved. All this nudging and winking is not conducive to the proper course of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter is the business of paying at the bar of the court, which is why, on the previous amendment, I asked about the methods of payment. One reaches a stage where, before the fine is off the court official's lips, the money is being brought up to the judge. That is an inappropriate way for it to be done. Then one reaches the stage of a time to pay and payment comes in instalments. It is almost like a bartering or selling of encyclopaedias. One reaches the stage that a convicted person or the lawyer on his behalf starts negotiating for time to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that as regards compensation orders there ought to be a greater decorum, some more order or some better procedure. If we cannot find that for fines, we should at least be able to find it for compensation orders. The business about bartering for time to pay and payment in instalments in regard to convicted persons—which I am sure the Solicitor-General for Scotland used in his previous capacity—is a most inappropriate way in which to deal with it. It is most regrettable that that kind of system takes place in courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much more regrettable to have that kind of haggling and bartering on compensation orders, particularly if the old ladies we have talked of who have been mugged, or had their gardens dug up, are present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be wrong, but my reading of clause 64 in the way in which it is drafted is that all these provisions in regard to fines are likely to apply 	<i>mutatis mutandis.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member inform the Committee what that means and what construction his words are meant to have? Is he using gerunds or gerundives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never do such a thing—not in public, anyway. I have heard that as a defence, especially in shoplifting cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the provisions seem to be applying, 	<i>mutatis mutandis,</i> to compensation orders as they are applying currently to fines. I think from some of the procedures that I have seen, particularly in the district courts, that that might create a great embarrassment and be very inappropriate. I hope that the Solicitor-General will give some consideration to this. It may not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1356</span>
appropriate to deal with it through legislation, but it might be appropriate and sensible for the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his colleague, the Lord Advocate, to issue some guidance to the courts, or for someone to issue guidance, about the appropriate ways of dealing with it, so that we do not get this most unfortunate hassle that takes place, especially in district courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so to the hon. Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gerund or gerundive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was, in fact, using a gerundive, although he did not understand it. Even if he had looked it up, I do not think he would understand what 	<i>mutatis mutandis</i> means. He is the only member of the Committee who is constantly trying to run down his own public school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the Act of Adjournal will deal with this matter, but in the case of a fine a solicitor takes the view that he is, able to say “I did at least get you a cherry stone". If he loses the case his client is fined and is able to suggest instalments of 50p a week and he is able to say “I got you instalments". I regret to have to advise the hon. Member for South Ayrshire that I did not deal in matters that attracted fines, and, with great respect to those hon. Members behind me, rarely in matters that attracted convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a difference between fines and compensation orders. With a fine one is essentially trying by this haggling over about £2 a week to keep the chap out of prison—to ensure that the amount he pays is one which will never result in a default. In a case where we have the old lady, it is awfully unfair if she is only to get 50p a month, and the court will have to balance the two things in mind. The court will not wish to get into a position where the chap has been fined more than he will be able to pay and where one risks depriving the victim of the compensation and, ultimately, after means tests, inquiries and so on, putting the offender into prison. It is a balancing matter. I am quite sure that courts will have these matters primarily in mind. It is not a tidy procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much easier—dare I say this to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes)—if people were fined, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1357</span>
paid their fines on the spot. It is expensive and untidy to do it in dribbles. But, nevertheless, that is one way in which we can keep people out of prison while requiring them to pay an appropriate penalty. I hope that in regard to compensation orders the victim as well as the offender will be considered, for the benefit of both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points that need elucidation and there is some clarification of the language that the Solicitor-General for Scotland might look at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point refers to something I said earlier and concerns civil proceedings. This is quite clear in a sense because it is one of the clearer clauses in the Bill. The civil proceedings would probably take place some time after the criminal case and would be quite lengthy. As provided in subsection (2), the damages awarded by the civil court could be less than the compensation that had been paid by the convicted person under the compensation order made by the criminal court. In such circumstances, does that person have any recompense against the victim or the first court? Probably the time at which the victim could make an appeal would have passed before the second court sat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland is nodding. It would appear that I am correct. Therefore is there not a certain amount of injustice if a person has obtained civil recourse against the convicted person and the civil court? The court would probably have looked at the case in considerably more detail in terms of compensation than the criminal court. As I have been trying to say throughout, there does not seem to be a very good procedure in the Bill by which the criminal court assesses the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1358</span>
amount of compensation and arrives at it in any clear-cut actuarial way—the term used by the Solicitor-General himself. It is not clear in the Bill how that would be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The civil court would probably look at it in much more detail. It would expect to have expert witnesses called who would give their opinion as to the value of an article, or a doctor might assess injuries in an assault case. If the court comes to a decision that the damages that should be awarded are less than those awarded by the criminal court in the first place, and if the chap loses the opportunity to appeal, there must be an injustice if his time for appeal lapses, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Solicitor-General for Scotland will look at that point and come back on it. I hope he will either introduce some way of producing an actuarial assessment by compensation orders or put something in the clause that would allow for repayment if that should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about the wording of the clause. The meaning is clear but I do not think that as it is written it necessarily makes much sense. Subsection (3) states that
	<br><q><p>"the court shall direct that the judgment"</p></q>
shall not happen
	<br><q><p>"without the leave of the court."</p></q>
What court is that? We know that two different courts are involved. One is the civil court and the other is the criminal court. But I consider that the language of the clause might have been clearer so as to differentiate between the two courts, because as it reads it almost sounds as as though the court is asking the leave of itself so as to make that particular judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that that is purely a drafting point. In terms of statute, it may not be necessary. It may be my own simplistic concern with language that is the problem here and that the Solicitor-General's legal mind can tell me that it is not necessary. However, I still feel that the matter would be a little clearer if there were differentiation between the two courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to the end of an important part of the Bill. I am sure that Lord Dunpark, and those members of his committee who are still with us, will ponder the fact that a Stand-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1359</span>
ing Committee of the House of Commons has dealt with the whole problem of reparation to the victim by the offender in no more than three or four hours' sitting, after all the work that the Dunpark committee put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth recording that the last act of the previous Tory Law Officer, now Lord Wylie, was to appoint the Dunpark committee and that the first act of the present Tory Law Officer was to implement that committee's recommendations. I do not think that it should go unnoticed that there was an intervening six years when the people of Scotland were much happier than they are today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist that temptation. But the clause is important, in the sense that it links, in yet one more way, the criminal law with the civil law in Scotland. I am anxious for the Solicitor-General to place on record that it is not the purpose of the Scottish criminal courts to usurp the function of the civil courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) says, clause 65 is fairly explicit. It has got the matter right in that, where a compensation order has been attached by the criminal court, and subsequently the victim pursues a case through civil diligence, the amount awarded will be reduced by the amount that was attached by the criminal court. That is justice. None of us would wish to subject anyone to double jeopardy. We have dealt with that problem in our discussions on other questions, and we are anxious to avoid doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that request to the Solicitor-General to place on record that it is not intended that the criminal courts should usurp the powers, functions and purposes of the civil courts, I am content with clause 65 and I give a general welcome to this whole part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

should usurp the function of the civil court, which has its own procedures for the assessment of damages. As the hon.

Let me say this, for it is important. I wish to explain the clause as it is, because I understand that it may be difficult to see what it says. As the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth says, its purpose is to prevent anyone being put in double jeopardy, but also to prevent anyone getting double reward. The risk of double reward, indeed, is greater than that of double jeopardy, because it is likely that an insurance company will pay one half and the offender will pay the other half if there is double jeopardy. If, for instance, a person caused injury to another and was insured against such injury, in certain circumstances he might not be suffering double jeopardy but the victim would be getting double reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause essentially says that, if the compensation order does not exceed the civil award, the civil award will be paid only to the extent that the civil award exceeds the compensation order, but the jury or the court making the award shall not take into account the compensation order. In other words, it does not say “You have had £2,000 already. We think your claim is worth £4,000 and we shall award you £2,000". It cannot take into account the compensation order or anything that has happened. That is the first point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—the ghost is still haunting me. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised a concept which I think is extremely unlikely to occur, namely, what would happen if the court ordered compensation of £5,000 and the civil jury sitting in judgment awarded £500. I am afraid that that would be bad luck, and for a variety of reasons it is extremely unlikely to happen. By the time a civil jury sat, it would be two years old.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and the civil court, in pursuance of the case, awards £500, it would mean that £5,500 had been awarded. The only situation that could prevail would be if the civil courts were able to award a minus sum, and for the life of me I do not see how that could happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people concerned would not get the £500 for a start, because that would be covered by the compensation. I think that it is extremely unlikely to happen, and this is the most equitable assessment that has come up.

I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth for giving a general welcome to this, and I want to put on record—as, I am sure, would all hon. Members—my gratitude for the extremely painstaking work which the Dunpark committee did in coming forward with a resolution to a very difficult problem—a resolution which I hope, in the simple form which the Bill introduces, will do great benefit to the victim and increase the sense in the offender that he has wounded an ordinary person who can be recompensed in some way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Solicitor-General keeps complimenting or insulting me by alluding to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but in terms of my hon. Friend's contribution to the Committee I will take it as a compliment that he now puts me in the same class.

I want now to make a serious point. May I put a case to the Solicitor-General?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the hon. Gentleman? I may have misled the Committee. I had forgotten clause 62, which allows a compensation order to be reduced if the award in civil
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1362</span>
proceedings is less than the compensation order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That answers my first question but I now have another to raise. What if the person who claims for damages is not the person who actually had the compensation order? In other words, what if it is an insurance company? Let us say that someone steals a car and smashes it up. The owner has a full comprehensive policy and is covered for the damage by the insurance company, but the company would like to get its money back. The owner receives a compensation order from the court which met before it knew this and the insurance company then takes action for damages against the offender to reclaim its compensation to the owner of the car. Does the clause cover such a case as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of using another gerund and increasing the vocabulary of the hon.
