JURISDICTION OF DISTRICT COURTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 9, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'It shall be competent for either of the following offences to be tried in the district court by a stipendiary magistrate—
<ol>
<li>theft by housebreaking or housebreaking with intent to steal;</li>
<li>assault whereby a limb has been fractured.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I regard this as an admirable opportunity to raise a number of matters of interest. I am glad to have such an opportunity. Nevertheless, I do not put forward my amendments entirely in a probing spirit. I have no preconceived view, but perhaps, by the end of the debates, we shall be hoping that we have persuaded other members of the Committee of the merit of the amendments.<br><br>
I hope that I shall not be accused, as I have been once or twice, of arrogance. However, I think that this is an area where a different type of expertise comes into play. It is not an area of court life where we are likely to see a great deal of the Faculty of Advocates. Solicitors, however, ply their trade in the district courts on a daily basis. I appear fairly frequently in both the Glasgow and the Monklands district courts. I am well aware that the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is a proud ornament of the district court Bench in the wild Highland fastnesses from which he operates. I certainly hope that we shall get the benefit of his views in the debates which will open up the whole question of the operation of district courts, and how they should be placed within the spectrum of Scottish courts.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 822</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the hon. Gentleman to decide on which course of action he thinks most appropriate. However, I think that I shall be able to respond very quickly to the two amendments to the clause that have been tabled. In order to avoid any doubt, it may make more sense if the general debate that I am sure that the hon. Gentleman desires takes place on clause stand part. As the amendments relate to very specific matters, they can be dealt with quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be best if I were to move the amendments more or less formally, with no further ado, and hear what the Under-Secretary has to say. I am anxious to hear his remarks. Amendment No. 180, like the next amendment, No. 181, stems from my desire to see a wider use of the stipendiary magistrate rather than the lay magistrate. The argument is as old as the hills. I suspect that when we have heard the Under-Secretary we may wish to go climbing again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving his amendment so briefly. When he has heard what I have to say I think that he will appreciate why I made the suggestion. His proposal is that where a district court is sitting under a stipendiary magistrate it should have certain powers that are not normally available to a district court, in particular in relation to the two offences of theft by housebreaking or housebreaking with intent to steal and assault where a limb has been fractured.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that, under section 3(2) of the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975, courts that are sitting with a stipendiary magistrate already have the same jurisdiction over matters that would normally be dealt with in a sheriff court. The two offences mentioned in the amendment can, therefore, already be dealt with by such a court. Wherever a district court has a stipendiary magistrate rather than a lay magistrate, its jurisdiction is exactly the same as that of a sheriff court. Because the proposals in the amendment would clearly be competent in the sheriff court, it equally follows, under section 3(2) of the 1975 Act, that it would be competent in the district courts.<br><br>
I share with the hon. Gentlemen the view that stipendiary magistrates can often
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0509">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
make an important contribution. He will be pleased to know that the objective of his amendment is met by the existing law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting observation. I apologise if I have wasted the Committee's time in any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Government would never have told us if my hon. Friend had not asked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am overwhelmed with the expressions of goodwill from all sides of the Committee. They touch my heart. I of course note that the Solicitor-General is minuting his dissent. He has always had a touch of the contrary.<br><br>
It might be best, in the circumstances, if I withdrew the amendment, but on the understanding that we shall have a clause stand part debate that will allow us to deal with a number of issues which I for one wish to raise. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 9, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>(4) No lay magistrate shall preside in a district court unless there is present a legally qualified assessor for the purpose of giving advice and any such advice shall be tendered in open court.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a very simple amendment, arising from my own observations, and it crops up in a number of the submissions that have been made to us. I am not absolutely clear what the legal position is in this respect. I know that the Under-Secretary of State will help me. But, as a matter of practice that has been much commented upon, I know that there has been a tendency for lay magistrates to sit in district courts without a legal assessor. The sheriff clerk tends in that case to double up. The sheriff clerk is an admirable gentleman, no doubt, but he is not in a position to give legal advice to the Bench.<br><br>
What happens is that a submission is made on, say, sufficiency of evidence or what have you, and all that one can then see is the backside of the sheriff clerk wiggling out at one as he leans over and attempts to advise the magistrate what his rights and his range of options are. That seems a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation.<br><br>
I have already briefly indicated my own
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 824</span>
view that it would be much better if we used stipendiaries more extensively than lay magistrates. But, given that we have lay magisgrates in situ, it seems important that there should be a clear legal duty to have a legally-qualified assessor who will have the necessary expertise on technical points.<br><br>
This is not in itself an anti-lay magistrates amendment. Clearly, they cannot claim to be lawyers. Exactly the same complicated points of legal procedure can arise in a district court as can arise in the High Court of Justiciary. It seems only common sense, from the point of view of the administration of justice, that a legal assessor should be present on all occasions.<br><br>
I shall say no more at this point, but await with interest what the Under-Secretary has to say and whether he can reassure me that, in some way, the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has expressed his view that on all occasions in the district courts there should be a legally-qualified assessor. He has expressed his concern that the person who acts in this way, at least in certain of the courts, is the clerk of court. I have to refer him to section 7(1) of the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975, which was passed by the Labour Government. Indeed, I think that the hon. Gentleman was on the Committee considering that Bill. No, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. He was not in the House at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was in the district court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He was in the district court indeed. In that case he can to some extent be forgiven for forgetting what section 7(1) of the Act says. I should perhaps read it out to assist the hon. Gentleman. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of each local authority to appoint and employ, whether on a full-time or part-time basis, an officer to act as clerk of the district court for their area, who shall also act as legal assessor in that court, and any person so appointed shall be an advocate or a solicitor."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will understand that the fact that the clerk of the court acts as an assessor is not an incidental matter but is specifically required by the 1975 Act, which also insists that the clerk should be a qualified solicitor or advocate, thereby
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0510">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
ensuring that he has the necessary legal qualifications.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemans can be assured that not only is the purpose of the amendment met by existing law, but the existing law produces a statutory requirement that the clerk of court in these circumstances should be the legal assessor. Therefore, I am sure that hon. Gentlemans will agree that the amendment is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely interested to hear that. I must confess that I was not aware of that subsection in the 1975 Act. I greet it with a little scepticism, because I understand the Under-Secretary to be saying that the clerk to the court is per se the assessor and must be legally qualified. I have appeared in many district courts personally in which to my knowledge the clerk of the court has not been legally qualified and has purported to give advice to the Bench and no one else has appeared.<br><br>
It is true that in the Monklands district court the clerk to the court was a solicitor. There was a solicitors' rota from the town clerk's department. Sometimes they were not very well experienced in court work, having been dragged unwillingly from a conveyancing desk to do their obligatory week, but I accept that that happened in the Monklands court.<br><br>
But my strong impression—the Under-Secretary may be able to reassure me—is that very often the clerk to the court, at least in situ, is not legally qualified. There may be a nominally legally-qualified clerk to the court, but he is often conspicuous by his absence, and the person in charge is often a junior clerk who has just come in as an administrative figure and does not have legal administrative experience.<br><br>
Perhaps the Under-Secretary can say a word or two on whether the Scottish Office has been monitoring the way in which local authorities have responded on a day-to-day basis to this requirement and whether legally-qualified clerks are always available to magistrates, because we never know at what point a matter of legal complexity may emerge from the undergrowth of an apparently simple and straightforward stairhead brawl or breach of the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak as to the position in Monklands, although I shall certainly have that matter looked into.<br><br>
The only part of Scotland where there is a slight variation from what I have said,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
although it still comes within the statutory requirement, is in the city of Glasgow, where, because only one person is officially the clerk of court although there are seven separate courts, it is clearly not possible for that one person to be physically present in all seven courts. Three of them are stipendiary magistrate courts anyway and therefore the legal assessor is not required. In the other four courts I understand that a separately-appointed legal assessor acts to give advice to the lay magistrates. There is also the deputy clerk of court, who acts as assessor.<br><br>
But I understand the present position to be that those who give advice to the magistrate need to be legally qualified in order to give appropriate advice. If I find that that is not the case, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. I should have thought that it was a clear requirement under the relevant statute that the person responsible as the assessor should be legally qualified. I hope that with that explanation the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p>4.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have one or two lingering suspicions, but I am not in a position to push charges in Committee. I hasten to straighten out a misapprehension which I may unwittingly have planted in the Minister's mind. I specifically referred to the Monklands court in order to give it a clean bill of health. I said that legal assessors were always present, although sometimes—this is no criticism of individuals—a little short of court experience. But there was no suggestion that they were in breach of the Act.<br><br>
There is another minor matter which I wish to raise. It is purely to clear up a doubt in the mind of the council of the Law Society of Scotland. It will probably be familiar to the Minister who will have looked at its memorandum. The point appears in column 8.3:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council understands that a practice is being adopted in some District Courts whereby the Clerk of Court or Legal Assessor, who is entitled to advise the magistrates as to the law affecting the case, retires to the Magistrates' Chambers to give that assistance, and the Council is concerned that his function might then become more that of an additional judge than of an adviser on the law. The Council considers that any such advice should be given in open Court."</p></blockquote>
Despite the fact that we shall have a stand part debate, this might be a con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0511">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
venient point to raise that matter. I have some sympathy with the Law Society's point that if the legal assessor is to give advice, he should do so openly, as a matter of law in open court, and should not retire to chambers to do it secretly, where his influence may spill over into decision-making functions which are properly those of the lay magistrate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman and the Law Society are making. There is a difficulty in seeking to impose a statutory requirement of the kind that the hon. Gentleman suggests. No doubt in many cases it would be appropriate for the clerk of court in open court to indicate the legal position as he understands it. But there are other matters on which he may be correcting what the lay magistrate would like to do, but which may be beyond the lay magistrate's powers.<br><br>
We must be conscious of the fact that the lay magistrate is the person in charge of the court. It could be offensive to his dignity if, in practice, the clerk of court appeared to make public pronouncements which the lay magistrate, in full view of those within the court, was obliged to follow.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be the first to appreciate that there have been cases in which lay magistrates, without appropriate experience, have sought to do things beyond their powers. It is much more sensible and desirable that they should be quietly informed of the legal position and the extent of their powers, than that it should be said publicly, thereby embarrassing the magistrate and making his general authority open to question. There should not be a rigid rule about such matters. There is no reason why genuine complex matters of law should not be stated openly. It is not prevented by existing law and that seems an appropriate way of handling the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the community of view between the solicitor and the advocate, with a nice trade union heart to the matter, if a lawyer has to be employed in this way. There seems to be a little trade union solidarity involved. It would be interesting to know how much they are paid. Can the Minister tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened, he would have realised that the legal assessor is, in virtually all circum-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
stances, the clerk of the court. It is part of a clerk of the court's functions for which he receives a salary. The job is not done by a separate lawyer, independent solicitor or advocate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the question remains. What is the general level of pay for the legal assessor, solicitor or whatever?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what a clerk of the court's normal salary is. No doubt we can find that information. He does not receive a separate salary for the small part of his responsibilities involved in acting as a legal assessor in the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that we shall save money if we employ the same person?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we can clear the amendment before we start discussing other matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I am to approve this I must know what kind of terrible public expenditure this concept is leading us into. I am always concerned about the public purse. Before I agree to withdraw the amendment, it would be interesting to know the cost of the legal profession to the poor lay community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are lots of legal advisers around. However, perhaps I could dispatch the amendment in short order. I am not entirely happy with the Under-Secretary's remarks, although I appreciate his difficulties. But I should have thought that he could have said something actively to encourage the idea that whenever possible legal advice should be given in open court rather than saying, a little grudgingly, that there is nothing at present that would have prevented it. I should think that something slightly more enthusiastic was called for.<br><br>
However, I do not want to make a song and dance about the matter. It has been ventilated and the Under-Secretary certainly dealt adequately with it in respect of the 1975 Act, which was the main point. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be supported by many of my hon. Friends—and I hope by hon. Gentlemen opposite—who see this as an admirable opportunity, at a time that is convenient to us all, to examine the function of district courts. Clause 7 is a general updating and amendment of their jurisdiction, which leads us into far-reaching problems concerning their competence and the way in which they operate.<br><br>
I hasten to say that my remarks will be a little bit of a pipe opener. I hope to start one or two arguments and perhaps we can then see the response to the bait. I make no apology for starting the stand part debate because those of us who are battle-scarred veterans of the Committee stage of the previous Bill will remember that the analagous clause—I believe that it was clause 13—of the Labour Party's measure was debated at length.<br><br>
I hope that he will not think that I misrepresenting him when I say that the moving spirit of that debate was the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), who is now the Solicitor-General. He made clear that he had little time or respect for district courts. At least that was the impression that his speeches left. Indeed, to give a brief flavour to the matter. If members of the Committee read that report they will see that the hon. and learned Gentleman stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Those who have political office at local authority level very frequently fill these positions."</p></blockquote>
The point he was making was that there was too much of a political hack input—that was the general spirit of his remarks—in district courts. I hope that he did not include his hon. Friend, that doughty Conservative Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) in that benighted category.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"I know that they do not have to fill them, but they do."</p></blockquote>
He went on to this mature judgment:
<br><blockquote><p>"The fact is that we used colloquially to call these courts the 'egg and chip' courts, and I think it important that there be a restriction on their powers. Their powers of sentence and the type of offences which they try must be severely restricted".</p></blockquote>
Egg and chip courts they may be, but I have some reservations about that type of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
language because I believe that a large number of people in district courts do a good job and work extrenely hard. I say that in the light of some criticisms that I shall make a little later.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman warmed to his theme. His verdict was that:
<br><blockquote><p>"justice is frequently so rough"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in district courts—
<br><blockquote><p>"that it ceases to be justice at all."</p></blockquote>
That is a very serious charge for the second most senior Law Officer in Scotland to make. If his remarks were well founded there would, of course, be a case for sweeping reforms in the criminal justice system.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to object to the fact that certain proposals were then before the Committee to extend the powers of the district courts. He protested:
<br><blockquote><p>"to make the district court a sort of part-time, acting, when-you-need-it sheriff court seems to me to debase both the seriousness of the offence and the seriousness of the conviction of that offence for the person who is to be tried."</p></blockquote>
We have, then, from the Solicitor-General a statement that justice is sometimes so rough as not to be justice at all and a protest about turning district courts into
<br><blockquote><p>'a sort of part-time, acting, when-you-need-it sheriff court",</p></blockquote>
which he apparently viewed as debasing the criminal justice system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend not being unfair to the Solicitor-General? The hon. and learned Gentleman foresaw an important role for the district courts. He said, with much generosity:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not mind anybody appearing in the burgh court for an offence of leaving the lid off his dustbin, or shouting or whistling or spitting or being drunk or urinating in the street".</p></blockquote>
Those are apparently the offences that he though appropriate to be dealt with by district courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that gives with some accuracy the flavour of the now Solicitor-General's view of those who serve in district courts. It is interesting that he protested at great length about efforts to increase the powers of the district courts.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
I am only scanning the <i>Official Report</i> fairly briefly, and so may have missed many good things. However, I have just spotted the hon. and learned Gentleman's complaint about district courts being allowed to deal with
<br><blockquote><p>"a serious offence of embezzlement—a company secretary who might be found to have removed only £200 although that might be the tip of the iceberg. It would, in my submission, be thoroughly inappropriate to try so serious an offence in the district court."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6 February 1979; c. 293–6].</p></blockquote>
I quote that merely as a corrective against looking for consistency from the Solicitor-General. I observe that clause 7 of this Bill leaves the power to try people for ambezzlement within the jurisdiction of the district courts.<br><br>
I accept the validity of the quotation drawn to my attention by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). However, I maintain that we must not accuse the hon. and learned Gentleman of being consistent when he manifestly is not. The case of ambezzlement is another example of his falling away from his own standards as expressed—I will not say his high standards.<br><br>
In general terms the Solicitor-General has unmistakably given the thumbs down to district courts, and made it clear that he regards them as having a very minor role to play in the judicial system. I am sorry to say that they are a part of the judicial system which is operating in thoroughly unsatisfactory circumstances.<br><br>
In case we should give the impression that only the Solicitor-General took that view, I should add that his view was fairly widely shared during the debate. Let us take the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). We do not have to read his speeches very often as, for a practising advocate, as he then was, the hon. Gentleman says very little in debates. At the next sitting of the Committee he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"For example, if I were suffering from appendicitis, I should not wish the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to take out my appendix."—</p></blockquote>
Thank goodness for that. I should in any case have declined the invitation—
<br><blockquote><p>"Although he might make a very good job of it,"—</p></blockquote>
I am flattered—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"the chances are that, without serious professional training, he would not. There is a real danger that with serious crimes this could lead to rejoicing in Barlinnie as the hon. Member for Dundee, East said."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1979; c. 320.]</p></blockquote>
The point being made was that district courts were equally incompetent to deal with any serious offence. I can appreciate the force of that argument. There is clearly a general feeling on the Conservative Benches that a great deal is amiss with the present operation of the district courts. That is a serious matter, which deserves consideration at some length by the Committee.<br><br>
I wish to dissociate myself from the more extravagant language used by the Solicitor-General. I have many friends who have served in the district courts. I hope that they do not all fall into the category of political hacks. They have taken their duties on the Bench extremely seriously and have tried at all times to keep a sensible, humane and balanced view of the cases appearing before them. It is right to say that I have also appeared, in the districts courts when justice has been, on occasions, somewhat eccentric. That has not been because of a lack of heart but due to al lack of expertise and an inability to recognise some of the more simple procedural rules which would become clear to a trained lawyer.<br><br>
4.45 am<br><br>
Therefore, if I am to make critical remarks about district courts it is not in terms of consigning them to the dustbin, or of thinking of them as egg and chip courts. There is nothing more important than having at the base of the pyramid which is our court system a series of locally-based courts where magistrates representing the community are involved in dealing with the problems affecting, in many ways in a more widespread and thorough way than the dramatic crimes, the standard of life and the environment of those people who live in the area. That is a reasonable proposition. There is a balance to be struck.<br><br>
I must say—and I do so in no crabbed spirit or in trying to defend or push a vested interest as a solicitor—that we should be moving more towards stipendiaries, particularly in the busier city areas. That is not to say that I wish to exclude entirely the lay element. After all, I spent four very enjoyable years as a reporter on the children's panel. I would argue very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
strongly that it was the level of public involvement, the bringing of the public into contact with the problems of children in trouble, which was one of the positive strengths of a system which is now recognised by Ministers as making a valuable contribution to the drop in juvenile crime.<br><br>
I was delighted to see in a recent issue of the <i>Sunday Post</i> that it believed the children's panels were responsible for the remarkable drop in juvenile crime in Glasgow and Strathclyde. It is remarkable indeed—a sinner repentant. I agree with the look of surprise on the face of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). It gives me great pleasure to record the fact that the <i>Sunday Post</i> went out of its way, in very typical prose, surrounded by one of its little crinkly borders, to record that American professors were visiting Strathclyde to look at the children's panel system. I knew that it was in the <i>Sunday Post,</i> even if I had not cut it out myself, because it said that it is reckoned that one of the main causes of the decline in juvenile crime was the success of the children's panel system.<br><br>
We have converted the Conservative Front Bench to the children's panel system and we have now converted even the <i>Sunday Post.</i> That may not be surprising, because I have long suspected that the <i>Sunday Post</i> is written by the Conservative Front Bench. It certainly used to be, and I suspect it still is.<br><br>
My experiences with the children's panel gave me an appreciation of the positive value of lay involvement. It is always a matter of balance, and my own view, clearly and fundamentally, is that in the busier courts we ought to be employing more stipendiaries. I do not know—perhaps the Minister can give the figures—how many stipendiaries there are at present, or how we are progressing outside Glasgow in introducing them. I am aware that there are three or four stipendiary courts sitting in Glasgow. The exact details can no doubt be filled in by the Minister. But I do not know whether Dundee, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and perhaps some of the busier county areas, are also now using them.<br><br>
Despite what I said, I believe that it is very useful for the lay magistrates—the hon. Member for Argyll may wish to comment on this—to have contact with the stipendiary magistrates, perhaps sitting in the same court complex and keeping an eye
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
on consistency of sentencing and helping with any procedural or legal problems that may arise. I certainly hold the view that that would do something to raise the standards of the lay magistracy and assuage the unreasonable prejudices of the Solicitor-General on this subject.<br><br>
I do not want to make it sound as though I am converted to the case for lay magistrates as the single basic component of the lower courts. I believe that if I had been involved in extremely complicated legislation that took place when the district courts were being reformed or set up, I might well have been on the side of moving further from lay magistrates than the compromise that was ultimately reached.<br><br>
I remember some extremely witty stories from my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) about the dangers of filibustering in order to preserve a majority on these very Bills where the poor man spoke for an hour and threequarters until a certain Member arrived—who then proceeded to vote with the Tories. But leaving that aside, I would probably have been on the side of those who would have wished to see more use made of the stipendiaries, but I think that I would do it in terms of running them in tandem, if that is not too undignified a metaphor, with the lay magistrates in the hope that we would have a more consistent standard of justice and use of court and legal procedures in the district courts as a result.<br><br>
I recognise, Mr. Armstrong, that I cannot discuss in any detail the fate of the amendment which I have just withdrawn) but the whole point of that amendment was an attempt to illustrate this point by introducing two specific powers—I use this only in arguments in terms of what I am saying on clause stand part—the right to deal with theft by housebreaking or housebreaking with intent to steal and the right to deal with assault where a limb has been fractured. These were originally proposed by the Labour Adminitration in the last Bill. I have to say that I was a rebel and it was my vote that defeated one of these provisions, I think rightly. The Committee then took the view that it could not be given to lay magistrates sitting as they do. I sought to introduce these powers—erroneously as it turned out because such power has already been granted to stipendaries—to draw attention to the fact that if there is to be a radical updating of the powers of the district courts it is better
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
to do that through stipendaries than through the lay magistrates.<br><br>
As it turns out, the amendment was redundant because the power is already available to stipendaries, but the sort of reverse argument to be drawn from the amendment still stands firm. If there had been a proposal in the Bill and the inconsistency of the Solicitor-General had been taken to remarkable lengths and he had re-introduced these particular offences of theft by housebreaking or housebreaking with intent and assault where a limb had been fractured as a proposed extension of district court powers per se, not limited to stipendary, I would have voted against it as I did when it was introduced by my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Labour Government's Bill.<br><br>
Therefore, if we see that the district courts are to extend their range of activities in the hope that we will be able to take some of the stress and strain off the sheriff courts, I believe that it must be through an extended use of stipendaries if we are to make any real progress. It is important that we make real progress because as you, Mr. Armstrong, will realise, there is a major crisis at the moment in the sheriff courts. I shall not describe it extensively because I appreciate that that would be a little wide when we are discussing the district courts although, obviously, it impinges on and is relevant to the subject. We are now in a position where we have to wait very many months, in Glasgow sheriff court, for example, before even the simplest of summary trials can be arranged. The system is literally creaking to the point where it is near to breaking down.<br><br>
I say that in a spirit of sadness and I do not believe that anyone would fundamentally quarrel with that judgment. Of course, there is a number of law reform proposals in the air at present. Perhaps the most significant of these, which has been referred to en passant in earlier debates, is the proposals that divorce jurisidiction should come to the sheriff court. We know that sheriff principal Reid has made some calculations for Glasgow sheriff court and has come to the conclusion that even on the present basis this would be a manageable burden. I find that reassuring, because he is in a position to form a measured and responsible judgment, but I believe that a lot of us would feel that if we are to have that very necessary reform in the public interest, it will be necessary to shift some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
of the burden of work from the sheriff courts to the district courts. That may well mean a more flexible view among the procurators fiscal departments to the allocation of cases to the district courts.<br><br>
If those extended powers are to be the way in which that is done, clearly it means more stipendiary magistrates. That gives added force to my plea for some report on the Government's attitude to this and the moves they are taking to improve stnadards in the district court and, to a minor extent, perhaps also to shift the balance in a way that will be helpful to the proper and expeditious dispatch of business in the criminal courts.<br><br>
One matter in connection with the district courts might be conveniently raised at this point, if only to get the comments of the Under-Secretary. In Glasgow district court we are in the middle of an extremely peculiar and interesting dispute. From the last Criminal Justice Bill a section was removed and taken as a separate Act. It became the Bail Etc. (Scotland) Act. If I remember rightly, section 14 brought in a provision that some hon. Members greatly opposed—namely, that Saturday courts would become optional. As far as I know, that option not to hold Saturday courts has been taken up with great enthusiasm by the sheriff courts throughout the land.<br><br>
I deplore that. It needs no great erudition in the ways of the law to appreciate that someone who is arrested on a Friday night will have to lie in custody until a Monday, rather than a Saturday, before probably being bailed. That is happening daily.<br><br>
The relevance of that to a clause stand part debate on the district courts is that the same option was allowed to district courts. In Glasgow, which is by far the most important district court in Scotland and is extremely busy, the option has not been taken up. The Glasgow district council has indicated that it wishes to have Saturday courts in order to ensure that those people who are held in custody are released, where appropriate, at the earliest possible date. Ever since the Bail Bill was introduced, Glasgow district court has purported to meet. The clerk has been there; the stipendiary magistrate has been there; the bodies in custody have been there, but the procurator-fiscal has not turned up. The procurators-fiscal have in effect boycotted the court, with the result that we have a ridiculous stalemate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 837</span>
It is a matter of some importance in the running of a district court that it calls in question who is responsible for the district courts. I am sure that the Under-Secretary has given much thought to this—I say it in no sarcastic spirit—because it must be a dispute to which he has had to pay a good deal of attention and in which he must be trying to mediate. I understand that the district council ought to be master of the decision on when its own court meets. The option that the Bail Act gave is to be exercised at the discretion of the district council.<br><br>
Glasgow district council apparently does not have the same enthusiastic wish to save a few pennies, even at the expense of leaving people in custody over the weekend by getting rid of Saturday courts. The council has opted to have those Saturday courts and to hold them and to finance them. It seems to be an extremely dangerous and important principle to know whether it is right that it should be frustrated by the fact that the procurator-fiscal service and the Crown Office for which the Solicitor-General is responsible are not prepared to put on staff from the fiscal's office.<br><br>
This is a matter which raises important issues for a number of individuals. It is too early to pass judgments, but we were assured that the confident expectation of the Government was that very few people would be held in custody and that wherever possible people would be released. It was a way of cutting down the population in custody.<br><br>
5.0 am<br><br>
I would have thought that if there was any area where it ought to be possible to release—and remember that we are talking here about police discretion and, presumably, fiscal's discretion too—it would be in the district courts. After all, they deal with the small change. They deal with the breaches of the peace, the minor malicious mischiefs and the minor thefts. I would think that the number of cases in which it would be necessary to keep someone in custody would be very small indeed. But I am told by those who are in touch with the situation that the average number of people who are being held over the weekend and who have to lie in because the Saturday court is being boycotted by the fiscal service is about 15 and has been as many as 25.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
In other words, a significant number of people are being held in this way. I recognise that it is the great plea of Ministers that they should not be involved in industrial disputes, but I do not really regard this matter as an industrial dispute. It is an impasse about where authority lies and who is responsible for exercising an option that this House in its wisdom—or, in my view, unwisdom—has seen fit to grant.<br><br>
If the Under-Secretary of State wishes to comment on this point, I shall certainly give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is very seriously concerned about this point, but I think that he must appreciate that in view of the snail's progress we are making on a non-contentious clause, it would not be appropriate for me to enter into debate on a matter that does not arise out of the clause or out of any other part of the Bill. I do not question the hon. Gentleman's serious interest in this matter, but given what is clearly now likely to be a very lengthy debate on what is supposed to be a non-contentious clause, it would not be appropriate for me to take up the time of the Committee in dealing with matters that have nothing to do with the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that a very cavalier attitude. I think that this was an excellent opportunity to raise a matter of real interest and importance connected with the administration of district courts. To say that this is a non-controversial clause when in fact, largely at the behest of the Solicitor-General, the Committee on the last Bill had to put up with over 40 columns of debate on a very similar clause—and we are nowhere near that—is a departure from the normal that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pure filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall decide when hon. Members are out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Under-Secretary has had to try to have his cake and eat it. If he accepts that I am genuinely concerned, it seems a little hard to say that I am purely filibustering. I would have thought that genuine concern would exclude filibustering. I can assure the Under-Secretary that I am not filibustering. If he wants me to filibuster, I can assure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
him that I have a long and a clacking tongue, but I have no intention of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that this is an important point and that the hon. Member is genuinely concerned, but he must keep to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are to have such an unhelpful reception from the Minister, I will not batter at a closed door, oaken and brass bound against all sense. I merely give notice that I shall find other ways of pursuing what is a matter of real public interest and importance.<br><br>
I think that at this stage I shall leave the debate to others. I have indicated that I believe that there is a case for more use to be made of the district courts, but it must be a use that reflects the changing balance to which I have referred. I hope that the Minister will accept that that argument is relevant, and that he will be prepared to respond to it and, I hope, to distance himself from some of the more extravagant utterances of the Solicitor-General in his Opposition incarnation, but still to give us some interesting insights into the present Administration's thoughts about the development of the district courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can think of no better time than dawn—which happened exactly 16 minutes ago, according to last night's evening paper—to get up and speak.<br><br>
I am reluctant to join in a debate which is basically about whether or not there should be any lay element in the court system. I am reluctant to enter into a debate about the legal closed shop, as it is called. I have to be careful about my hon and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I have my hon. Friends who are advocates—I believe that they are not "learned"—and goodness knows what one calls solicitors such as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar): perhaps "hon. and talkative".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Boring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Boring, my hon. and learned Friend says. He is "learned", so perhaps there is something in that.<br><br>
I would not be too uncharitable to the lawyers about whether they have a closed shop. My profession, too, operates a fairly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
effective closed shop, in that one cannot teach in Scotland without being registered with the GTC. Some of the teachers' unions get very upset about people who run playgroups for the under-fives, saying that people not registered with the GTC—who are just mothers—have no qualifications for doing that job. I may be tripping into a similar debate about the legal world, where some lawyers feel that there should not be lay magistrates because we would be far better off with professional lawyers right down to the bottom of the courts system.<br><br>
I read, with some horror, the report to us of the British Association of Social Workers, which spoke of the appalling quality of justice which obtains in the district courts. It did not spell out what was meant by that or give evidence for it but, at least as regards the district courts in Argyll, I believe that judgment to be harsh and ill-founded.<br><br>
I sat in the district court in Oban for some years and, before that, I sat in the justice of the peace court. I shall come back to some of the changes that have taken place over those years, which I think are important.<br><br>
I was reading the debates on the previous Bill, and I echo what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"when this debate started on Tuesday, I had a horrible feeling that it would develop into an attack on the district courts, their powers, their competence and their ability. I am much relieved this morning that the debate has not developed along that line."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1979; c. 320.]</p></blockquote>
I am equally relieved, because the hon. Member for Garscadden raised valid points but did not indulge in a real attack on lay magistrates. One waits in some trepidation for what may come later but, for the moment, I can echo what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said.<br><br>
An important fact that perhaps the social workers do not appreciate—and the hon. Member for Garscadden recognised its importance—is that the people who sit on district courts, especially in rural areas, have a good knowledge of the people who come before them. Very few of those who come before a lay magistrate are quite unknown to him—their background, their problems and their condition. I am sure that that is one reason why the social workers feel left out of the district courts—that, by and large, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
justices know more about the people involved than some young social worker who is doing a one-off report and knows little about the background.<br><br>
Of course, the district court may not always be perfect. But there are appeals from the sheriff court that succeed. There are even appeals from the High Court that succeed. That suggests that the justice meted out in the sheriff court and the High Court is not always absolutely perfect.<br><br>
I return to my earlier point. Over the years, there have been important changes. When I was first appointed a justice, one was simply given a book to read and asked to turn up when it was one's turn on the rota. One sat there and muddled one's way through. If one was lucky, one went along and listened to a colleague a month or two before. The second time that I took the Bench, a new justice came to listen to me, which I thought was the blind leading the blind with a vengeance.<br><br>
But, now, there is a quite highly developed and developing system of training. A new justice is not allowed to sit on the Bench until he has been on training courses. Justices who decided to stay on the Bench were asked to attend the training courses, and those who did not were asked not to sit again until they had done so.<br><br>
I can speak only for Argyll and Bute, but I am sure that justices in the rest of Scotland—both those appointed for their political colour, or an increasing number who are not appointed for that reason—take the training very seriously indeed.<br><br>
They are well aware of two important things. One is the way that they conduct the court and the procedure that they have to undertake, especially in trials, where they have to obey the court procedures, rules and regulations. They are also well aware of the problem of sentencing. It is not only in the district courts that there is a problem about uniform sentencing. It is also a problem in the sheriff court and the High Court. I assure the Committee that justices are aware of the problem and attempt to see that different courts and different justices mete out related sentences.<br><br>
I should like to say a few words about whether a justice should sit with an assessor. I noted with interest the example cited on the previous Bill by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
suggested that a legal assessor sitting beside the justice and separate from the clerk sitting in front of him was akin to a non-medical person doing an operation with a surgeon beside him. He suggested that if we did not have confidence m the justice originally, we would have no greater confidence if he had a professional advisor suggesting where he should put the scalpel.<br><br>
If we are to move along that line, we should move towards the professional bench. If we do that, I would ask my hon. Friend to tell us, when he replies, where he will get the people to man benches in the future? If one takes away all the lay magistrates, is there a queue of solicitors all waiting to be cushily put up for the bench? There will be few solicitors left—if the hon. Member for Garscadden is correct—to do the work down in front. I am appalled to know that there are so many solicitors wanting to go up on to the bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the rural areas I think that there would be a severe problem. We should only remove the lay element from the bottom rung of the judiciary after great thought. It might divorce the judiciary from the public at that very local level. The crimes that come before the district court are not serious with a capital S. They are minor crimes, and it would be an unfortunate step if we elevated those minor crimes so that they all had to go before the sheriff or a similar professional court.<br><br>
If I had been concerned with the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill in the previous Parliament, I would have found the comments my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland not entirely to my liking. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Rifkind) will reply to this debate so obviously he will not take the same line—and I hope that he will not.<br><br>
I kept my few remarks until I was sure that the sun has—I am quite sure—risen. I can sit down in safety knowing that I have ventured into the waters of the Committee. I would say to those who will perhaps speak, after me that if they attack the system, they should remember that the people who make the system work, whether or not they are party political people, know that they are doing a serious and responsible job, and I assure the Committee that all those that I know attempt to ensure that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
carry out the court procedure correctly and do their sentencing wisely and sensibly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not particularly easy to speak at this hour of the day. I congratulate the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Maiden speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to be so unkind as to say that it was a maiden speech. It certainly was a brisk speech, which demonstrates the considerable merit of rest beforehand. He had six weeks rest beforehand in this Committee and therefore came fresh to us at 5 am. I do not hope to achieve his eloquence because, like my colleagues on the Opposition Benches, I have been working hard on the Bill and frequently contributing to our deliberations.<br><br>
5.15 am<br><br>
First—I think that this will please the hon. Member for Argyll—I shall not attack the present system. I think that it has considerable strength and that district courts enjoy much more respect than is sometimes supposed, although I can well understand the misgivings which certain members of the legal profession may have when they look at the operation of these courts and make their own assessment from a professional standpoint. But, given that these courts enjoy a considerable degree of respect within the community, I am happy that the system is to continue.<br><br>
I refer to the statement made by the British Association of Social Workers. Because the hon. Member for Argyll did not do justice to what the Association said, I believe that it should be placed on record. The statement said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These proposals are of major significance, chiefly because of the appalling quality of justice which obtains in these courts."</p></blockquote>
That was as far as the hon. Member for Argyll went. But the report continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"There will be implications for the amount of our work which may now be heard in these courts, for the whole nature of our relationship with them, for the detail of the cover we provide for them, and, of course, for the added pressures we may receive from the councillors who sit as Justices in these courts. There is an urgent need for the introduction of more sophisticated training for Justices, especially in sentencing powers and provisions, with better guidance in the use of social enquiry reports and the need to 'see cases through' the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
District Court process. Some consideration might also be given to more stringent assessment and evaluation of the work of Justices in the District Courts."</p></blockquote>
That was the total statement. Although I do not like the statement about the appalling quality of justice, and I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Argyll that that accusation is not substantiated in the BASW document, none the less the association makes some useful observations.<br><br>
It does not help the cause of defending the existing system of district courts for the hon. Member for Argyll to attack social workers. Unfortunately, that is a frequent practice of hon. Members on the Government Benches. Indeed, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) deserted us some hours ago, because he has a track record of attacks upon social workers. I am sorry that he has been joined in that by the hon. Member for Argyll. What he said about a young social worker making a one-off report in the district court, compared with the community experience and background of the magistrate, was a most unfair criticism and was most unkind to social workers, many of whom have to work against a background of extreme difficulty.<br><br>
Many of them now have considerable expertise in court reporting procedures, especially since we introduced the generic social worker. What is more, they are highly qualified and have to undergo extensive training. That is not the kind of training to which the hon. Member for Argyll referred on two occasions when he spoke on the issue of training for justices. I think that he is being very unfair to social workers, and I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Armstrong, for taking time to offer a defence of a profession which I consider contributes greatly to our society, does a very useful job and deserves the support of people in public life, not criticism.<br><br>
I move on to say why I believe the district courts are important. I believe that they provide a link with the whole judicial process which has that essential democratic connection missing elsewhere in an institution, if I am expressing it correctly, that has separate powers within the framework of our society. As I understand it, the law operates on its own. It is independent within our society. But there is one link with the democratic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0520">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 845</span>
process, which is at the lower court level, and I believe that to be worth defending.<br><br>
It is possible for all of us to recount a story of something that a magistrate has said in court—I am sure that that will happen in the course of our discussions—which is immensely funny and in some way undermines the authority of these courts. There is no doubt that we can all do that. All of us in political life have our favourite story about a bailie. I shall not tell the Committee my favourite story, but they generally do a very good job and there is little criticism of them. When one considers the total number of cases processed in these courts every day across the whole of Scotland, there is not an extensive criticism of what they are doing. Therefore, overall they do a good job.<br><br>
But I want to come to the point about the use of legally-qualified assessors. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) withdrew his amendment, because I thought that it was a useful proposal. What I put forward is only an opinion, based on reading newspapers as opposed to court reports. I stress that point. As a layman I gather my information from the media rather than from the court reports. Even if very few mistakes are made, it is important that we should do everything possible to strengthen the quality of these courts. If we introduced that professional element, it would be very helpful. It would avoid the occasional excess in sentencing which finds its way into the newspapers and then has to be undone, and would avoid or go a long way towards avoiding the mistake which might even be a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, it is worthwhile.<br><br>
I think that the city of Glasgow was right to introduce stipendiary magistrates. I would like to see that practice extended to our large cities, where the courts are immensely busy. But I accept the point that there is a strong case for maintaining the present position in other communities. That is why I have defended the district courts this morning.<br><br>
I hope that, notwithstanding what is decided here today, we shall continue to examine the practice and record of the district courts in Scotland. I hope that we will return to this issue in the House in future, because my interest in things legal has been briefly stimulated by the Committee and I shall take an interest in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
where we go in the future. I hope that we have many more sittings such as those that we have had today, because I have found that I am very fresh at 5 o'clock in the morning. I never knew that before. Now that I have discovered this great inner strength, I intend to bring it into play on many occasions in the future. I look forward to having many such sittings with you, Mr. Armstrong. I sincerely hope that we shall not hear further attacks on our professions such as we have heard today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Except lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It has been reasonable since Shakespearean times to attack lawyers. But when we have school teachers attacking social workers and talking about closed shops and so on, it is unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stones and glass houses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I hope that those attacks will not be repeated. Otherwise, we have had a useful debate about the functions and working of the district courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I knew my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) well, until the last few moments of his speech. Suddenly I discovered that, far from being the charming, balanced, normal person that I thought he was, that he is a masochist and takes delight in our present proceedings.<br><br>
I share some of his knowledge. After this Committee I may consider taking a degree in law and perhaps practising it. I think that I shall know as much about it as many practising lawyers in Scotland by the time that I have finished.<br><br>
I agree with much of what the hon, Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said. I join my hon. Friend in regretting that in what was a good speech in defence of the lay magistrate, the hon. Gentleman should have rather unkindly taken a side swipe at social workers. It was an unnecessary part of the speech and it detracted from the point that he was making.<br><br>
He was making his point from practical experience—he is a justice of the peace and I am not—but I wish to take up the same arguments from a more theoretical point of view.<br><br>
At all levels, possibly in all professions, including the hon. Member's and mine, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0521">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
introduction of lay people is no bad thing, including medicine. I should tell the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) that both he as a father, and his wife as a mother, practice medicine of a basic sort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stick to the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not. I shall make this point, however clumsily. Those of us who are fathers, know that when we have children we practice medicine on our children. If a child falls and cuts his knee, we do not run to the doctor and ask him to put the knee right. We put a plaster on it.<br><br>
We then move up the paramedical scale to the nurse. The doctor is there as the assessor. He is the person who can step in if things go wrong. We allow medicine to be practised by a large number of people, not only doctors and surgeons. But of course for an appendicitis we expect the doctor to be there.<br><br>
In law too, at that level, the lay magistrate knows the community. The problem of the big cities and one of the reasons why stipendiary magistrates have had to be introduced, is that there are not sufficient magistrates courts within the existing communities.<br><br>
Instead of there being smaller numbers of courts in city centres, they were spread out—there could be a magistrates court in Castlemilk with lay magistrates drawn from among the people of Castlemilk—it might be beneficial to the legal system because the magistrates would understand the problems of those coming before them. My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden made the point that in a sense that is not entirely true of the children's panels, but it is partially true. It brings the profession of law nearer to the people. That cannot be a bad thing.<br><br>
What so often happens is that the legal profession attempts to make it a closed shop, to keep it within its own bounds. My hon. Friend for Garscadden was cautious, but he tended to fall towards that trap. There is nothing wrong with closed shops, and there is nothing wrong with the legal profession being concerned about the standards of its profession, but those of us who are not lawyers may always have a slight suspicion that when lawyers seek to put more of the law under their control they are not doing so entirely for altruistic reasons but see a little more reward for their profession.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
5.30 am<br><br>
The fact that increasingly it is lawyers who control the legal profession means that the law becomes more divorced from working-class people. There are not many working-class people who are practising lawyers. Therefore, they feel that the law is increasingly remote from them. But they do not necessarily feel remote from lay magistrates. They may be termed political hacks by the Solicitor-General in his previous incarnation, but I know that within my own political party, and my constituency, people drawn from within the Castlemilk scheme—unfortunately not always practising as JPs within the Castlemilk scheme—are drawn from ordinary working-class people as justices of the peace. Of course, they will make mistakes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East said, we all have our favourite stories. But as I said to him, half-past five in the morning is no time to tell stories and I do not intend to do so.<br><br>
We all have our favourite stories of mistakes that are made. But practising lawyers also make mistakes, and some of those mistakes are far more disastrous than the mistakes made by lay magistrates. The lay magistrate will make a mistake, but at least he is in contact with the people he is dealing with. That is much more important than the few mistakes he may make.<br><br>
I conclude by asking a question. I am perhaps testing the legal brain of the Minister at this time of night. I refer to the £200
<br><blockquote><p>"theft or reset of theft, falsehead"</p></blockquote>
and so on. It is an interesting legal question at this time of the night, and at a time of high inflation, which would matter to some people in some circumstances who were caught and tried.<br><br>
Let us assume that someone stole, say, a painting in 1976 which was valued at that time at £198. In the meanwhile the painter dies. Apparently, art dealers want painters to die, as opposed to publishers who want writers to live, because as soon as a painter dies the value of his work rises and the art dealers start to make their money. The artist dies and the value of the painting rises, but the person who stole it is not caught until 1980. The painting is then worth £500.<br><br>
In which court will that man be tried? Will it be in the district court because the value when the crime was committed was £198, which is below the sum specified, or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0522">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
will it be in the higher court on the basis of the present value? It is a tricky legal point, because the sentence will vary according to which court tries the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long. I shall certainly not follow my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) into the subject of medicine, and even less shall I go into the matter of parenthood. I suspect that the last time my hon. Friend was up at half-past five in the morning was when the baby was crying. This must be a new experience for him.<br><br>
I was the Minister responsible for introducing the legilsation in 1975 that set up district courts in Scotland, and I have waited from then until now to hear the sort of speech that was made by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). When the Labour Government's Bill was debated there was nothing of the vicious attacks on lay magistrates that were heard when district courts were set up. The big change that has come over the scene in relation to such courts is the confidence that more and more people have in their ability to discharge the duties that Parliament has placed on them.<br><br>
I take issue with the Minister when he seems to say that because a clause is non-contentious we should not discuss it. I did not notice on the previous Bill that that was a sign for silence. It is right and proper that we should take the opportunity to place on record our appreciation of the work that is done in district courts by volunteers. Only a third of the courts are made up of locally-elected persons, the other two-thirds are made up of appointees of one sort or another. The hon. Member for Argyll, who has experience in the district courts, said many things that I had hoped to hear since the time that they were set up.<br><br>
I turn to what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said about stipendiary magistrates. If my memory serves me correctly—as he is from Edinburgh, no doubt the Minister will put me right if I am wrong—when the old burgh police courts were in being Edinburgh did not have them but only stipendiary magistrates' court. Although there were stipendiary magistrates in Glasgow, there were also burgh police courts there. However, that has changed since the introduction of district courts; there is now that level of jurisidiction. Is that correct?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 850</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is not correct. My understanding, which is confirmed by my advisers, is that Edinburgh has never had a stipendiary magistrate, even before the new system was introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My memory is that Edinburgh certainly never had burgh police courts. That led me to believe that all cases were taken in the sheriff court. But that is not the point of debate in any event.<br><br>
I wish to consider the slight difference between clause 7 and clause 13 of the Labour Government's Bill. In the previous Bill we included the possibility of district courts dealing with cases of assault in which a limb had been fractured, but in the clause that we are considering at present that has been left out. I realise that it is a matter of balance. To be fair to the Government, in the debates that we had on the Labour Government's Bill it was clear that the Conservatives did not like our including that. They have now taken the chance of leaving it out of their legislation.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I hope that that does not mean that the Government have closed their mind and the Minister will say something about the possibility of extending the type of cases that district courts can take.<br><br>
I am thinking particularly of road traffic offences. I do not suggest that those courts should take a road traffic offence in which disqualification could be involved. Although not necessary involved, disqualification is something that is at the disposal of a sheriff taking a case. I am suggesting that there now appears to be scope for the district courts taking road traffic offences where only an endorsement is involved, for such offences as vehicles being parked within the zig-zags at pedestrian crossings and other cases where an endorsement but not disqualification is involved.<br><br>
As the Government consider the report of the Royal Commission on legal services, they should examine the possibility of a redistribution of the work between the sheriff courts and the district courts. They would be well advised to keep an open mind on the possibility for that sort of road traffic offence going to the district courts.<br><br>
That brings me back to my original point of the way in which confidence in district courts has built up quite dramatically over the past few years. Much of the criticism that was levelled at the district
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0523">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 851</span>
courts, which in my view was unfounded, has disappeared and we do not now hear or read of the sort of situation that occurred from time to time at the beginning, obviously through a lack of experience.<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Argyll paid tribute to the training scheme, and I hope that the Minister will say something about possible developments in the training of lay magistrates. Nothing stands still, and the training programmes that the Labour Government were responsible for introducing are bound to be in need of updating and extending as the work of the district courts becomes more heavily involved.<br><br>
I shall finish by elaborating on what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden about the Act which set up the district courts. My hon. Friend referred to a speech that I made which lasted for one and three-quarter hours. It is a very interesting lesson for any Government Whip or Minister. I well remember that the Committee was tied. Before we lost one or two by-elections, the Labour Goverment actually had a majority for a few short months, and we had a majority of one on the Committee but that one Member was missing. My hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell (Mr. Hamilton), who was a Whip at that time, pushed a note in front of me which said "You will have to speak until I find Harry Selby." I spoke for one and three-quarter hours, and there came my hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell—I can see him yet, coming through the door with Harry Selby. He pushed a note in front of me which said "You are all right now. You can sit down." I sat down, and Harry Selby voted against us. I believe that that is a salutary lesson for any Goverment Whip or Minister, and I end on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'> I shall not seek to continue to speak until my hon. Friends come back, because who knows how they might vote if they were aware of that precedent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked how many stipendiary magistrates there now were. There are only three stipendiaries, all in the city of Glasgow. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and certain other hon. Members asked whether there were any plans to change and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
develop the role of stipendiary magistrates. The Committee will remember that in 1975 when the Bill setting up the district courts was being debated there was controversy over whether there should be lay magistrates or stipendiary magistrates. The matter was fully ventilated at that time, and I freely concede that then I felt, as I feel to a substantial extent at present, that stipendiary magistrates have an important role to play.<br><br>
However, a new system was introduced in 1975, and certainly the Goverment do not feel that it would be appropriate at this stage, which is a relatively short period after the introduction of that system, to embark on any major changes in the relationship between stipendiary and lay magistrates. As hon. Gentlemen have commented, on the whole lay magistrates are performing their responsibilities well and in a creditable fashion. Therefore, there is no argument for any substantial change at present.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked whether there was not a case for extending the powers of the district courts. Indeed, there is such a case. That is what the clause does. One of the main purposes of the clause is that, whereas at the moment only common law offences can be taken at the district court, plus those statutory offences where the statute in question specifically refers to the district court, in future any matter whether common law or statute—even if the statute makes no specific reference to the district court—may be taken there so long as the penalty comes within the maximum of a £200 fine or 60 days.<br><br>
5.45 am<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about road traffic offences. He will see that subsection (2) specifically exempts those road traffic offences in respect of which either disqualification or endorsement might follow from the remit of the district court. It would be fair to say that the general public as a whole would not feel it appropriate that a lay magistrate should be able either to disqualify them or to endorse their licences, which in itself could lead to ultimate disqualification. It seemed appropriate that those matters should be referred to the sheriff, because of the serious consequences for the members of the public who might be affected by these matters.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 853</span>
I hope that these answers have clarified, for the benefit of the Committee, the specific points raised in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely want to add one point. I thought that the Minister might have referred to paragraph (i) of subsection (3), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(iii)"—</p></blockquote>
of the 1975 Act—
<br><blockquote><p>"for the words '£25' there shall be substituted the words'£200'.".</p></blockquote>
That is an enormous jump, by a factor of eight. Is that increase intended to take into recognition the rate of inflation under this Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. One would have to include inflation under the previous Government as well, if that were the criterion being applied. But the increase is also intended to give a wider scope of responsibility to the district court. Clearly, the higher the level of the fine, the greater the number of cases that can properly be put before the court. I should have thought that that would be agreeable to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

CITATION OF DEFENCE WITNESS FOR PRECOGNITION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 182, in page 9, line 16, leave out 'before the sheriff' and insert 'at the sheriff court'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 183, in page 9, line 18, leave out 'on oath'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment, like amendment No. 183, is a probing amendment, but it is an amendment of genuine importance and public interest. It deals with citation of a defence witness for precognition. The amendments were put down because I am genuinely curious to find out exactly how the system will be worked.<br><br>
My curiosity was whetted by the debate in Committee on the Labour Bill, when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 854</span>
Conservative Members and I combined—and might have been seen by the then Lord Advocate as an unholy alliance—aiming to discover what was in the Government's mind. The report of the debate commences at col. 343 of the <i>Official Report</i> and is quite lengthy. I hope that it will not be thought offensive to a much-liked ex-colleague—the then Lord Advocate, now Lord Murray, who, as a man of the people, has dropped his double barrel—if I say that he got himself into what I can only describe as fine fankle in trying to explain exactly what the Government intended.<br><br>
It is clear, in the most general way, what the principle behind the new clause is. Indeed, Lord Murray said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In other words, it"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the parallel clause in the Labour Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"will introduce parity between the two parties to a prosecution in respect of precognition for reluctant witnesses."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 8 February 1979, c. 344.]</p></blockquote>
The intention was that the defence solicitor was to be put on the same footing, in terms of powers to obtain a precognition from a reluctant witness, as the procurator fiscal. That intention was set out in paragraph 17.16 of the Thomson report, which appears on page 91.<br><br>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary will accept that the difficulty is that those were fine statements of intent but that the machinery whereby the intent would be achieved was not so clear to the Committee. One of the recommendations in the Thomson report is in the form of an assertion which has not been backed up by any detailed analysis of how that assertion would be made concrete.<br><br>
The reason why I have suggested tentatively that the words "at the sheriff court" should be inserted in place of "before the sheriff" is that on the face of it—I do the Ministers the credit of thinking that, having been forewarned by the previous debate, they have got this into some sort of order—the substitution of these words allows us to discuss exactly how this measure will be implemented.<br><br>
The point was put by the present Solicitor-General. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am not criticising the Government, but it seems to me that the process has not been well thought out. The clause clearly envisages that this precognition is done in front of the sheriff, because it says:</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
<br><blockquote><p>'where he is before the sheriff … or in any case on summary conviction'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>So it seems to me inevitable that the clause adumbrates two possibilities: one, that a person is before the sheriff, and the other that he is not. Is that the procedure?"—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1979; c. 347.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to ask a number of highly pertinent questions, in which I joined.<br><br>
I think that I can simplify the matter to a large extent by saying that it seems to me that there are two broad possibilities. It is clear from the way in which clause 9 is drafted that the person is still cited
<br><blockquote><p>"to appear before the sheriff in chambers at such time or place as shall be specified in the citation, for precognition on oath by the accused or his solicitor in relation to that offence".</p></blockquote>
I take that to mean that the person who will receive the citation on the authority of the sheriff will appear for precognition by the accused or by his solicitor—more commonly by his solicitor—and that will presumably be done outwith the presence of the sheriff.<br><br>
I see an indication of dissent from the Under-Secretary. In that case, it might be easiest if I let him explain what he means and then comment further, because clearly he is radically departing from what I understood to be in the mind of the last Administration. It is perhaps important that I let the Under-Secretary enlighten the Committee. Then we can clarify and follow up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond at this stage to the points that the hon. Gentleman has made. First, the words in the amendment would not make much difference, because wherever the sheriff sits is, by definition, the sheriff court for the purpose of that sitting. But I appreciate that that was a handle on which to raise the general issue.<br><br>
I cannot speak as to what the previous Goverment had in mind, but with regard to this Goverment and this Bill, where the defence wishes to take a precognition from a prosecution witness, normally one would hope that would be possible without the facilities provided in the Bill. But here we are dealing with a situation which occasionally exists at the moment, where the prosecution witness simply refuses to provide his evidence for the benefit of the defence. We then have this unfair situation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
that, whereas the prosecution can demand statements from defence witnesses, at present there is no similar right for the defence.<br><br>
The intention is that, where this facility is invoked by the defence, if the sheriff is so minded he may require the person to attend in his chambers, as the clause specifically says—
<br><blockquote><p>"before the sheriff in chambers".</p></blockquote>
It would indeed be the intention that the sheriff should be present, apart from anything else to ensure that there is fairness to the witness concerned.<br><br>
Here, by definition the witness is reluctant to give a precognition. If he were willing to do so, there would be no need for the clause in the first place. We are dealing with a situation in which he is reluctant to do so, perhaps for genuine reasons of fear, misapprehension or misunderstanding of what is involved. Therefore it is right and proper to reassure that witness, who will often be an innocent member of the public. Also for the general protection of this policy, the sheriff should be present on what we hope will be the rare occasions when the provision has to be exercised.<br><br>
By providing that the matter should be dealt with in chambers, it will be private and the witness will be able to give his evidence clearly, without fear, and in the knowledge that it is required of him by law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the intention was to put the defence on the same basis as the procurator fiscal. That is certainly not the system that the procurator fiscal uses in terms of precognition. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. The procurator fiscal is in a different position. He is a recognised public figure with whom members of the public will not feel any unnecessary apprehension. They know that he can require them to give their statements and they have no reason to fear the consequences of so doing.<br><br>
The difficulty is that certain persons are often reluctant to give evidence to the defence—either to the accused directly or to his representative—because they fear that they will become involved in what might be a serious crime. They feel that it should not be necessary to associate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 857</span>
themselves with an accused who they believe has done an ill deed to them and of whom they may be frightened. There should be greater protection for innocent members of the public so that we can achieve the proper balance by giving the defence the legitimate information to which it is entitled, but not doing so by a procedure which might cause alarm and concern to a member of the public who is reluctant voluntarily to give the information sought by the defence.<br><br>
Amendment. No. 183 concerns the question of the precognition being taken on oath. That is in order to put the defence on the same basis as the prosecution which is on oath. The clause 'provides that prevarication would be an offence leading to a penalty being imposed. It would be inappropriate for an offence to be established if the information was not to be given on oath. The two necessarily complement each another.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that the clause provides the necessary balance between the interests of the defence and the prosecution while reducing to an absolute minimum any natural alarm of a member of public required to give evidence to an accused person who may be involved in a serious crime, in that the sheriff will be able to provide proper protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a brisk and useful interchange. I congratulate the Minister on producing a neat and consistent solution. It has some disadvantages, but all solutions possibly have disadvantages. It certainly gets over the total confusion that reigned in the previous debate about a possible two-stage operation where an effort was made by the solicitor on his own initiative and then, when he ran into difficulties, the sheriff was whistled up as an equivalent to the heavy squad to deal with the developing situation.<br><br>
My worry, which I am sure the Minister recognises, is that it makes for a very cumbersome situation in which the sheriff will be involved <i>ab initio,</i> from the beginning. It will be a further commitment of shrival time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be reasonable to anticipate that, because it will be known to a member of the public that he can be required to come to the sheriff court to give his statement, it will not be necessary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 858</span>
to invoke this procedure. It could be a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that has some validity. I suppose that frequently solicitors are phoned by those who are reluctant to give statements but who have been approached by precognition clerks. At that stage the honest advice, which I hope is always tendered, is that it is entirely voluntary and that, if the person does not wish to give precognition to the defence, there is no necessity to do so.<br><br>
We shall obviously have to revise that and say that there is no necessity but that, if a person does not do so at the discretion of the sheriff, he may be cited to appear before the sheriff court. In a sense I suppose that would put a good deal of pressure on him. A much larger number may come forward.<br><br>
In the minority of cases where a citation is issued, the sheriff will have to make himself available for the gathering of the information. Presumably he would have a purely watching brief. There will be no recording apart from the recording taken by the solicitor who conducts the precognition. Presumably the sheriff will keep no record of what happens.<br><br>
6 am<br><br>
There may be a little awkwardness in the smaller sheriff courts. It would obviously be inappropriate for the sheriff, who had been present in that capacity at the precognition session, to sit on the bench at the summary trial that followed.<br><br>
The floating sheriff, who is now such a feature of the Scottish legal landscape, may well have to float into that particular sheriff court to obviate that difficulty. I confess that I am not terribly happy about the situation, but it may be the best that can be managed.<br><br>
I hasten to say that the second amendment was a probing amendment based on the mistaken assumption that the Government might be thinking of a two-tier system on the lines of that proposed by the previous Administration. While roving through the Thomson Committee report—unlike my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) I do not refrain from the habit of Thomson watching—I saw in paragraph 17.03 the pregnant sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is illegal for a prosecutor to take sworn precognitions outwith the presence of a magistrate."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0527">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 859</span>
That rather surprises me. In view of what the Under-Secretary said about an oath always being administered when a precognition is taken by a fiscal—and I understand that a fiscal normally takes his precognitions in the presence of a witness, who is a member of the fiscal staff, but not in the presence of a magistrate or a sheriff—I am puzzled by the statement that I read from paragraph 17.03 of the Thomson Committee report. It is a mystery that remains in the back of my mind, and it may be that the Under-Secretary can clear it up quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The oath is required only when the witness whom the Crown wish to precognosce declines to come voluntarily, and the prosecution use its existing legal powers to bring the person before the sheriff in order that a precognition can be taken from him. In those circumstances an oath would be required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Better and better. That is quite neat. We are now being told—and I should like to accept it—that the system is the same on both sides. That explains the mystery.<br><br>
I do not want to be difficult and I certainly do not want to keep this debate going. I thought that it was worth ventilating because of the confusion. I have now had my answers. I think it is a little cumbersome, but that fault is possibly outbalanced by the fact that we now have a consistent and clear picture of how the Government expect it to operate. I accept that it will probably be in exceptional cases only—either for particularly obstinate and difficult key witnesses or in cases of peculiar importance in terms of the offence that has been committed—that this machinery will be called into play. I am glad that I tabled the amendments. I certainly got some enlightenment and help from doing so. I accept the helpful explanations and the spirit in which they were given. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 860</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to thank the Government for seeing fit to extend the legal aid scheme to cover an accused person seeking an identification parade. It would be churlish if I did not acknowledge that the Government had extended the legal aid scheme to cover an accused person purusing an application to hold an identification parade.<br><br>
I shall not make a long speech at this stage, because I recognise that the corresponding clause in the Labour Government's Bill was approved without any discussion. But it would be churlish, even at this early hour, if I did not place on record our appreciation of the fact that the legal aid scheme has been extended in this way.<br><br>
I accept the difference that the sheriff shall order the holding of an identification parade only after the prosecutor has had an opportunity of being heard and then only under the same conditions and circumstances as were defined in clause 17 in the Labour Bill. The difference is that in clause 17 of our Bill there was no mention of the prosecutor having the opportunity to be heard before the sheriff went into all the procedures defined in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). Therefore, I accept that change, too. It seems reasonable that the prosecutor should have an opportunity to be heard before the sheriff takes that consideration much further.<br><br>
With those brief comments, I welcome the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add my congratulations on the fact that the legal aid scheme has been extended to cover a request for an identification parade not only from the defence, but where the identification parade is held at the behest of the prosecution. I know that this has been arranged. I do not want to tempt the Minister, because he might be tempted to give a lengthy reply, to go too deeply into the machinery, but I am not quite clear about the arrangements for finding a duty solicitor.<br><br>
Let us suppose that an identification parade is called by the prosecutor for the Crown and that it is in a police station at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock at night and the police are told by the suspect that he has no solicitor of his own. I am not quite clear about the provisions for getting a duty legal aid solicitor. Is it necessary to phone round, or will there be a roster? Has this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0528">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 861</span>
matter been discussed in any way with the local legal aid committee? It is a matter of some importance.<br><br>
In my experience, identification parades, for very good reasons—I make no complaint—are often held on Sundays. Certainly, they are held in the evening. On many occasions I have had to turn out during hours which by no stretch of the imagination could be called normal working hours. Quite often I have hung around while stand-ins were found in the street and paid the usual £1 fee. It can be a quite protracted performance.<br><br>
Certainly I echo the words of my hon. Friend, but I consider it important that we should know a little more about where the duty solicitor will be whistled up from and how he will be contacted and selected. I should have thought that it would involve having home telephone numbers. I can see genuine organisational difficulties here. Clearly, the Government have given some thought to them and can no doubt say something about them.<br><br>
Another important change in identification procedure is being introduced which I also welcome. It arose partly from the fear that witnesses were intimidated at the very idea of an identification parade. I have friends—certainly acquaintances—who have found themselves involved in serious crimes as totally innocent bystanders who had an important role to play in identifying that someone was in a certain area at a certain time. Those people have been summoned to an identification parade and have found the prospect extremely frightening.<br><br>
The trial that brought this matter into focus was the now almost legendary Chinese extortion case in Glasgow where one witness was so frightened that he refused to pick out anyone unless he was disguised. It was alleged—I understand that it is true, although I do not know whether the Solicitor-General was involved—that that gentlemen went to a theatrical costumier. The gentleman was small, as are many Chinese, and the only costume available was that of Lenny the Lion. The result was that a trembling and knock-kneed—knock-kneed with fear—Lenny the Lion was ultimately persuaded to inspect the line and put a frightened paw upon the shoulder of one of those in the line. That is perhaps one of the more comic episodes in recent legal history in Scotland, but it underlined dramatically the need to do something to protect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 862</span>
people in such a situation. The Goverments solution, which they have imposed administratively, not by statute—I certainly make no complaint about that—is the one-way screen.<br><br>
I have been involved in such a situation. I made a point of going to a couple of identification parades as a solicitor merely to see how the machinery worked and how the one-way screen operated. I found it totally satisfactory in its primary advantage of allowing an inspection without the fear of the witness being identified as putting a finger on a suspect and unfortunately being open to great pressure before a trial. I strongly welcome the introduction of the one-way screen.<br><br>
One difficulty, however, is that the screen obstructs communication. The accused standing in the line-up, cannot see the person who picks him out. He cannot, therefore, be sure that he is being picked out. He will hear a muffled conversation, and a policeman will hail "The witness is picking out No. 5". He knows that he is No. 5, but he does not see himself pointed out because of the one-way screen. In those circumstances, it is very important—this is recognised; hence the legal aid change—that a solicitor should be there to stand on the witness's side of the screen and see what the witness is doing.<br><br>
I hasten to say that I do not think there would be an abuse of the system in normal circumstances, or perhaps ever, but it ensures that there is no indication from a policeman as to whom the witness ought to pick out. I am not suggesting that that would be a common or, indeed, a likely practice, but it is important that we should exclude any possibility of such a thing happening. In the pre-screen era the suspect had a free field of vision. It is now recognised that it is of fundamental importance that a legal aid solicitor should be present, and that takes me back to the question of machinery.<br><br>
Perhaps, finally, the Under-Secretary would say a word about the screens. I have not had an opportunity of making formal inquiries. How many police stations are now equipped with the screens? When does he expect the main police stations to be equipped? Will he tell us a little about the cost? I promise that I shall make no objection to the cost, but it will be an interesting figure to compare with other projects that may be vying for the attentions of what I know is a limited purse.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 863</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Committee has welcomed the clause. I freely acknowledge that the proposals behind it are not purely the Goverment's thoughts. They have been put forward by representatives of all parties and were, indeed, among the Bryden committee's recommendations.<br><br>
I should deal specifically with the one-way vision screens, which I am pleased to see are particularly welcomed. The Committee will recognise that the provisions in the clause simply represent those recommendations of the Bryden committee that need statutory enforcement. There are, however, a large number of other recommendations, which do not require to be put into statutory form but which will be given to the police, about the conduct of identification parades. The one-way vision screen proposals are included in those recommendations.<br><br>
Clearly, it would be inappropriate to introduce the screens until the legal aid arrangements had been approved by Parliament. Otherwise, as the hon. Gentleman recognised, the protection would not be available. It is therefore the intention that if and when these provisions are approved by Parliament, the new rules for identification parades will be published shortly afterwards. It will then be possible to introduce the one-way vision screens without significant delay.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the problem of getting a duty solicitor for parades at difficult times. Whatever form of identification parade is provided—whether at the request of the prosecution or the defence—it will rarely be held at once. Normally, if there were a problem about having a solicitor present, the parade could be deferred until it was possible. I understand that even in urgent cases the duty roster will normally include the names of solicitors who can, for example, visit an accused person in custody. They, too, can use the legal aid provisions to be present at an identification parade. The problem arises only when for some reason the parade has to be held urgently. Even then, experience hitherto does not suggest that it will be difficult to find a solicitor who will be able to carry out that function and protect the interests of the suspect.<br><br>
6.15 am<br><br>
The proposals will mean a substantial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 864</span>
improvement in the rights of accused persons, and I know that they have been welcomed by the Opposition. I am glad that the clause, which deals with certain statutory requirements, is also acceptable to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like most hon. Members I welcome these provisions. There is a good deal of anxiety about the process of identification dating back into the past. Undoubtedly the Bryden report has been helpful in that respect. However, I wish to raise one or two points about the clause. Indeed, perhaps we should have been considering amendments to it.<br><br>
The clause is intended to assist the accused. We should therefore make sure that is done as fully as possible. I question, for example, whether the word "may" in the first line of subsection (1) should be replaced by the word "shall". If we accept that the accused should feel that an objective decision has been made about identification, is there any reason why he should not have a straightforward right rather than merely having a right to apply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will see that subsection (1) is subject to subsection (2). That provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff shall make an order in accordance with subsection (1) above only after giving the prosecutor an opportunity to be heard and only if"</p></blockquote>
certain criteria are satisfied. However, if the criteria are satisfied, the sheriff has no choice in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I read the clause too quickly, underlined "may", and passed on. The Under-Secretary is quite right.<br><br>
I now wish to talk about the three conditions in subsection (2). I do not know how many hon. Members have seen the extremely interesting comments of the National Council for Civil Liberties on the subject. The council points out a problem relating to the time factor. If there is a long delay before the prosecutor decides not to have such a parade and if there is some delay before the sheriff makes up his mind, considerable time can pass between the accused desiring to have the parade and his wish being fulfilled. Speed in such matters is, of course, important, because people forget.<br><br>
I wonder whether a specific time limit should be set by which the prosecutor has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 865</span>
to make up his mind whether to initiate an identification parade. That would speed up the process and enable the accused to initiate an identification parade if the prosecutor were unwilling to ask for one.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the question of who should be on the identification parade. There is often a special defence—incrimination of another person. In that situation it should be open to the accused to seek to have the person he wishes to incriminate also present at the identification parade. Part of the function of such parades should be to give the option to have the person accused by the accused on the parade as well. At the moment I understand that it is the other way round. The prosecution can decide who shall be present. It seems a necessary safeguard for the accused that he should also have a say as to who is in the line-up—including the incriminated person. That would face witnesses with the choice that the accused probably wishes to establish.<br><br>
My third point, which follows on from that, is that, just as the prosecution controls the normal choice of people, however random it may be—it may be totally random—so the defence solicitor should have some say in that choice, in addition to specifying the presence of the incriminated person. He should be able to have some say in the type of person to be included in the line-up.<br><br>
Perhaps we could consider those points before Report and have another look at the representation by the National Council for Civil Liberties—it seems to me to make a great deal of sense—in order to restore the balance of equality of treatment between the prosecution and the accused in respect of identification parades, as has been sought in other parts of the Bill.<br><br>
I do not want to go on to the legal aid matter other than to say how pleased I am at what has been done. There is a general welcome by the Opposition. The extension of the rights of the accused, to try to give full implementation to what was really intended in the report and in the clause, could be examined. Indeed, legislation may not be required. It may be an administrative matter that could be dealt with in another way to bring in extra reforms. I hope that the Minister, who is giving a favourable nod, will consider the issue seriously. Perhaps he would make his nods more audible, because they cannot be reported in <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 866</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to pick up a point that the Under-Secretary made. I do that in a sympathetic spirit. I am not entirely happy with what he said about the locus of the solicitor. Often the police are anxious to carry out identification parades fairly speedily, and there are good reasons for that. For example, they may be worried about tension building up or interference with witnesses. Furthermore, the police do not like holding in police stations witnesses who are to view identification parades but, if they do not do that, the witnesses may be open to pressure.<br><br>
I understand the attitude of the police is "If we are to hold an ID, let us get it done quickly." As I understand the clause 2 detention powers—perhaps the Minister will confirm this briefly in passing—there is no power to hold an identification parade during the six-hour period. Of course, the suspect may co-operate in an identification parade on a voluntary basis. Co-operation is the name of the game.<br><br>
If someone turns up for an ID parade that is voluntary, the police will understandably want to get matters organised before the bloke becomes fed up with hanging around, nervous about the outcome, and decides to disappear in a cloud of dust. Therefore, I think that there will be pressure from the police to have the identification parade more speedily organised than the Under-Secretary led us to believe.<br><br>
Although the Minister has referred to solicitors who are prepared to come out and so on, it will be difficult to organise a roster and to find people at home. The Department's officials should contact the Law Society which, despite the Royal Commission on legal services, is still in control of the administration of legal aid, with a view to holding quick discussions about how the matter can best be organised. Otherwise, I suspect that, as the use of the screens spreads and the pressure of work builds up, we may find ourselves in an impasse with important identification parades not taking place or being delayed to an extent that is embarrassing to the police, because a solicitor has not arrived in time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall examine the points raised by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, to see whether any improvement is required. But I emphasise that only a small proportion of the Bryden
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0531">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 867</span>
recommendations are in the clause. The vast majority of them do not require statutory form. It may be that when the proposals are ultimately published there will be suggestions for improving the recommendations. Of course, that can easily be done without any statutory requirement.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made a point about the police being anxious not to keep people in custody and to have matters dealt with as quickly as possible. He will appreciate that once the one-way vision becomes the normal requirement for an identification parade, the police will be in the position of not being able to carry it out until a solicitor is present to represent the accused's interest. Therefore, there will be every incentive for the police to facilitate the matter.<br><br>
We shall consider whether there is thought to be any serious problem about a solicitor being present on such occasions. Nothing that we have heard so far from the various professional bodies suggests that they believe that to be a problem. However, if we have representations we shall take them on board. Again, no statutory change will be required; merely an administrative mechanism that would cover any problems that are brought to our attention.</span></p>

This is an amendment to section 314 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. It is designed to remove a procedural difficulty which has substantial obligations for the application of the six-month time limit referred to in that section. The amendment is designed to overcome a purely procedural difficulty which emerged in the interpretation of section 314. There is no reason to expect that it will work to the disadvantage of an accused person. The purpose is to provide that the judges' power in section 314 to assign a diet, instead of having to be exercised by the judge personally, may be—not has to be—exercised by a clerk of court.<br><br>
At present, whenever this facility is exercised it is necessary to use the valuable time of the sheriff himself on a matter which may have no element of controversy and which may be generally acceptable. The intention is that without removing in any way the power of the sheriff it will be possible on non-controversial and straightforward matters that the power should be exercisable on his behalf of the clerk of court.<br><br>
I hope that with that explanation the amendment will be acceptable to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 61 in page 72, leave out lines 40 to 44.<br><br>
I am sorry to interrupt the breakneck pace which you, the new hand at the helm, as a good Chairman, Mr. Weatherill, can achieve. In any case I prefer to believe that it is a good Chairman rather than the 12 hours of attrition which we have survived on this Committee.<br><br>
This is an important schedule. I did not rise on clause 12 stand part because I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 869</span>
thought it was better to deal with the points on the schedule. This schedule puts the flesh on the decision in clause 12 to abolish the mandatory first diet in indictment cases of solemn procedure.<br><br>
I am fairly open-minded on this issue. The test will be how it works in practice. It does not raise any great matter of principle, but it is an important procedural change. The schedule sets out in great detail exactly what the new machinery is. I will be coming briefly to the terms of the amendment, but to set the background, it has the provision that, instead of the first mandatory diet, the indictment will be served not less than 29 clear days before any trial diet. The schedule, and the amendment, deal with the machinery where there are preliminary pleas or objections to the competency of the indictment when it is served.<br><br>
The provisions set out that there should be a preliminary diet, when there will be a debate on these matters. That, of course, is what concerns me and is why I tabled the amendment.<br><br>
The effect will be that when a preliminary diet has been ordered the accused, or all the accused, shall attend it. What the Government propose is that the new subsection (6) should go on to the effect that
<br><blockquote><p>"he (or they as the case may be) shall be required at the conclusion thereof to state how he pleads (or they plead) to the indictment:
Provided that if the court so permits the diet may proceed notwithstanding the absence of an accused."</p></blockquote>
7 am<br><br>
There are two points here, though they are not particularly weighty in terms of principle; as I said, this is very much the nuts and bolts and mechanistic infrastructure of the legal system. But I am not clear when we have this preliminary diet which has been interpolated and inserted into the machinery for the specific and limited function of deciding on an argument as to competency or relevancy of the indictment or to raise an objection of that sort, why there should be a requirement that there be a plea immediately that has been decided.<br><br>
Presumably, the implication is that the argument is decided against the accused, because, if it was upheld, there would be no question of asking him to make a plea at that stage. But, assuming that it is thrown out—it may partially succeed or partially fail; whatever be the combination of these circumstances in the event—it appears to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 870</span>
be the Government's intention that at that stage a plea shall be tendered and registered.<br><br>
I suppose it may be argued that this is a convenience, but it seems to me, as this was a preliminary diet for a narrow procedural purpose and the plea would not have been tendered in the normal course of events till a later date, that there is some advantage in treating the tendering of the plea on that same basis, unless, of course, arrangements have been made, which presumably can be made in other ways, to do so at that stage.<br><br>
I certainly do not believe that it should be mandatory as suggested by the Government in the schedule as drafted. I would much prefer that the preliminary diet should be seen as exclusively dedicated, if I may put it in that way—if something as dry, arcane and uninteresting as this piece of mechanism can be dedicated—to the narrow purpose for which it was intended, which is settling those matters relating to competency or relevancy which are being debated on that occasion.<br><br>
The subsidiary point is that the new subsection (6) ends with two slightly more sinister lines, which are not quite so technical:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that if the court so permits the diet may proceed notwithstanding the absence of an accused."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that the Government will again argue that in the first diet as presently constituted there is a rather anomalous position in which, if the accused does not bother to turn up even if he has no very good excuse, there is nothing the court can do except continue the matter to a second diet.<br><br>
I agree that those are slightly farcical proceedings, and it is one of the powerful reasons why the mandatory first diet is being abolished under the schedule and clause 12, which is the trigger clause for the schedule.<br><br>
That seems to be an argument for saying that one should apply exactly the same principle to a situation where someone does not turn up for the preliminary diet, which, after all, will be a matter of substance because, presumably, it is a debate on competence and relevancy which affects the whole structure of the indictment and if the plea is sustained the whole edifice raised by the prosecution may well fall to the ground and be impossible to rebuild. So it seems wrong that that should go ahead without the accused being present.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0533">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 871</span>
I put this forward in a slightly tentative fashion, because I recognise that these are matters of balance and technical argument and not of blazing principle and party dispute. I would prefer to see these four lines excised so that we are merely left with the paragraph reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a preliminary diet is ordered the accused shall attend it."</p></blockquote>
Presumably, if he does not attend, the normal penalties for contempt and so on can be invoked. We should not have a situation where a court, perhaps without knowing why the accused has not attended, may decide in a fairly arbitrary way to proceed with the very important debate on these preliminary matters in the absence of the accused.<br><br>
I would certainly like to see the plea tendered in the normal way and not rather lamely, if I may say so, hitched to a procedural happening which is constructed for a very different purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that to see you there, Mr. Weatherill, shaved, washed, spruce and slept, makes me feel rather grubby and unkempt, to say the least. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I thought that I would get a large measure of agreement from the Government Benches for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And unslept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Definitely unslept. If Conservative Members think that I am looking grubby, I can assure them that they are looking exactly the same.<br><br>
I rise to speak on this amendment in some ignorance, because as I read the clause, without my hon. Friend's amendment, the implication of the preliminary diet appears to be a total and utter waste of time. As I read it, whatever happens in this preliminary diet in terms of competency and so on, the second diet will take place. The competency must always be found against the accused. The accused cannot win.<br><br>
The schedule clearly states that at the end of this preliminary diet
<br><blockquote><p>"he … shall be required at the conclusion thereof to state how he pleads".</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that, if the diet had shown that the indictment was incompetent in some way or other, the accused
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 872</span>
person would not have to plead because the whole accusation against him would be dropped. I accept that this may be faulty drafting by the Government's draftsmen. If it is, I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Government that it will be put right. If it stands as it is, it makes nonsense of the whole procedure which the Government are introducing.<br><br>
To some extent my hon. Friend made that point, but I wished to clarify it a little more. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that, only if the purpose of preliminary diet has fallen, will the person have to plead thereafter. Like my hon. Friend, even then I would have some reservations that he should be asked to plead at that point rather than later on when he is going to what I assume is the second diet under this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I dealt first with the point just raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). On the face of it, I can understand his concern, that it appears from a certain reading of the schedule that, even if plea to the competency or relevancy of the indictment were upheld, nevertheless the accused would still be expected to make some plea.<br><br>
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on this point. On the assumption that in a particular case the competency of the indictment has been successfully challenged and the court has ruled that the indictment is incompetent, there no longer is an indictment which the accused or anyone else has to plead to. For all practical purposes the indictment has ceased to exist if it has been found to be incompetent. Therefore, by definition, this can apply only in a case in which, notwithstanding the preliminary hearing, a competent indictment still has to be dealt with.<br><br>
It might be helpful if I explain the reason for the schedule. At present, under existing law, it is always mandatory to have two diets in cases of this kind. In a large proportion of these cases the first diet has become a largely formal occasion when nothing of substance happens. Nevertheless, the parties involved—the court, the accused, the fiscal and so forth—have to go through the motions without any practical benefit. Therefore, it seemed sensible to consider whether it was necessary in all cases to have such a diet. If it has ceased to perform an auto-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 873</span>
matically useful function, clearly it is a waste of time and money to insist on such a diet being held.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise blushing, but the Under-Secretary can save me a little time. The main point of the first diet is to lodge special defences and, normally, a list of prosecution witnesses. I know that in the Bill there are alternative arrangements. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can remind me where they are or indeed of their substance—what the time scale is for the lodging of special defences as the first diet has gone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because in many cases no special defences are lodged or matters of that kind are dealt with at first diet, it would be possible to consider the simple abolition of the first diet altogether. But we were conscious of the fact that there will be occasions when the first diet, in its present form, is useful—for example, including the special defence of alibi and matters of that kind.<br><br>
Therefore, it seemed more appropriate to have a procedure whereby, if the accused had a special defence to lodge or another matter for which the first diet is at present relevant—the letters of special defences, the notice of objection to Crown witnesses, questions of competency and relevancy, objections to the citation, pleas in barred trial, and matters of that kind—if the accused wishes a hearing, he should be permitted to have one. The procedure would be similar to that which exists at present. However, instead of being automatic, the diet would be at the request of the accused. If he makes that request, the matter can be appropriately dealt with.<br><br>
The question of special defences, which the hon. Gentleman asked about, is dealt with in clause 13.<br><br>
I deal now with the specific points in the amendment. The first point would delete the provisions requiring the accused to plead at the conclusion of a preliminary diet. It seems logical that the accused should so plead. We are dealing here with a situation where the whole purpose of the preliminary diet might have been to consider whether there was an indictment to plead to in the first place. If, at the end of the proceedings, the court finds that the indictment is competent or relevant, it is sensible that at that stage, knowing that there is a competent and relevant indictment, the accused should indicate his plea.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 874</span>
As far as I am aware, there is no reason why it should be delayed beyond that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of great principle between us, but in the normal course of events, if there had been no plea to be disposed of in terms of competency or relevancy, presumably the plea would not have been tendered at that stage but would have been tendered at the trial diet.<br><br>
In the real world, where legal aid is sometimes granted late and where preparation is often not completed until very nearly the point of the trial diet, the accused may not be able to tender a plea properly advised at that stage. But in a minority of cases that will arise. That is why it seems that, on balance, it would be better to say "Let it take its normal course and have the preliminary plea disposed of at a special diet and then put in the plea, assuming that there is still an indictment to plead to, in due course, although it had taken a normal course without the preliminary diet."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that the hon. Gentleman has raised. If one did not have the opportunity to plead on this occasion, it would be undesirable from the point of view of the accused. If he wished to use the procedure under section 102 to plead guilty, he might have to wait until the diet of trial before he was able to do so, contrary to his own wishes.<br><br>
However, I shall look at the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised to see whether there are any problems of the kind he has referred to that might be raised and to see what is required to be done. Certainly the objective is to ensure that if the competency and relevancy of an indictment has been upheld, it is right that in normal circumstances that is when the plea should be made.<br><br>
The other point referred to in the amendment concerns the question whether the diet can in any circumstances be allowed to proceed with the permission of the court, notwithstanding the absence of the accused. Clearly, it would be very rare that that would be relevant, but the situation could arise where the accused was ill but where nevertheless there was a technical matter which had to be dealt with by the court and where there was no matter contrary to the interest of the accused in allowing the diet to go ahead.<br><br>
The accused's legal representatives may be happy that, although through illness the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 875</span>
diet would not proceed with the accused present, nevertheless, rather than delay it for weeks, it should be dealt with immediately.<br><br>
The matter is not up to the prosecution; only the court can so decree and it would be very rare for that to happen.<br><br>
However, it seems appropriate that if all the parties were perfectly happy that it should continue in this way, given that what we are concerned with is not the trial itself but simply a technical procedural matter where for genuine reasons the accused were unable to be there, there is no basic reason why that should not be permitted to happen in the way that the clause provides.<br><br>
It is a discretionary matter: it is not up to the prosecution but up to the court. Therefore, we can be assured that it will be handled fairly, reasonably and responsibly.</span></p>
<p>7.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two brief points on the Minister's comments. First, while I accept his assurance about the way in which this part of the schedule is worded—I believe that every member of the Committee, after the long night of dealing with legal phraseology, probably understands it fully, too—I must point out that the Bill, when it is an Act, will be read and interpreted by people outside. I hope that the Minister and his advisers will at least look at the wording to see whether it could be tidied up a little and made a little clearer, so that it means exactly what the Minister said that it meant.<br><br>
Secondly, it seems from his explanation of the last sentence—
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that if the court so permits the diet may proceed notwithstanding the absence of an accused"—</p></blockquote>
that this would occur, in essence, only where the accused was absent for genuine reasons—because it was a purely technical matter, raised perhaps by his lawyer and there was no need for the accused to be present.<br><br>
Those were the explanations given, but, if that is the case, I certainly—I do not know about my hon. Friend—should like to see that sentence reworded to make that point clear. In other words, the diet would take place in the absence of the accused only with the consent of the accused and his solicitor. It would have to be postponed if either the solicitor, or the accused him-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 876</span>
self, protested and said "We do not wish it to proceed without us."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the vast majority of cases, when the power was used, it would be a question whether the accused had given his consent. I should not, however, wish to exclude the rare possibility that that might not be the case. For example, a preliminary diet might have been fixed and it might be grossly inconvenient to put it off, but the accused might suddenly have disappeared. It might be a purely technical matter, of the kinds provided for here—for example, if the preliminary diet were for giving notice of a special defence.<br><br>
If the diet had been fixed and, for some curious reason, the accused did not turn up, and if the solicitor were present and could inform the court that he wished, on behalf of his client, to give notice of a special defence, the solicitor might not be able to say specifically that the accused consented to the diet in his absence, but that would be a technical situation where it would be clearly absurd if the diet had to be postponed for no good reason.<br><br>
I do not seriously believe that the court would ever remotely consider having a diet in the absence of the accused if that could in any way be seen to be against the interest of the accused. The court is there to act as an impartial referee. That is its whole function.<br><br>
It would be quite different if the prosecutor could insist on such a power at his discretion, but I have no reason to believe that the court would wish to use such a power often or in any but the most reasonable of circumstances which people generally would accept as sensible. It is for such circumstances that the power is provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, this has been a necessary little technical airing of points, but not a matter on which we wish to go to war. My only point in conclusion is that I am a little puzzled by what the Under-Secretary has said about special defences. He seemed to imply, in his last remarks, that the lodging of a special defence might be the cause of a preliminary diet.<br><br>
But, under clause 13—to which we shall undoubtedly come in a short time—that will be done 10 days in advance of the trial diet, presumably by delivery: by the well-known scientific marvel of sending one's apprentice trotting to the sheriff clerk's department to lodge same. I cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 877</span>
really see why the example that the Under-Secretary gave of a preliminary diet in the absence of an accused could possibly involve special defences.<br><br>
I see that the Under-Secretary is nodding agreement. I know that all our senses are at present a little dulled, and the occasional slip is a pleasant and reassuring evidence of humanity, which I am glad to recognise.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary, in the new spirit of compromise that is ruling, used the magic words that at least he was prepared to see whether there were problems. Those are words that have a certain novelty value. I am a conservative in these matters, and I should not like to suggest intransigence, but their novelty has quite charmed me. In view of them, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 73, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) A hearing for any such application under subsection (1) above shall be intimated by the sheriff clerk to all the parties and the court'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 63, in page 73, line 48, after 'parties', insert 'represented'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments will take only minutes to discuss. Shortly, we are coming to some substantial amendments. The next group will delay us for some time, I think. However, these are probing amendments. I would describe them as clarification amendments. I shall listen to the Minister and I may recognise that my worries are entirely misplaced.<br><br>
The amendments refer to subsection (7), which deals with the proposed section 77A to the 1975 Act. The Committee will see that this presupposes:
<br><blockquote><p>"At any time before the trial diet, a party may apply to the court before which the trial is to take place for postponement of the trial diet."</p></blockquote>
That is a necessary provision, of course. By and large, the machinery is extremely sensible and is outlined in the subsequent clauses.<br><br>
However, I am not entirely clear about the means of communication. That is why I put down the amendment. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A hearing for any such application under subsection (1) above shall be intimated by the sheriff clerk to all the parties and the court".</p></blockquote>
Presumably, the party, when he applies,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 878</span>
will give his application to the sheriff clerk. There is no spelt-out machinery as to whose duty it is to intimate it to the other interested parties. It might be convenient for the sheriff clerk to take that responsibility, particularly as he lives—if I may put it rather inelegantly—cheek by jowl with the fiscal. They share the same roof and that might be the easiest thing for him to do.<br><br>
But there is the problem of the co-accused who might have an interest in the matter and might be separately represented. There would be a little bother and administrative hassle in making sure that the intimation of the diet, once it has been fixed, was properly circulated to all the possibly interested parties.<br><br>
It is worth finding out from the Minister whether that will fall on the applicant, which would be a plausible, although not a preferable, suggestion, or whether it should fall on the sheriff clerk as I am suggesting. If it does it might be better if it were spelt out.<br><br>
The second amendment is even more minor. It is so minor that it is unnoticeable. It merely would amend the Bill to read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (3) below, after hearing all the parties represented, the court may discharge the trial diet".</p></blockquote>
The Minister is keen to make provision for circumstances in which people do not turn up. The amendment would prevent us from being caught with an inflexible form of words which suggests that it is impossible to discharge the trial diet until all the parties involved in the case have been heard. By inserting the word "represented" we should make it clear that, if one does not bother to turn up at the diet where the application is being heard, one loses the right to be consulted and the court's decision will be based on the representations of those parties who are present.<br><br>
Both amendments are self-explanatory. I hope that they both tidy up the Bill in a sensible way. I consider that they would be better in the Bill. Unless the Minister can show that they are redundant and reassure me that the points are adequately covered I hope that he will look at them sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 62 would provide that intimation of a hearing for any application for postponement of a trial diet shall be intimated by the sheriff clerk to all parties and to the court. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 879</span>
Dewar) will be aware, at present a party to the case who wishes to have the diet postponed may apply through the clerk for a hearing to postpone the trial. Normally the clerk would then attach an interlocutor to the application fixing the hearing and authorising the applicant to intimate it on behalf of the court to the other parties. That is the system that works at the present time and I am informed that it works perfectly well without any particular problem.<br><br>
If, at the subsequent hearing, one of the parties had not turned up, clearly the court would want some reassurance from the applicant that he had so intimated to the other parties. For example, a recorded delivery certificate is one means that is sometimes used to provide information of this kind. If we were to impose this burden on the sheriff clerk, not only would we be replacing a system which seems to work perfectly well now, but clearly there would be resource implications for the courts themselves because they would have to provide the means and the method of intimating this information.<br><br>
If the applicant is the person who seeks the postponement, the onus should be upon him to intimate it to the other parties. As the system works well now, I am sure that hon. Gentlemen will agree that it is not necessary to change it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 63 would provide that the sheriff would hear only those parties represented before allowing postponement of trial. I take the hon. Member's point, but he may now realise the practical problem that his amendment would exclude those parties who had chosen not to be represented from being heard by the sheriff, because, technically, they would not be parties represented. We shall consider the hon. Gentlemen's general point, but for the reasons that I have given, we cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to have reached the happy conclusion that both our forms of words are wrong. That seems to be highly likely. On amendment No. 65, which concerns a minor matter, I should be happy to leave it to the Minister to consider. I agree that my form of words is defective and I should not want to proceed with the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 62 is more substantial. I have been slightly intrigued. If I were in a malicious mood—I assure the Committee I am not—I could go on for some time on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 880</span>
this interesting procedural point. But it would try patience beyond reason and possibly beyond endurance.<br><br>
However, I am not clear what the Minister is referring to when he says that this is a well-tried mechanism. There are a number of occasions, particularly in civil procedure, in which solicitors have to intimate to other parties in an action—for example, in enrolling a motion to reawaken a cause, the person lodging the application must serve it upon the representative or the party on the other side.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General, with his usual trenchant wit—I hope that he will see no sarcasm in that phrase—is pointing out that re-awakening a cause is peculiarly appropriate to the state of the Conservative Benches at the moment. I do not make that criticism of the Conservative Members in the Committee, but the Conservative Party generally.<br><br>
There are precedents of which I can think in civil procedure but I am genuinely puzzled—no doubt the Minister will be able to help me—about what he refers to in terms of criminal procedure. This cannot be a well-tried mechanism because it is a new procedure altogether. Schedule 4 introduces a new concept to replace the old mandatory first diet. Therefore, there is no experience of the machinery in this context. I cannot think of any precedent in another context in criminal law.<br><br>
Of course there is a duty to cite one's own defence witnesses, but that is not exactly analgous to the situation in which the solicitor will have to intimate to the co-accused, the co-accused's representatives, the sheriff clerks and the fiscal, the fact that he is making an application of the kind that we are discussing.<br><br>
This is a minor administrative burden, but it is slightly compounded by the fact that the solicitor may not know who the co-accused's representatives are, or, if he has no solicitor, where the co-accused can be found. That information is likely to be available to the sheriff clerk. To that extent, I should have thought it marginally more convenient that the duty fall upon the sheriff clerk.<br><br>
I do not want to force the amendment to a Division. I do not want to do anything to disturb the Committee at this stage, but there is a point of minor substance. I drafted the amendment as a means of obtaining clarification. I assumed that the duty fell upon the sheriff clerk and I thought that it was worth specifically
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 881</span>
stating that. I am a little surprised to discover that I was wrong and that it is envisaged that it should fall upon the solicitor. My confusion perhaps underlines the need for clarification in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will, but not with easy flippancy and in a cursory fashion, undertake to reconsider the problem and consider whether it would not be more convenient for the sheriff clerk, who is in the same building as the fiscal and is one of those to whom it has to be intimated and who will have all the information about the co-accused, his representation, and so on, to intimate the diet rather than borrow from what would be civil procedure and place the onus upon the applicant's solicitor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood, and I am informed, that, under existing criminal procedure, if one of the parties requires an extension, he will be required to intimate that to the other party. I believe that a similar procedure applies with bills of suspension. I had perhaps slightly misled the Committee earlier in that I had said that it would authorise the applicant. It does more than that. It requires the applicant to intimate it to the other parties. I am assured that this exists in criminal procedure at present and that it works perfectly satisfactorily and has not led to the problems that the hon. Gentleman has indicated. That being so, it does not seem necessary to have a new procedure for this form of extension as provided in Schedule 4.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>The maximum period of imprisonment which can be imposed on an accused in the Sheriff Court on any one indictment shall be increased from two to three years".'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been ploughing a lonely furrow during the last few minutes through some fairly technical and, perhaps, minor points. I am glad to reassure members of the Committee—who, I am sure, have been waiting patiently for redder meat—that I regard these amendments as of considerably more substance. I hope that we shall now have a slightly more wide-ranging debate into which some of my hon. Friends may be tempted to enter.<br><br>
These are, in a sense, competing amendments. They are alternative solutions to the same problem. It may be helpful to the Committee if I briefly explain my understanding of the present law. I say that with a little diffidence, because I recognise that this is a subject on which I may have made mistakes and may be suffering from a misapprehension, but I am fairly confident in saying that there is a real problem connected with a sheriff's power to remit for sentence to the High Court.<br><br>
In Scotland, the maximum sentence of imprisonment on indictment which can be imposed in the sheriff court is two years. Unfortunately, it often happens that, an accused person having been found guilty in the sheriff court, the sheriff has to decide whether the two years that he can impose is sufficient to mark the gravity of the events and reflect the requirements of public policy.<br><br>
It might be argued that that ought to be a judgment that, to some extent, the fiscal has already made, in the sense that the decision whether the case goes on indictment to the sheriff and jury trial or to the High Court will to some extent reflect the Crown Office view or the fiscal's view about the likely sentence, if there is a finding of guilt.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 883</span>
But the view of the fiscal or the Crown Office is of no import against that of the sheriff. I accept that under the present law there will always be marginal cases in which, once the jury has brought in the fatal verdict of guilty, there will be a real question in the sheriff's mind whether two years is sufficient or whether a remit to the High court is necessary.<br><br>
That problem is often anxiously canvassed. On numerous occasions, I myself have set about the—with the best will in the world—rather difficult task of persuading a sheriff that he ought to impose a two-year sentence and not remit. Once a case is remitted, a supposition is created—indeed, an irrebuttable presumption—that in the view of the sheriff two years is not enough. The High Court will be likely to take that very much into account when it passes sentence. The remit, therefore, is a matter of real importance.<br><br>
The problem is that one cannot separate co-accused in this respect. That is my understanding of the present law in Scotland. If I am wrong, perhaps the Under-Secretary will shout, or squeak, a protest. I have been personally involved in such cases. The effect is unfortunate. There may be a mature man with a very bad criminal record and a junior accomplice who are on the same indictment. Clearly the degree of culpability or of moral turpitude—if I may use the phraseology that we often hear from the Solicitor-General—is very different. If the younger man with no substantial criminal record were appearing on his own, even charged with the very same offence, he would almost certainly be sent for a period of borstal training.<br><br>
I have a particular case vividly in mind, when the sheriff said that in his view a period of borstal training would be effective, However, because of his horrendous record it was decided that the young man's accomplice had to go to the High Court. Willy nilly such a man drags in his train his co-accused. That seems to me totally unsatisfactory.<br><br>
Although I do not know the details, I accept that when such cases appear before the High Court advice is taken from the judge in the inferior court. No doubt if he strongly felt that a much lighter sentence should be imposed that view would be transmitted to their lordships in the High Court of Justiciary. But for all that it is much better if the person who has heard
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 884</span>
the trial disposes of the case. As the advice from the lower court is given privately and not openly recorded there will always be doubt and confusion about it.<br><br>
I should not like to suggest widespread injustice. However, I can think of cases when the junior partner in a group of co-accused has ended up with a considerably harder sentence because he has appeared in the High Court. There is also considerable stigma attached to a High Court appearance. If through mischance the young man were to sin again after being released, the court would look at his previous convictions when considering sentence and say "You have a bad record. I see"—this is always said, as it were, in capital letters—"that you have already appeared before the High Court." That is a black mark indeed.<br><br>
There is a strong prima facie case for saying that it should be possible to separate co-accused. If the sheriff who has heard the evidence feels that he can dispose of some of them in the lower court, he should do so and remit to the High Court only those with whom he feels that he cannot deal. That would be the effect of amendment No. 64. It is a limited amendment and deals only with the specific problem of separation.<br><br>
New clause 5, which is in a sense an alternative to that amendment, raises slightly wider issues. But it is closely related to the amendments and has very properly been taken with them. It suggests that a remit to the High Court should not be practicable. That is a rather more adventurous suggestion, and I suspect that there may be difficulties about it. However, it is based on the argument on which I have already touched. I believe that justice at one remove is likely to be remote justice. It may therefore err or stray into unsound decisions. There is a strong argument for saying that cases should always be disposed of in the courts in which the evidence has been heard, and where all the circumstances are known to the judge who will be disposing of the case—in this instance the sheriff.<br><br>
As a result of that we may see occasional errors.<br><br>
During a trial in the sheriff court there could be unexpected revelations that would make it look as though the accused should have gone before the High Court. Such a person would have had a stroke of luck, and I can see that there could be some anxiety about that. However, I believe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 885</span>
that by and large we get the division right.<br><br>
I have inserted an important concomitant, subsection (2) of the new clause, which would raise from two to three years the maximum sentence that the sheriff could could impose. I regard this as a bit of a probing runner, if that is not a contradiction in terms. I am not entirely convinced at this stage that new clause 5 is in a fit state to appear on the statute book, but it deals with an issue of importance that should at least be canvassed. It raises important issues.<br><br>
I have seen real distortions that have entered into the system because of the use of a remit to the High Court when it did not seem justified. If it was possible—new clause 5 is an attempt at this—to construct a system which disposed of the power to remit, on the whole that would be an improvement in sentencing policy.<br><br>
I advance new clause 5, therefore, as an object of serious discussion and as a contribution to the debate in an important area. I commend amendment No. 64 to the Committee because it is much more limited in its scope, and I am absolutely certain in my own mind that the right to separate—to deal with one and remit the other—if remission is to survive as a concept is an essential reform within that concept. I certainly hope that the amendment will get, if not immediate endorsement from the Under-Secretary, at least endorsement in principle and a promise that perhaps a more professional and expert form of amendment to achieve the same objective will be brought forward on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has admirably made out the case for this to be dealt with. Amendment No. 64 should perhaps be accepted even as it stands. He has absolutely made out the case on the co-accused problem—the different moral turpitude or measure of guilt.<br><br>
Although I have said that my hon. Friend has made out the case, nevertheless I am anxious about new clause 5. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on this. It is not a party matter. Amendment No. 64 is limited. It deals with the main problem with which my hon. Friend is concerned. It allows one or more, if there are co-accused, to be dealt with in the sheriff court while putting the other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 886</span>
accused up to the High Court. But new clause 5 goes a great deal wider than that.<br><br>
The problem is that the new clause brings in for the sheriff court the three years maximum instead of the present two years. In other words, irrespective of the situation affecting the problem in relation to two or more accused, the new clause asserts in subsection (2) that that shall be a punishment open to any cases taken in the sheriff court.<br><br>
There are two points here. First, it can deal with the co-accused problem where there is a greater measure of guilt. Both can be sentenced by the sheriff court, and my hon. Friend has given good reasons why the sheriff court should do the sentencing. But it has the unfortunate effect of making open for all that which, by definition, refers to a minority of cases where more than one is accused or where, in the course of the actual trial after the indictment has been framed and the evidence brought forward, it is clear that the case should have gone in the first place to the High Court. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said, a person was lucky if he got to the sheriff court rather than to the High Court.<br><br>
However, I do not think that my hon. Friend's argument, which he set out excellently and convincingly in dealing with the minority of cases, is sufficient argument for increasing the maximum period of imprisonment for the sheriff court to a period of three years.<br><br>
Therefore, I endorse what my hon. Friend says in support of amendment No. 64, but I ask the Minister to look a little more carefully at new clause 5 to see whether it can be better framed, recognising that it deals with a minority of cases. I must say that I would oppose it if it were left in its present form.</span></p>
<p>7.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has raised two very important points in amendment No. 64 and new clause 5. Let me say right away that I am not sure whether in new clause 5 my hon. Friend is all that far away from the whole principle of what he is seeking to achieve. He wants the court which takes the trial to pass sentence. Perhaps I am paraphrasing my hon. Friend, but I believe that that is the principle which he is seeking to establish.<br><br>
Amendment No. 64 suggests that when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0541">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 887</span>
a sheriff has perhaps three or four people before him on the same indictment he may consider that three of them, because they have no history of criminal activity, can be dealt with by him but one—who is clearly the ringleader and might have a long criminal record—should be sent to the High Court. At present the sheriff cannot do that; he cannot separate the accused.<br><br>
There have been some cases in which the sheriff has remitted a guilty person to the High Court for sentence and it has been less than the maximum available to the sheriff—namely, two years instead of three, four or five years. I am not saying that such cases have been large in number, but I understand that the most common sentence passed by the High Court is 18 months.<br><br>
That calls into question the use of a sheriff's remitting someone to the High Court. In the sort of case that I have described, the sheriff's purpose is not served.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sheriff was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that the sheriff was wrong. But if the person concerned comes back later on another offence after he has served his sentence—he is a habitual criminal—and the sheriff says to him "I see that you have been before the High Court", that may have an influence on the subsequent sentence.<br><br>
I turn now to new clause 5. Is it a good bargain, in exchange for ending the power of the sheriff to remit people to the High Court in indictment cases—I am not talking about all the cases that go to a sheriff court, but only about those on indictment—to increase the sentence available to the sheriff from two years to three? Having listened to both my hon. Friends in this debate, I am 90 per cent, along the road to accepting the proposition. I believe that it is a marvellous advantage that should not be thrown away lightly. I suggest to the Minister that it would not be a bad bargain to exchange the ending of the sheriff's power to remit people to the High Court for an increase in his sentencing power from two to three years, in indictment cases only. That is an important distinction to make.<br><br>
This problem has been with us for a long time, and my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden deserves the commendation of the Committee for bringing the matter up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 888</span>
at this stage on the schedule. That is very appropriate when schedule 4 introduces a whole host of departures from what has happened in the past. I am not sure whether the Minister should grasp the opportunity given to him by my hon. Friend, and in a sense perhaps I am trying to convince my hon. Friends that new clause 5 is not all that far off the mark. It may be that if the Minister is minded to accept the principle we could come back to the matter on Report with a redrafted new clause.<br><br>
I conclude almost where I began. I honestly believe that we now have a good opportunity to end what is obviously an anomaly—the power of the sheriff to remit, and then, once the person is remitted, the sentence passed is less than that available to the sheriff. I do not believe that that does criminal justice any good. It does the law no good, and it certainly does not do anything to sustain public confidence in the disposal of cases. Therefore, I think that we have an opportunity to create a position where the court taking the case passes the sentence, and I am content to leave the matter there for the time being until I hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with amendment No. 64, which deals with the position of co-accused who are being remitted jointly. This was a point about which the hon. Gentlemen the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke, and I believe the best tiling I can do at this stage is to indicate the existing law. I quote from Lord Wheatley, the Lord Justice Clerk, in the case of H.M. Advocate v. Duffy, reported in <i>Scottish Law Times,</i> 1974, where he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have repeatedly said that when two or more accused appear on the same indictment in the sheriff court and are convicted then the sheriff, if he decided that one of them should be remitted to the High Court for sentence, should remit both or all of them. The purpose of this procedure is to allow the same judge to determine the appropriate sentence for all accused having regard to such relative matters as the number of offences on which each accused has been convicted, previous records, personal circumstances and background. When accused in such circumstances are dealt with in different courts disparities which sometimes create embarrassment are liable to creep in. It is only in exceptional circumstances that this procedure should not be followed. If, for instance, there are two accused and each is convicted of offences not involving the other the sheriff would be entitled to deal with one of them himself while remitting the other to the High Court for sentence, but where both are convicted of the same offence or offences, whether or not they are also convicted of other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0542">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 889</span>
offences not involving the co-accused, then both should be committed to the High Court."</p></blockquote>
Lord Wheatley went on to say—and this is a matter of particular importance—
<br><blockquote><p>"If the sheriff is of the opinion that in the case of one of the accused there are circumstances present which would justify him imposing a sentence within his competence he can refer to these circumstances in his report to the High Court."</p></blockquote><br><br>
Lord Wheatley was stating the situation existing at that time—that there was a permissive power for the sheriff, when remitting to the High Court, to include in his remittal a report giving his reasons for so remitting and, therefore, being able to include in that report an explanation as to why one of the co-accused, who may not have been such a serious offender, was also being remitted.<br><br>
That was a permissive matter, but when the Bill and the schedule were dealt with in another place the Lord Justice Clerk took part in the debate and made the point that the permissive nature of the matter was not entirely satisfactory. An amendment was made, which now appears in the form which the Committee can see. Under paragraph 15 of schedule 4, it will now be a requirement—it is not a permissive matter—that when convicted persons are being remitted to the High Court the sheriff shall
<br><blockquote><p>"append to such interlocutor a note of his reasons for such remit".</p></blockquote><br><br>
So we can now be satisfied that in future, in all cases where a remit is taking place, an explanation will be provided to the High Court as to the reasons for the remit.<br><br>
It therefore follows that, where one of the co-accused has to be remitted because of the seriousness of the background of the other, the sheriff will be not only able but required to indicate the reasons why that co-accused is included in the remit when he would not by himself have been a necessary recipient of such treatment.<br><br>
With the amendment made to the new section 104 in another place, we have a suitable balance. It is deisrable that, if two people have committed the same offence, the same judge should determine the sentence. What hon. Members are rightly concerned about is a co-accused who has been convicted but whose background suggests a lenient sentence, perhaps receiving a heavier sentence through no fault of his own. That is the main point that we are trying to protect against.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 890</span>
I can say with a fair degree of certainty that that problem would not now arise. In all cases, not just some, the sheriff would now be required to show why the co-accused was being remitted to the High Court and that in his view the co-accused was suitable to be dealt with more leniently. This seems a sensible balance between the two legitimate interests that we are all anxious to protect.<br><br>
New clause 5 seeks to prevent remittal to the High Court. It is interesting that on this matter, as on others, different views and emphases have been put forward. Here again, we have to protect a number of potentially conflicting interests. On the one hand, we do not wish to encourage cases to be sent to the High Court simply to ensure that a heavy sentence will be available if the accused is convicted.<br><br>
Clearly, that would impose new and quite unnecessary burdens on the High Court, because the prosecuting authorities would have to speculate as to these matters. At the moment, if they think in general terms that a sentence of under two years is likely to be sufficient, there is no incentive for them even to contemplate letting the matter be dealt with in the High Court. This is one factor that we have to take into account.<br><br>
I note that the new clause proposes as an additional factor increasing the power of the sheriff court to imprisonment for three years. There is no doubt that, if that proposals were implemented, it would deal with some of the cases with which we are concerned. But I can give the Committee some information to show that this would deal only partially with the problem.<br><br>
The Thomson committee gave some figures of the sentences imposed when cases were remitted. The second report of the Thomson committee gives some figures at page 66 which are obviously from some years ago, but they are still relevant to the debate. In 1971, whereas 28 cases that were remitted eventually got a sentence of three years or less, 21 got sentences of more than three years. In 1972, 35 cases which were remitted got sentences under three years but 25 over three years. In 1973, 36 cases got sentences imposed by the High Court of under three years, but 23 got sentences above that, and a considerable number of these were sentences exceeding four years.<br><br>
Thus, almost half the cases remitted to the High Court end up getting sentences imposed of even more than the three years provided for by the new clause. Therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0543">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 891</span>
it seems reasonably certain that, by increasing the sentencing power of the sheriff court, the new clause would deal only partially with the problems that the remit to the High Court is meant to resolve. I understand that there have even been occasions when a sentence of more than seven years has been imposed by the High Court, but such occasions are very rare.<br><br>
It seems that, on balance, it is more appropriate to retain the power of remittal so that, if circumstances develop during the course of the evidence being heard by the court, the matter could then be remitted to the High Court.<br><br>
I take very much the points made by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), who, I thought, put the right emphasis on this matter. But it is necessary not to encourage people to take matters to the High Court simply to keep their options open as to what might be the appropriate sentence at the end of the day. We want wherever possible to allow the lower courts to deal with these matters. But, as long as they have this reserve power, there can be a certainty that the public interest will not be endangered. I hope that that explanation of the present position will be of assistance to the Committee.<br><br>
This is not a black and white case. I do not think that there are overwhelming arguments in one direction and no arguments in the other. I have a great deal of sympathy with the view that, in theory, it is desirable that the court that has heard the evidence should always be the court that imposes the sentence. As a theory, I find it difficult to dispute, but, as we have seen, it can lead to a number of practical consequences that we should not wish to support or encourage. On balance, the existing system, with its defects, seems to be preferable to the alternatives that have so far been suggested.</span></p>
<p>8 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make one comment: I do not think that Lord Wheatley always and necessarily speaks gospel. Leaning on the authority of Lord Wheatley—[<i>Interruption</i>]—I know that he is the father-in-law of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). I did not think that that gentleman should be lost. If there were a tape recorder, it would show that it was meant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 892</span>
ironically.<br><br>
I think that the Minister rested on the authority of Lord Wheatley in saying that those involved in the same crime shall be dealt with together and therefore it would be difficult to separate the two. I do not accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not resting on Lord Wheatley in that sense. I was simply using the quotation from Lord Wheatley to indicate the present state of the law. Lord Wheatley was indicating what the law is. Whether it is desirable is clearly another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I recall correctly the quotation that the Minister gave, I think that he suggested that it was because it was desirable that all the accused should be sentenced by the same person who had seen the entire circumstances. That was not merely a statement of the law but a comment and a commentary upon it. With respect, I do not necessarily accept his authority on that.<br><br>
I think it desirable that this should happen. We are not dealing with a massive number of cases; we are dealing with about 70 cases. It is not a massive number in the course of a year. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) wishes to stick to his amendment. I had hoped that the Minister would say that he was willing to take the amendment and the new clause away and look at them to see whether he could come up with a solution on Report along the lines of amendment No. 64, and containing the objectives of new clause 5, strangely enough. It is close to the right kind of objectives. I object only because of the statutory three years that has been written in. If the Minister would go that far, it would help. If not, it might be worthwhile for the Opposition to indicate our view by voting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This debate has come at the fag end of the sitting and perhaps it is not the time to extend it for an unnaturally long period.<br><br>
I have a good deal of affection for the principle in new clause 5 but, having listened to the arguments, unless the Under-Secretary rescues me by taking up the very fair offer of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), I do not propose to push new clause 5 to a vote. However, unless we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 893</span>
receive some last-minute assurances, I think that amendment No. 64 is worth proceeding with. I shall briefly set out my reasons for saying that.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, although I accept that Lord Wheatley was being called in aid as a definer of the present legal position, the fact that the Under-Secretary drew our attention to a particularly important part of his judgment gave me the impression that he was relying on it as an argument to support his case to some extent.<br><br>
I accept, first, that Lord Wheatley's views must be treated with some respect, and, secondly, that the argument he advances—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I said was that it was not gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall compromise on that. It is not, as the Under-Secretary said, absolutely black and white. There is some virtue in what he said about a group of co-accused being sentenced by the same hand or, perhaps more appropriately, the same mind. But there are compensating disadvantages. It means that all the co-accused are sentenced by a judge who has not heard the trial and who has not been in charge of the investigation that led up to the finding of guilt. I should prefer to stand on the virtue of the trial judge disposing whenever possible.<br><br>
I should prefer the situation envisaged in amendment No. 64 whereby the co-accused, who, in the view of the trial judge, can be disposed of in the sheriff court, should be sentenced there. That seems to be a positive gain and outweighs the advantages of having the accused sentenced at the same time and by the same judge who is sentencing his colleague who is in even greater trouble.<br><br>
I do not think that we should have that uniformity of approach in sentencing at the cost of condemning them all to a situation where they are being, in a sense, sentenced second-hand.<br><br>
I take the point about the report now being mandatory, but I do not like the report very much. It is another secret</span></p>

<p>document. We do not know what is in it. It is not made public, even to the counsel who may be appearing in the High Court. At best, it seems to be a palliative and nothing more. It is an improvement on the previous situation, but to make a bad situation slightly more acceptable is not so satisfactory as to go for a new initiative which radically improves the matter.</p>
<p>We have a duty to consider the person who is going to the High Court as a passenger. A considerable stimga attaches to a High Court appearance. Eighteen months or a year imposed in the High Court, strangely enough, is in my experience much more damaging to a man's record than 18 months or a year imposed in the sheriff court. People rightly take the view that if one has been in the High Court one has done something particularly heinous, and that can have unfair repercussions.</p>
<p>It may seem a small point, but I am aware—as any instructing solicitor will appreciate who has had the misfortune to have clients going to the High Court in circumstances such as we have been discussing—of the considerable tension and anxieity which results during the waiting period. It is not long, but it is extremely worrying, and it is difficult to console people with the news "You are going to the High Court only on a technicality. Don't worry about it. The sheriff will have sent up a note saying that you will not receive a High Court type of sentence." They listen to the chat and gossip about the High Court judge before whom they may be appearing, and so on. I shall not take that line of argument much further, but such worries exist. They really sweat it out in a way that the system should not encourage or institutionalise, as the present system does.</p>
<p>Unless, therefore, the Under-Secretary wishes to intervene with an undertaking to look again at the problem, I propose not to move new clause 5, but I invite my hon. Friends to join me in a Division on amendment No. 64.</p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
WRITTEN NOTICE OF EVIDENCE INCRIMINATING CO-ACCUSED IN SOLEMN PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 12, line 26, leave out from "defence" to "unless' in line 27.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 69, in page 12, line 28, leave out from "defence" to "has" in line 29.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are comparatively minor matters but they are of some interest. It is a case of probing to discover the Government's intentions.<br><br>
Clause 13 is entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Written notice of evidence incriminating co-accused in solemn procedure."</p></blockquote>
I find that a strange rubric to put alongside the clause. I should have thought that it was a matter of written notice of evidence of special defences, not of
<br><blockquote><p>"evidence incriminating co-accused in solemn procedure".</p></blockquote>
It deals with the whole machinery for the lodging of all special defences.<br><br>
I have not tabled an amendment, but I commend to the Solicitor-General, who has been revived for this occasion, that he consider amending the rubric. He may recall that we managed to lose the part of the Bill which dealt with the lodging of special defences. One of the reasons was that we were misled by this inadequate rubric. I am sure that the Solicitor-General will accept that simple drafting point. But a more substantial matter lies behind these amendments, and that is why it has been decided to elevate to a special defence the leading of
<br><blockquote><p>"evidence calculated to exculpate the accused by incriminating a co-accused".</p></blockquote>
I have always understood that, for example, in the law of Scotland—I believe that I understand correctly and that this is the point of the change—there is no need to intimate a special defence of incrimination if the person being incriminated is one's co-accused. It has never
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 896</span>
been right as a special defence and it has always been held as unnecessary.<br><br>
At this stage I shall not do more than ask two simple and direct questions. Will the Solicitor-General do something about the rubric? Will he tell us the mysterious philosophy behind the decision that there must be written intimation 10 clear days before the trial diet that one intends to lead evidence to incriminate a co-accused? I do not see much point in or need for the change. I am not aware of any abuse, anxiety or difficulty that has arisen from the present law of Scotland. At the moment I am inclined to be conservative in the matter. I await with interest what the Solicitor-General has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I have no responsibility for the rubric. The Bill is an amendment to the 1975 Act and that is what the rubric will refer to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a small point. Who is responsible for the rubric, if not the Solicitor-General?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Clerk of Committees is responsible for the rubric. Perhaps I may be advised on the matter. I had always understood, in my sheltered passage through the law, that the rubric was not a matter of legislation and was not the responsibility of Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would that be a point of order, Mr. Weatherill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be a point of order, but I think that I shall have to leave it to the Solicitor-General to explain to the Committees exactly who is responsible. I do not think it is a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will make this explanation. Whoever is responsible will ensure that there is an appropriate rubric which does not mislead people of such naivity as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). It is in its present form because that is the change that it is making. I am glad to have the opportunity to explain the reason for that because it takes up a number of other points that hon. Members made earlier on other clauses.<br><br>
I think that it was the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) who

alleged that he did not believe that I had ever been in a dance hall. Clearly he does not recollect that I was in the case of Her Majesty's Advocate against Lee, appearing on behalf of Mr. Lee with a senior counsel who was forced to withdraw from the case on account of the fact that he failed to put to the co-accused a special defence that he thought and claimed was not a special defence since he did not need to give intimation of it.<br><br>
8.15am<br><br>
I should have thought that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden would have had seared on his soul the case of Lee, which appears on page 155 of the 1968 "Scottish Times." It was certainly seared on my soul. The accused stabbed another man to death with the tail of a steel comb in a dance hall in Dunfermline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But, unless it was the Solicitor-General who stabbed a man with a comb in a dance hall, that does not prove that he has ever been in a dance hall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not prove that I have ever combed my hair either, but the fact is that I went to the dance hall. I used to investigate the locus of a crime. I frequently learned a very great deal that was of use.<br><br>
This is an important matter. It gave rise to grave difficulty in the case of Lee, because it was thought that one did not have to intimate as a special defence to a co-accused the fact that one was going to incriminate or blame him. One has to intimate to anybody else the fact that one is going to incriminate him as a special defence, and there is more reason why one should so intimate to a co-accused.<br><br>
This gave rise to really traumatic difficulties in the case of Lee, from which my nervous system has scarcely recovered. I assure the Committee that it is a sensible, logical reform that one should intimate to a co-accused person that one intends to say "You did not do it, but he did." If one has to intimate that to a citizen who is not in the dock, there is all the more reason why one should do it for a citizen who is in the dock. If one does that, the question of cross-examination and of putting the case to the other person then becomes an obligation of the law of evidence. If one does not do that and it is not a special defence that requires to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 898</span>
intimated in common form with others, difficult evidential doubts arise, as happened in the case of Lee. In my opinion, this is a sensible and humane reform for the protection of any co-accused who may be blamed by his co-accused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the explanation given by the Solicitor-General, but I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who is more learned in the law than I am, will accept it. However, I should have been much happier to accept it if it did not appear to me that the only reason for the clause being in the Bill is that the Solicitor-General's nervous system was dramatically upset in 1968 by one particular case.<br><br>
In making that accusation I may seem to be joking, but I have some reservations about the Committee or the House debating this clause if it is based on only one specific case. I should have been much happier if the Solicitor-General had given other examples as well to make the point. Perhaps he was trying to illustrate the situation from a personal point of view, but it sounded almost like a case of special pleading on his part. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes, as my hon. Friend says, "Fairbairn's revenge" for what happened to him in 1968. I hope that it is more than that and that there are other cases. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will make it clear that there are other examples, that it is not just that his nervous system has been upset and that he is taking his revenge on the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that it is not what has happened to my nervous system or indeed to my senior's nervous system; it is what has happened to Myles, who was the co-accused, because Lee's case, that he had committed the offence, was not put to Myles and it may have been greatly to his prejudice. There have been other cases. It is uncertain whether, if one does not have to intimate to a co-accused, as one does to another citizen who is blamed it amounts to a special defence. There is confusion and doubt whether it has to be put to the co-accused, so that he can say that it is nonsense. The classic case of Lee caused great confusion and, I believe, unfairness in other cases. It is because of fairness to the first co-accused who will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 899</span>
blamed that he should not give his evidence and then discover, when the second accused goes into the box, that he gives a story that the other co-accused had the weapon and used it.<br><br>
Fairness both to the accused and to any other citizen who is to be blamed is the reason for introducing the clause. I believe that it is a most sensible and fair reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have my explanation, I am sorry about the traumatic career of the Solicitor-General. I assure him that my soul has not been seared by his early adventures in court. I have no doubt that the case of Lee, even if I had been in it, would have been difficult, It is not something that we shall quarrel about.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 12, line 32, leave out "having satisfied" and insert "satisfies".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are taking amendment No. 128, in page 12, line 34, leave out from "with" to end of line 35.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be clear that amendment No. 127 is a paving amendment for amendment No. 128. The effect of amendment No. 128 is to remove the words in paragraph (<i>b</i>):
<br><blockquote><p>"such plea or notice has been lodged before the oath is administered to the jury."</p></blockquote>
The point of the probing amendment is to find out why it should not be left to the court to make the decision on subsection (<i>a</i>)—
<br><blockquote><p>"the accused having satisfied the court that there was good reason for paragraph (<i>a</i>) … not being complied with"—</p></blockquote>
instead of adding this rider which would make it mandatory upon the court to discard.<br><br>
A situation could arise in which the special plea could come forward even after the oath had been administered to the jury. I accept that it is unlikely, but it is possible. If so, it would also be extremely difficult for a co-accused. However, it still leaves these things to be decided by the court which will have heard the case. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 900</span>
think that the court should decide. We should not have a mandatory subsection added here. I shall leave it at that. I should like to hear what the Solicitor-General has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can satisfy the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). The law is that permission to lodge a special defence late can be given up to two days before the trial diet. The special defence should be lodged at the latest at the pleading diet, which at present is normally 10 days before the trial diet. However, if a special defence is lodged two days before the trial diet, it may be accepted at the discretion of the court on a motion at the trial diet.<br><br>
The new proposals must be seen against the background of the fact that we have greatly extended the time by which the indictment must be served and therefore increased the notice that the defence will have of the full indictment, the witnesses and the time that it has to prepare its case.<br><br>
Clause 13 leaves discretion in the court. The special defence has to be lodged 10 clear days before the trial diet. Of course, there will not normally be a preliminary diet. That time is the same as at present, although the defence will have had much more notice of the indictment. The new provision extends the time for acceptance of the late special defence up to when the jury is sworn, at the discretion of the court.<br><br>
I must emphasise that the purpose of a special defence is to give notice to the Crown and to the co-accused that that is the explanation being given. It is not purely an explanation of innocence. It is an explanation saying "I didn't do it, I wasn't there, and, if I was, it wasn't me. If it was me, it was in self-defence", or whatever. It is an explanation. It is notice of that explanation that is necessary.<br><br>
It is almost inconceivable that, with legal aid and the increased notice which the Bill gives for the service of the indictment, an accused or his solicitor could genuinely say "I am terribly sorry. I learnt only this afternoon that there was an alibi or grounds for self-defence." There may be circumstances in which that is so. If it is fair to the Crown, which has to investigate the alibi, to the co-accused, who may say that it was not self-defence, that the story has been changed and that it puts him at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 901</span>
a disadvantage and to all the parties in all the circumstances, the court will be able to say either that it accepts it and allows to or that it refuses it.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept from me that, angry as a court is when such a plea is put in late, it is extremely reluctant not to accept it, because, if it is a valid plea, it is greatly to the prejudice of an accused not to do so. But the court must balance against that prejudice to other accused persons and the interests of justice. I hope that explanation is satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has covered all the points, except one, and that is the one that worries me. It is not unknown for someone to come forward and to confess—and perhaps confess convincingly. Sometimes people confess without very much conviction. I know of such a case which I raised with the hon. and learned Gentleman recently. Is it not possible that such a thing could happen—I suspect it has happened—on the day of the trial? Someone could come forward and say "It wasn't Jimmy. It was me."<br><br>
Are we saying that, if that were to happen, there is no means whereby justice could be done because this could not be adduced at the trial? Or is there a means of dealing with that situation? We are talking not about accusing someone else, but about a new witness coming forward who would immediately provide the basis for a special defence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we take only the Myles-Lee situation, it would be extremely unfair if Lee's solicitor, not having blamed Myles until the day of the trial, stated "I have found a witness who says that Lee did not do it, but that Myles did." That would be an incrimination of the co-accused at the last moment and would be grossly unfair to him. Therefore the discretion on fairness must be left to the court.</span></p>
<p>8.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that completely. Indeed, I am seeking to leave matters to the court. I am not talking about someone else's accusation but of the guilty person himself coming forward. A plea of special defence could not be proffered previously because it was not known who it was—"I could only deny that it was not me; I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 902</span>
could not say it was him", so to speak. But on the day of the trial the "him" in question comes forward. I have seen that happen, although it does not occur frequently. But are not we to say that if what happens is not that someone accuses somebody else but that a person accuses himself—he comes forward to confess—that provides the basis for a special defence, or does it take another form and perhaps such a defence is not applicable? I would like an assurance on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstance mentioned by the hon. Gentleman if someone came forward and said that he did it he would just go on the list of defence witnesses. He would be called and would say "I was the person who did it", and he would be either believed or disbelieved. The question of incrimination arises when someone says that somebody else did it. I have never been in an incrimination case in which the person involved did not say "Rubbish. I didn't do it." Therefore I do not believe that such a circumstance would arise.<br><br>
But there is another matter that the Committee should understand. In order to get off someone who is in the dock somebody else may claim that he has committed the offence. It is very easy to come forward at the last minute and say "As a matter of fact I did it." Of course he would not have any immunity if he said that, as in the case of Cairns being called as a defence witness, but he has it if he is called by the Crown, because he would be turning Queen's Evidence.<br><br>
Therefore it is important for fairness that notice should be adhered to in all circumstances unless exceptional circumstances can be shown when in the discretion of the court it would be fair to allow the matter to be arrived at later.<br><br>
Perhaps because of being here at this time of the morning, I forgot to mention that the accused in the case of which I spoke were not Myles and Lee. My client was called Myles Lee and the other man was James McFarlane. That is for the benefit of <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has covered the point. May I try to simplify matters? He seemed to say that in such an event—we know that it often happens that a confession is not genuine; however it might happen in a genuine way—the defence counsel would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 903</span>
have the person making the confession brought forward as a defence witness. The court would listen to the evidence and decide whether the defendant was guilty or innocent. If he were found innocent presumably a trial of the person who came forward would take place. That covers the point that was bugging me and I thank the Solicitor-General for his protracted explanation. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

PREVENTION OF DELAY IN TRIALS</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>'on application made to him for the purpose extend the period mentioned in subsection (1) above where he is satisfied that delay in the commencement of the trial is due to

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 184, in page 14, line 36, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'331B.

<ol>
<li>the illness of the accused or a sheriff;</li>

<li>any other sufficient cause which is not attributable to any fault on the part of the prosecutor.".'.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 14 is one to which the Opposition will give a warm welcome. It is an excellent clause that brings in some much-needed improvements for criminal procedure in Scotland.<br><br>
The first provision is that an indictment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 904</span>
trial when the accused is not being held in custody will have to start within 12 months of the first appearance of the accused on petition. That gets over a difficulty whereby one or two extremely complicated cases—admittedly they are often complicated by illness or personal difficulties of the accused—have been allowed to drag on for two years and more without the trial even starting. That is an undignified position and one that is bad for the administration of justice.<br><br>
The second change, a small but important and sensible one, is that although the well established 110-day rule will still apply, the 110 days would run to the start rather than the finish of the trial. The previous provision laid a difficult and largely unreasonable duty of estimation on the Crown Office. Although in one sense the change could be thought slightly to weaken the safeguards, the element of certainty compensates for that.<br><br>
The measure that I like most is the new section 331A of the 1975 Act, which deals with summary offences and makes clear that there is a summary equivalent of the 110-day rule. The trial of someone held in custody will have to start within 40 days of the bringing of the complaint in court. That is a most important safeguard.<br><br>
I know that sheriff clerks strive very hard to get an early trial diet for those who are remanded in custody to await trial. However, there can always be oversights, difficulties and slip-ups. It is quite right that a practical and reasonable time limit should be specified. We hope that this provision will seldom come into play and that trial dates will be found well within the 40 days. However, it is important to have such a long-stop provision.<br><br>
Rather than unhook swords on the clause stand part debate, I make my warm welcome plain to the Committee, and I now turn to my amendments, which I believe to be of some importance.<br><br>
The amendments deal with the provisions made for applications to the court for extensions of each of the limitations—the 110 days, the 40 days and the 12 months. In each of those cases there is a provision for a party—the prosecution, in effect—to ask the court for an extension.<br><br>
In some cases the extension is to be granted merely on cause shown, at the discretion of the court. That is one standard. It applies to the 12 months' rule in non-custody indictment cases and to the summary custody cases dealt with under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 905</span>
amendment No. 184. In those two instances there is the simple criterion that cause must be shown, and it is then a matter for the discretion of the court.<br><br>
However, under subsection (4) of the new section 101 other criteria can be applied in the case of the 110-day rule. The court must be satisfied
<br><blockquote><p>"that delay in the commencement of the trial is due to—
<ol>
<li>the illness of the accused or of a judge;</li>
<li>the absence or illness of any necessary witness; or</li>
<li>any other sufficient cause which is not attributable to any fault on the part of the prosecutor."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That last criterion is the important one. I tabled my amendments—I say unashamedly that I am indebted to the Law Society of Scotland for the suggestions in them—because when we introduced such a range of restrictions and such important safeguards the machinery for extending the time limits should be on an equal basis in each case.<br><br>
I should like, in particular, the criterion in subsection (4) (<i>c</i>) to be written into the two provisions that I mentioned first, which are at present restricted to cause shown and then the discretion of the court.<br><br>
Clearly, under the clause as presently constructed, it would be possible, on the discretion of the court, to grant a delay—an extension of the time limit—even if there had been fault on the part of the prosecutor. There may be arguments for moving the definition either way, but it seems inexplicable why there should be two different criteria. It is to overcome that difficulty that I have tabled the amendments. Paragraphs 15.2 of the Law Society's memorandum states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council again comments adversely no the fact that, in a non-custody indictment case, an application to extend the twelve months need be only 'on cause shown' and the prosecutor's fault is not excluded. This provision, which to that extent is opposed, is in contradistinction to the provisions for a custodial indictment case or a summary case, where the prosecutor's fault is excluded. The Council considers that all these three provisions should be identical, and that the Bill should be so amended."</p></blockquote>
I may have got somewhat confused by the intricacies of some of the amendments when I put them down, but I think that the intention and the point of principle are clear. I should be grateful for the comments of the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 906</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for the substantial welcome that he has given the provisions of the clause. The Committee will recognise that the prevention of delay inherent in this clause gives an accused person in Scotland substantially increased rights, indeed rights far greater than exist elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I hope that this clause and others like it in the Bill emphasise to the Opposition and to those who have sought to criticise the Bill as a whole that it should not be seen as seeking to reduce the powers of accused persons, or to increase them. They are separate provisions, each to be considered on its merits. If the Bill is seen as a package, it can be seen as a fair contribution to a proper balance between the rights of accused and the rights of the prosecuting authorities.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Garscadden will advise the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), when he is writing his next piece for the <i>New Statesman,</i> that he might like to devote at least one article to clauses such as clause 14, which I am sure will be of interest to the readers of that magazine from whatever part of the United Kingdom they come.<br><br>
Amendment No. 67 would impose upon the court, before it could extend the 12-month period, the necessity to meet certain very stiff requirements. The hon. Gentleman has pointed out that these requirements are presently necessary—and will continue to be necessary—in the case of the 110-day rule. However, there is a fundamental difference which is relevant to the two matters.<br><br>
In the case of the 110-day rule we are concerned with people being held in custody. Obviously, it is right, if any question of extending the 110-day rule is to be considered, that there should be only very limited circumstances in which a person held in custody for up to 110 days should be allowed to be held for a further period. It is right that the criteria laid down should have to be satisfied before the court could exercise a discretion in that way.<br><br>
The 12 months rule does not affect people in custody but concerns those who are on bail and at liberty. The objective of the 12-month period is important to sustain, but it should not require such a rigid and restrictive set of criteria before the court could permit an extension. There is still the requirement that the court must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 907</span>
be satisfied on cause shown that it is appropriate to permit a further extension.<br><br>
We have to see this also as very much an innovation. We are not yet certain what the implications will be, because in some areas there may be genuine difficulties in the case of very complex trials—perhaps a complex fraud or an indictment which runs to a considerable length of time. It would be wrong at this stage to try to impose the rigid restrictions which the amendment would necessarily provide.<br><br>
It is better that there should be a discretion to the court, albeit on cause shown. At least, the court will then be able to use its own judgment as to whether in the circumstances it would be reasonable or unreasonable to allow the matter to be extended—emphasising, as I do, that we are here dealing with an accused who is at liberty and therefore falls to be treated differently from a person who is in custody.<br><br>
Amendment No. 184 seeks—</span></p>
<p>8.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Under-Secretary. I am joining the league of the bewildered, with the Solicitor-General who is confused about the names of his clients. I totally misunderstood the meaning of amendment No. 184 and was looking for another amendment similar to amendment No. 67. Hence the long and stumbling delays.<br><br>
The point of amendment No. 184, as I well now realise, is important—to introduce a new safeguard that an accused—even an accused who is not in custody-should not be tried on summary complaint if six months has passed from the date of the offence. The reason, in shorthand, is that there is already a similar provision in regard to statutory offences. I have had representations from men learned and experienced in the law that it is peculiarly invidious that the six-months rule, as we call it, should time bar a statutory offence but not a common law offence.<br><br>
To give a simple and obvious example, someone might be charged with assaulting a policeman and there would be no six months' limit on his case coming to court. On the other hand, if he were charged in the same circumstances with a statutory offence under section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, the six months' rule would run.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 908</span>
It seems totally illogical that we should make that distinction between common law and statutory offences, when the circumstances may be exactly the same. If it is right that the prosecution must be raised within six months under statute, there is a strong case for putting the same provision on the common law offence.<br><br>
I hope that that rather garbled interpolation will explain to those who may read the report of these proceedings, and to the Under-Secretary, what amendment No. 184 strives to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, of course, correct that the purpose of this amendment would be to provide in summary cases a similar maximum period except that it would be six months rather than 12 months—to that provided in solemn cases.<br><br>
The Government see no objection in principle to the six-month period. The question at present is the severe practical problems that would arise if we sought at this stage to make that a statutory requirement. We see the six months as more of a target for which to aim, and we hope that one day it will be possible to take it as a similar requirement. But there is at present a substantial backlog of summary cases to be dealt with, and there would be severe problems of accommodation and otherwise if such a restriction were introduced now, particularly when we are introducing a stringent provision in the solemn category.<br><br>
It seems more important that, if we are to start in this direction—which we are happy to do—the first emphasis should be on solemn cases, because those are clearly the more serious matters, are of more concern to the accused, and must be resolved as quickly as possible. But we do not dissent from the principle of what the hon. Gentleman seeks. We see six months as a desirable target, but, for the reasons I have indicated, we do not feel it appropriate now, because of the heavy backlog, to impose an additional burden on the sheriff courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that matters which would provide an interesting potential debate have come up when we cannot do justice to them in discussion in the Committee.<br><br>
The point is self-evidently important, and I think that most of my hon. Friends will have already made up their minds
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 909</span>
about it. I am not entirely convinced on amendment No. 67, but I see what the Minister is driving at. I shall not trouble the Committee further with that amendment and shall ask leave to withdraw it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 184, over which I apologise again for stumbling, is of some importance. I had been looking forward to speaking to it in a more leisured manner. I am glad that the Under-Secretary accepts the principle. For one wild and giddy moment, I thought that we were about to have from him a concession of substance. But he has a heart of steel, however skilfully he cloaks it, and we are left pathetically at the gate with nothing in our bowl.<br><br>
All I can say is that, if it is acceptable in principle, it is time that we put it on the statute book. There is no doubt that, if the only argument against it is administrative, bureaucracies and Governments and solicitors and advocates—and the Lord knows who—will always find reasons why it is not practical to introduce it.<br><br>
There are many examples in the Bill. Judicial examination itself, for example, will put it that bit further beyond our grasp, if we accept the logic of such arguments. I really believe that there is much truth in the old cliche of political argument that the only way to make progress is to legislate bravely and force those who have to work the administration to accommodate one's good ends within the practicalities of their machinery.<br><br>
I believe that the Minister is absolutely right when he says that the six months is something at which we should be aiming. I, however, go further. I say that we should be taking practical steps to achieve it. It would be silly to compromise with nine months. There is no possible compromise. We have either to grasp the nettle or not</span></p>

<p>to grasp the nettle.</p>
<p>I know that my hon. Friends have been thinking about this amendment for some time. In a matter of such simple principle, where there is unanimity on the virtue and value of what is proposed, even after the very short debate we have had, I would advise my hon. Friends to divide the Committee on amendment No. 184, in the hope that, even now, at the eleventh hour, there may be some response in Tory breasts.</p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 67.</p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 184, in page 14, line 36, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'331B. An accused shall not be tried on a summary complaint unless such trial is commenced within a period of six months from the date of the offence or within six months of the date on which sufficient evidence to justify prosecution came to the knowledge of the procurator fiscal:</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>Provided that—
<ol>
<li>nothing in this subsection shall bar the trial of an accused for whose arrest a warrant has been granted for failure to appear at a diet in the case;</li>
<li>on application made for the purpose the sheriff may extend the period mentioned above where he is satisfied that delay in the commencement of the trial is due to—</li>
<ol>
<li>the illness of the accused or a sheriff;</li>
<li>the absence or illness of any necessary witness; or</li>
<li>any other sifficient cause which is not attributable to any fault on the part of the prosecutor.".'.—[<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at seven minutes to Nine o'clock till Thursday 5 June at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
