	<div class='title'>QUALIFICATION OF JURORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 11, leave out paragraph (	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 12, leave out "the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment gives us an opportunity to clear up one or two minor points on which the Under-Secretary can help us in very short order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the provisions in clause 1 mean that the liability and qualification of a person to serve as a juror depend on a number of conditions. I assume that it is a self-policing system—namely, that the authorities will make up their jury lists from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
parliamentary and local government rolls and that it will be the responsibility of those who are summoned for jury service to examine the text sent to them to ensure that they are within the categories set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes the removal of the condition that the juror
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for any period of at least five years since attaining the age of 13 years".</p></blockquote>
I assume that when I receive my summons I must ask myself whether I have lived for five years in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. If I have not, I must advise the authorities that I am not liable for jury service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been tabled to ascertain whether that is the position and that it is not for the authorities to establish those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say something about penalties. Again, we require clarification. The penalties are set out in clause 3. Those who are ineligible can be fined £200, and those who are disqualified can be fined £1,000. There is a third category of those who claim falsely to be excusable, and they can be fined £200. Those three qualifications refer to schedule 1 under the headings "Persons Ineligible", "Persons Disqualified" and "Persons Excusable as of Right".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone wickedly thinks that there might be some excitement in serving on a criminal jury and decides to serve when he has not lived for five years
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man … since attaining the age of 13 years",</p></blockquote>
what will be the penalty for so doing? That person would not fall into any of the three categories in the schedule to which the penalties are tied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word used in clause 1 is "qualified". Someone who is disqualified and serves is liable to a fine of £1,000. It is the heaviest penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone deceives the authorities by serving without the proper residence qualification—having been put on the list because he happens, after only two or three years' residence in the country, to be on the electoral roll—by which of the penalty clauses would he be caught? He would think it rather unfortunate if "qualified" in clause 1
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
meant that he came within the category in subsection (l)(	<i>c</i>) of clause 3 and liable to a £1,000 penalty. It will be helpful if the Minister explains the policing of the system and the way in which penalties are likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment would leave in subsection 1(	<i>c</i>) but remove the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man".</p></blockquote>
It would leave the five-year qualification merely for residents of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will appreciate that those on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man do not vote in this country. I believe—although I am open to correction—that they have their own court systems. It seems rather strange that residence in those far-flung island outposts should make someone liable for jury service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point of the five-year provision. I assume that it is some sort of guarantee that people will be familiar with the ways of this country and that there will be no problems concerning language or ability to understand what is happening during a jury trial. However, I still find the matter a little strange. Surely there is a simple straightforward way of saying that if someone is eligible to vote in a parliamentary election he may also perform jury service. It is clear that the Government take a different view and I hope that the Minister will tell us why that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to try to answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), both on the general issues and on the amendments that are before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first general issue raised by the hon. Gentleman concerned whether there is an obligation, either on those drawing up the jury list or on those receiving notification of the requirement to serve on a jury, to scrutinise their eligibility. Those who draw up the list will have the register of electors for local and parliamentary elections, but that will not tell them about length of residence, for example, or about someone's occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what happens when someone receives a requirement to serve on a jury. The hon. Gentleman will see
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
from clause 3 that that person would be guilty of an offence only if he served on a jury in the knowledge that he was ineligible. It is clear that the onus would be on the prosecution to prove that his service was performed while he knew that he was ineligible or disqualified at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify whether a notification to serve on a jury will be written in language that someone who may not be qualified to serve will understand? I find some of the language in the Bill extremely difficult to understand. I should not want someone who had received a notification not to comprehend what it said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the general observation of the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) that legislation, which must be carefully drafted to reduce the danger of ambiguity, is sometimes difficult for a layman to understand. It does not necessarily follow that the same will apply to notifications of the requirement to serve on a jury that are sent to members of the public. There is no need for them to be couched in complex language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone misunderstood the notification, he could not later be said to have served on a jury knowing that he was disqualified. He would not have deliberately intended to serve, knowing that the Act forbade him from so doing. He would not have to prove anything. The obligation to do that would be on the prosecution. The person in question would be guilty of an offence only if the prosecution could satisfy the court that he knew that he was ineligible or disqualified at the time in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I receive an inquiry concerning jury service—if I remember correctly, one first receives a form that must be returned—and I carelessly complete it in on the ground that I am a good Briton who has lived here for four years, having been in Rhodesia for 30 years before that, perhaps without realising that there is or not reading about, the five year qualification, I suspect that the onus of proof will shift. That is because there will be an assumption by the court that I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
read the instructions. The Minister may correct me, but I suspect that it will be up to me to prove that I was under a genuine misapprehension and did not understand the meaning of the words "five years". How do I do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Carelessness is not an offence, nor is it proposed that it should be under the Bill, but if the evidence before the court is a document which asks the accused how long he has lived in the country and he indicates that it is four or five years when he has lived here for only three years, it will certainly be for him to satisfy the court that that was due to a genuine misunderstanding on his part rather than to a deliberate intent to deceive. I do not believe that a new precedent is created in making that observation. That is the way in which it will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about different fines imposed under clause 3. He will see that the fine for those serving while disqualified is substantially greater than the fines proposed for those who serve while ineligible. The reason for that is that the consequences of a disqualified person serving on a jury could be far more serious. The hon. Gentleman and the Committee will see that those who are disqualified, as listed in the schedule, are those who have previously been convicted of crimes or offences. The dangers of unfairness if a person with a criminal conviction served on a jury could be far more serious. A person who has been convicted of a crime is that much more inappropriate to serve on a jury, and for that reason the proposed maximum fine is that much higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the fact that "disqualified", which appears at the beginning of clause 1, covers all potential jurors and that clause 3 merely refers to a person who has been disqualified from jury service being liable for a fine of up to £1,000. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the reference to "disqualified" relates to those who are referred to in Part II of schedule 1, which is headed "Persons Disqualified". Only persons coming into that category will be subject to the higher potential fine. Although a similar word may have been used earlier, when we are concerned with penalties we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
concerned with persons disqualified under schedule 1. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if I fell foul of clause 1 in the sense that I served under false pretences of, for example, my length of stay in this country, the maximum fine that could fall on me would be the lesser fine of £200?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my understanding. The only persons who would be entitled to be fined up to the maximum of £1,000 are those who come under the category of clause 3(1)(c). Such a person would be one who:
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowing that he is a person disqualified from jury service, serves on a jury".</p></blockquote>
Given that part II of schedule 1 has a category relating to those who are disqualified, clearly anyone who does not come within that category may not be qualified but has not been specifically disqualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the sanction attached to an offence under clause 1 is not clear. There does not seem to be any created sanction because the jury service offences listed in clause 3 are clearly and unequivocally tied to the categories in the schedule. There does not seem to be any specific sanction provided for someone who offends under clause 1, for example, by making a false declaration about his length of stay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman seeks to make the point that while a person who has been ordinarily resident for less than five years is not entitled to serve on a jury there is no specific reference to which penalty he would be liable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or any penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider that and seek to advise the hon. Gentleman. I believe that in general terms he may be satisfied that persons disqualified under part II of schedule 1 are those, and only those, who would be liable to the maximum fine. I shall have that confirmed and will advise the hon. Gentleman.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the two amendments which are before the Committee. The hon. Gentleman asked about the requirement in respect of the five years' residence qualification before a person can serve on a jury. He asked why—if someone appeared on the register of electors— that criterion should not be sufficient to enable him to serve on a jury. If a person's name appears on that register he is entitled to vote, but he is not obliged to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he feels that he is unable to understand the requirements of an election, or if his inability to use the language prevents him from comprehending its purposes or being able to involve himself in it, he may decide to opt out of the electoral process. Voting is not compulsory. There is no obligation. The presence of a name on the electoral register merely gives an entitlement to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, jury service is a public obligation, and we must ask ourselves whether it is appropriate to impose an obligation on persons whose residence in this country may be for only a short time. The primary problem concerns language. Therefore, the residence requirement has been introduced. It is a form that has been used satisfactorily for some years in England and Wales. It has not led to any concern about its implications. It is appropriate that jurors, who are expected to follow in detail the problems and technicalities of a trial, should understand not only the superficial events, but the nature of the issues that must be discussed and determined. It seems reasonable to assume that those who have lived here for less than five years would be unlikely to be able to meet that requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who live in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not automatically entitled to serve on a jury. Unless they are now resident in this country they do not appear on the register of electors and, therefore, cannot be considered in the first place. If they are so registered, the practical factors to which I have referred will not apply because the language problem will not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about French?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seriously sus-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
pect that that would be a major consideration for many Channel Islands' residents, and certainly not for those from the Isle of Man. Therefore those factors do not apply. That is the explanation for the requirement. The system has worked satisfactorily elsewhere in the United Kingdom and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel that it is necessary to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say
"Manx" as a further impediment to progress, but I shall resist that because I do not wish to press the amendments to a Division. I consider that the point about the sanction is of minor technical importance and I am glad that the Minister has agreed to consider that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>The following amendment stood upon the Paper: No. 3, in page 2, line 21, leave out "civil or criminal".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 3 is dependent on new clause 6, the purpose of which is to abolish civil jury trials. When the clause was originally drafted it was intended to abolish such trials in both the court of session and the sheriff court. New clause 6 has been changed so as to limit the attempted abolition to the sheriff court alone. In those circumstances, the amendment becomes defective. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first of a series of amendments dealing with various groups of people who are ineligible, disqualified or excusable as of right. I belive that there are amendments to cover each of those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 is concerned with solicitors and others. Schedule 1 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Advocates and solicitors, whether or not in actual practice as such"</p></blockquote>
as being among those who are ineligible. It goes on to include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"advocates' clerks and employees of solicitors in private practice".</p></blockquote>
My amendment merely seeks to remove the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and employees of solicitors in private practice",</p></blockquote>
because that category seems to be too broad. We should remember that those people would be ineligible for jury service—if the Bill stands as drafted—for 10 years. That is a long time to disqualify someone who may have had no job in a solicitor's office other than that of receptionist or the man who delivers mail to the St. Vincent's street offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the large number of people who are likely to be employed to do such a job, as a result of the Secretary of State for Industry's decision, it would be thoroughly reprehensible to underline that in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a tribute to the breadth of mind and tolerance of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). It might have been suggested that people who take part in such wicked activities as breaking the Post Office monopoly should be disqualified from jury service as a reward for their efforts. But it is a serious matter. As drafted, the Bill would disqualify typists and everyone else working in a solicitor's office. There is no conceivable justification for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point because amendment No. 5, to which the Minister will speak, goes a long way to meeting our objective. That amendment means that ineligibility will not apply to all employees of solicitors in private practice but merely to "advocates' clerks" and
	<br><blockquote><p>"apprentices of, and legal trainees employed by solicitors".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
That represents a sharp narrowing of the category, which we would welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two or three questions to ask the Minister which will, I believe, shorten our proceedings. As I understand the matter, apprentices are a dying breed. I was the last of the concurrent apprentices; I did my law training while attending university. All of those who have followed in my footsteps have been full-time apprentices who did their training after taking their degrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand—the Solicitor-General for Scotland will certainly have the information at his fingertips—that there will be a diploma of legal training which will cover a full-time year. That will be followed by a period of trainee solicitor-ship; a person will not attend classes, he will not have apprenticeship status and, more importantly, he will certainly not have an apprentice's salary. Instead, he will have a sort of restricted solicitor's status with a limited practising certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, in a few years' time the legal apprentice will remain in the memory only of old men such as myself. Therefore, I wonder whether it is right to include apprentices in the Bill, as within the next two or three years they will certainly have disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, I do not know who "legal trainees" are. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. The Solicitor-General says that he has much to learn about the law and I do not doubt that he is still in training. I hope that much public money is being spent on that monumental task. But my point is a serious one—who are "legal trainees"? Are they trainee solicitors who have taken their diploma in legal services, or are they not? This is a somewhat grey area which needs clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the rationale of the proposal is that solicitors and those who deal direct with clients who may be directly involved in a case should not undertake jury service. This is a difficult line to draw. I am unusual in that I served on a jury when I was a law student and as I served, a concurrent apprenticeship. I did jury service as a law apprentice in an office. It did me no harm. I found it a fascinating and interesting experience. I am not sure whether the line should be drawn so distinctly in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is difficulty over definition—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0932">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
for example, an unqualified assistant who is not caught by the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"legal trainee employed by solicitors"</p></blockquote>
because he has no qualification in mind. He could be merely an unqualified clerk, but he may be the person doing an enormous amount of the preparation for a trial, seeing a client frequently, holding counsel's hand at the High Court, or taking the precognitions. If the Committee considers that someone involved in that Government of work— that is normally the solicitor—should not do jury service, perhaps others should not do it either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether we are floundering about in a grey area and whether it would have been better to accept the amendment, which would have left it at "qualified solicitors". That would have been understandable, clear and easily defined. I await with interest the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Garscadden said that his service on a jury did not, in his view, do him any harm. May I respectfully say that that is not the proper criterion to apply when considering eligibility for jury service? It has never been suggested that the majority of advocates, solicitors, policemen and others would necessarily have harm done to them if they were to serve on a jury. It was certainly not the Government's intention that the hon. Gentleman should misunderstand the purpose of the legislation in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that the trial on which I sat resulted in a conviction. The Solicitor-General for Scotland, with his present enthusiasm, will certainly be delighted to know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not indicated whether the conviction was unanimous or by a majority, which might also be of interest to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said correctly that the clause is drafted widely and includes not merely advocates, clerks and solicitors, but employees of solicitors in private practice. That covers a wide range of persons, some of whom are intimately involved in the criminal courts while others of whom have no
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
practical connection. Clearly it includes the clerks, secretaries, receptionists and anyone employed in a solicitor's office. The Government consider that the general point of the hon. Gentleman's amendment was fair in that in our concern with those who are ineligible for jury service it is clear that only those for whom jury service is considered to be inappropriate by the nature of their occupation should be included in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that fact, the Government have no difficulty in recommending to the Committee that they accept 'the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The question is whether it is sufficient. The amendment by itself refers only to advocates and solicitors. It does not include those who for all practical purposes are doing the job of a solicitor while not being fully qualified. They may have the same training and involvement in the law, which would render undesirable their service on a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the jury system is to have a jury of laymen, not of lawyers. If we include in the exclusions those who are fully qualified as solicitors o advocates and exclude those who are on the point of being qualified, or in the process of training, for that purpose, we do not fulfil properly the purpose of the exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the wording of the Government amendment, which is not an alternative to the hon. Gentleman's rather an addition to it, is somewhat general in that it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"… apprentices of, and legal trainees employed by, solicitors".</p></blockquote>
This is a fair compromise that will ensure that the public interest is properly protected. It is true that apprentices as a breed are being phased out. However, there will continue to be apprentices until those existing already complete their indentures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about legal trainees. We consider "legal trainees" to be a suitable genetic wording which will be easily understood. As the hon. Gentleman has correctly said, from 1st January persons wishing to become solicitors are required to take a diploma in legal practice. Clearly that will become the standard form of training for those seeking entry to the profession. Someone who is taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
that diploma and is employed by a solicitor—the wording refers only to those employed by a solicitor—will clearly be in legal training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that one cannot find a form of words, other than the schedule as it stands, that will exclude the possibility that someone in a solicitor's office may have access to information or will occasionally have been in the courts. Although they are neither solicitors nor legal trainees they may have been involved in the legal process. It is right that there can be no guarantee. However, if one were to take that rigid view one would have to leave the schedule in its present form. That would be a cast iron way of ensuring that all such persons were excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we cannot have an absolutely perfect exclusion, such as would in theory be desirable, is it better to include legal trainees and apprentices, whom common sense places in the same position as solicitors for the purposes of jury service? The arguments in favour of excluding solicitors surely apply in exactly the same way to those who are about to become solicitors, who are working in solicitor's offices and are in the course of training and qualifying to become solicitors. That is the rationale behind the amendment. I invite the Committee to accept both the hon. Gentleman's amendment and the Government's amendment, which we feel brings the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will definitely be some minor problems. If one is saying that a certain group is ineligible, it is clearly important to define that group with reasonable certainty. Had I been considering the drafting of the amendment I might have been interested in mentioning not legal trainees but those who are training with a view to a positive qualification. The phrase "legal trainee" will include those working for the Law Society examinations, for example, which will continue. The spirit of the measure is that the group should consist of those in the process of qualifying as solicitors, as opposed to acquiring a little legal training in order to be useful round the office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be an addition to the Opposition amendment, I should prefer a form of words that tie it to a course of training leading to qualification. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
might make it a little better and clearer. Perhaps the Minister will think about that. I do not wish to press the point. I agree that there is a difficult problem of definition. Between us we have produced amendments that improve this small passage in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misheard the Minister, but he seemed to refer to the phrase legal trainee as "a useful genetic group". Perhaps he meant generic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant generic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like genetic. I was about to congratulate the Minister on his use of the word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the Committee will agree to the withdrawal of amendment No. 4. We cannot leave out the same words twice, which would be the result if both amendments were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding, Mr. Gourlay, was that it would be consistent to accept the Opposition amendment, which deleted the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and employees of solicitors in private practice",</p></blockquote>
and to accept the Government amendment, which does not delete anything. It merely adds certain words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendment deletes the same words as are deleted by the Opposition amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 15, leave out line 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides another opportunity to ask the Government for an explanation. The ineligibility of special constables was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) on Second Reading. I should like to hear the Minister's view on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
whether special constables should always be ineligible. I accept that special constables have duties and responsibilities in that role and as members of the police force. I presume that the Minister will say that he wishes to maintain a total divide between the administration of justice and the police. I have some sympathy with that. I do not want to sound too pusillanimous about the amendment. It is not one that we would wish to force to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that special constables are members of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So are the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they are not engaged full-time in the police force. Presumably they may be trusted to ensure that they do not serve as jurymen in any case in which they are involved, or in which they know the officers well who are involved. Anyone can know the police officers involved in a case, and that would be a good reason for withdrawing from jury service. Presumably the clerk of the court would accept that as a good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should tell us why he considers that they should be treated as full-time professionals—as part of the police service and therefore on the other side of the divide in terms of jury service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment refers to special constables. I understand that the Opposition may not wish the amendment to be made. It may not even have the complete support of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) although I see that his name appears on the amendment. There may be various explanations for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bad writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted that the hon. Gentleman was not keen to move the amendment although he was given the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning is that special constables are, in a sense, in the same position as police officers. We have to ask why police officers are exempted from or made ineligible for jury service although the vast majority will have no personal knowledge of any case on which they might be asked to serve as jurors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The jury is meant to start as a group of laymen with no preference for the views
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of either the prosecution or the defence. We accept that a police officer serving on a jury would inevitably begin by assuming that the evidence of the prosecution— especially that of other police officers— was to be preferred to the evidence of the defence. It is human nature that he should do so, and inevitably the vast majority of police officers would do so. That is no discredit to them. The same would apply to any other occupational group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same considerations must apply to special constables. Although they are only part-time police officers they are in uniform when on duty. They associate with the regular police force. They adopt many of the attitudes, ideas and approaches of the regular police. The question is whether a special constable, when serving on a jury, will inevitably feel more sympathy for the evidence of the police, with whom he is in regular professional cooperation, than with the evidence of the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with that in mind that we considered it appropriate that special constables should be considered in exactly the same position as other police officers when questions of jury service arise. While it may be considered an unnecessarily wide restriction, we think that it is better to err on the side of fairness and emphasise that the jury in a criminal trial is meant to be a jury of fair men without any predilection for either side. It would, therefore, seem appropriate to include special constables in that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7 in page 16, leave out line 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to members of children's panels. The whole gravamen of the Minister's argument in either explaining or supporting the exclusions has been related to the word "layman". By definition the people appointed to children's panels are laymen. That is why they are appointed in this way. They are not judges. They are not even special constables. They are people concerned with social problems rather than with legal or judicial problems in the normal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
sense. They also understand and contribute a good deal to society. Surely, they would bring the right kind of layman's understanding to jury discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason for leaving these people on the definitions that the Minister has been giving. The overriding reason for putting them in is, surely, that we should cut down our list of exclusions to a minimum. We do not wish to be hell-bent on removing as many people as possible from jury service. We want to make juries a broad spectrum of society, of laymen and women who can play their part. There does not seem to be, even on the Minister's own judgments, any reason whatever for members of children's panels being left out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the argument, that they seem to be in a quasi-judicial position. That, I think, is a wrong reading of the role. It is, almost by definition, understanding that they are seen in a quasi-judicial position and then discarding that quasi-judicial position because they have to make judgments and consider problems in a social context rather than as judicial actions with judicial, legal and often punitive consequences. This is perhaps the first amendment on which it is essential that we take a Committee view, but I should first like to hear from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He has put the issue, as it exists, very fairly. He is certainly right that the onus should be upon those in certain categories to prove why thay should be excluded and not upon himself or others to prove why they should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is equally right in saying that we want to ensure that those who serve on juries can make a useful contribution to the issues that the jury has to determine, and there is no doubt that those who serve on children's panels have useful experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, two reasons led us to exclude that category. As the hon. Gentleman said, we take the view that the members of a children's panel are acting in a quasi-judicial fashion. After all, these are youngsters who would otherwise go before a court. The purpose of the panel is to determine the available treatment. Members of the panel are certainly seen by those who appear before them, as being the equivalent of a court but
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
acting as a quasi-judicial body. It is right that that should be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a separate issue. The members of the children's panel, like other ineligible categories, have unique access to information about the background and previous conduct of individuals who appear before them. They have, after all, the full background biographical details. They know that a large number of youngsters have been in trouble before and they know all the circumstances of the cases that appear before them, in the same way as a sheriff or a judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the Opposition agree that reporters—those who report to the children's panels—should be excluded, there is no amendment to delete them from the list. The reasons that apply are much the same in both cases. Both are members of the public, both are laymen, but both have an intimate involvement in the preparation of those cases where a child has broken the law but, because he is a child, he appears before the panel rather than before a formal court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other categories of ineligible people—directors of social work, for example, and probation officers. A probation officer is a good example of someone who is not a judge or a lawyer—he is a layman, a member of the public—but who, because of his intimate access to information and because he will be aware of the detailed background and the personal behaviour of those who may ultimately appear in the court and whose guilt or innocence will have to be determined by a jury, is thought inappropriate to serve on a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the matter in the following context. If a member of a children's panel serves on a jury, he will be likely to serve on a jury in the area in which he lives. He will therefore be likely to be called upon to decide the guilt or innocence of persons who live in that area, some of whom may have appeared before the children's panel at a previous time— such, unfortunately, being the pattern of repeated offences by youngsters over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, roughly, is our reasoning. Clearly it is inappropriate—so far as it is possible to exclude them—that those who serve on a jury should, because of their judicial or quasi-judicial activities, have had access to private and confidential information
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
about potential offenders. That is one of the factors we must take into account; clearly it is relevant to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will see that a number of other categories are included in the list. Many of the people concerned are not judges or qualified lawyers. For example, there are the
	<br><blockquote><p>"members of local review committees established by virtue of section 59(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967".</p></blockquote>
Those people are members of the public concerned with the review of prisons or penal establishments. Because of the nature of their occupation it is considered appropriate that they should be ineligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that because of the nature of the information they possess, members of the children's panels are not suitable for this role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have mixed feelings about this proposition. I myself was involved in the children's panel system for four and a half years. I recognise the persuasiveness of some of what the Minister has said, but I also found some of his remarks surprising. He made it clear that he thought that members of children's panels acted in a quasi-judicial capacity. We could have a lengthy debate—but we will not do so, Mr. Gourlay—on that point. I have some doubts about it. If there is any doubt about guilt or innocence, the matter is remitted to the sheriff for a decision. The children's panels are entirely concerned with questions of disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I had a legal qualification as a reporter, when I was asked about the reporter's role I would always say that it was more social work than legal work. I do not regard the members of the panel as substitute judges. The judicial process is largely completed, there has been an admission of guilt, and the task is to mobilise the best possible support for the child in trouble. That is not necessarily a judicial process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was extremely interested in one of the Under-Secretary's remarks. I think that it must have been a slip of the tongue. I understood him to say—I think I am paraphrasing him accurately—that he was anxious to make sure that those who served on juries made a useful contribution to their deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that one is anxious to ensure that, so far as possible, those
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
who might be able to make a useful contribution to a jury are not excluded for unnecessary reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a nice qualification. I am still a little worried about the spirit of that utterance, because I, like almost everyone in the legal profession, believe that the point of a jury is to be a random selection of people from the electroral roll, though that is qualified by certain other matters such as length of residence in this country, as we described earlier. If we talk of people who can make a useful contribution, we are walking a difficult and dangerous road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference, is there not, between trying by deliberate choice to secure people who would make a useful contribution and finding it rather nice if, through random selection, we got people who could make a useful contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is a third possibility, which is the Under-Secretary's position, as I understand it. That is that we should make a particular effort to ensure that those who can make a useful contribution are available. Of course, there would still be the random selection process thereafter, but at least he distinguishes between skilled jurymen who can make a useful contribution and, presumably, the 	<i>lumpenproletariat</i> who are less likely to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman must, as a defence solicitor, have objected many times to jurors when their names were called, on the basis that they might make too useful a contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General makes exactly the point. Then, of course, I am acting as the defender of a vested interest. I have a duty to my client. He is right that I use the peremptory challenge to get someone on the jury who I think will make a useful contribution. That is not someone who I think may be prejudiced against my client because, for example, he falls into the category of employment involved in the offence which will be the subject of the trial. There, I unashamedly use my power—which is more limited as a result of the Criminal Justice Bill, I regret to say —to defend the position of my client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely make the point that, if one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
considers ensuring that people able to make a useful contribution are available for jury service, one is almost suggesting that some people are "better" jurymen than others because they are more intelligent, professional, white-collar, or men of skill. I reject that, and I hope that the Under-Secretary, despite his qualifications, will on maturer reflection agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the children's panel members are not part of the judiciary, and that there is an argument for saying that they ought to be available for jury service. That is not because they are "better" than anyone else—we hope that there will be a reasonable cross-section of the population in the children's panel system—but because they are members of society and qualified in every other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not impressed by the argument about confidentiality. There is always a problem about confidentiality for a children's panel member in his work. As the Minister rightly said, he often comes from the same locality as the children, and that was an original intention. A children's panel member often has to say to his chairman "I am sorry. I cannot serve on this hearing, because not only do I come from the same area, but I know the child and his parents. They come from two houses down and we have had altercations about his anti-social behaviour in the past." Such clashes of interest have been hsndled satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my four and a half years, I have never known a child or his parents object to someone serving on the panel on the grounds that they knew him or had been in conflict with him in other circumstances. I hardly see that there would be problems in serving on a jury, because if such a problem of confidentiality arose, the juror concerned would state his point to the sheriff or the sheriff clerk, and would be excused. It would be rare, but if it happened, it could be handled in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though it would not be the case in Glasgow, in the court in Airdrie, where I served as a solicitor for a long time, a juryman was frequently a neighbour of the accused. That is one reason why I regret the reduction in the number of peremptory challenges. If the offence took place in street A, where one's client lived, and people in the jury list came from the same street, the peremptory challenge seem very useful. They might have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
prejudiced in his favour or against him, but I as a defence solicitor was not prepared to take that risk, and I used my challenges to try to get rid of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It happens anyway. I do not see that it is complicated by the inclusion of children's panel members in the general pool from which jurymen are drawn. From their own point of view it might be interesting for them to taste—if I may put it that way—or experience jury service. I agree that this is not a primary consideration, but it might be useful for them to be involved in the administration of justice in the courts as they have been so heavily involved in the administration of children's panels, which is a very different world in atmosphere and approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only substantial reason that has not yet been mentioned why these people should not be put in is the very human one that they already give a lot of time to voluntary service as children's panel members. It is unpaid and very demanding service, and it takes up a great deal of time over a minimum of three years. I suppose that there is an argument that in equity they have done their bit and they should not also be at risk to be picked for jury service. But I am not sure that that is entirely convincing. I shall wait to hear whether the Minister has anything further to say, but it is something that he should perhaps consider again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) gave as one of his reasons the fact that it might be useful experience for members of the panel to see how the jury system operates. Whether that is a relevant consideration or not, it does not apply. Members of a children's panel will not have served as such since they reached the age when they appeared in the electoral register; they will have been eligible for jury service up to the time at which they became members of the panel. Therefore, it is probable that they will already have had experience of serving on a jury—at least as much as any other member of the public. Therefore, that is not a factor which need detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that members of a children's panel, although they might have intimate or prior knowledge of a particular accused because of their own service, on the panel, could always draw that knowledge to the attention of the court and that that should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
be a sufficient safeguard. I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman on this point and I think that on reflection he will not press it. The same argument could be said to apply to probation officers, reporters, or even police officers. None of them are solicitors or advocates but they are members of the public. However, because of the nature of their occupation, they are considered inappropriate for jury service because they have access to the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well saying that in some cases a member of a children's panel will, as soon as the jury has been empanelled, realise that he knows the identity of the accused. But in many cases that will only become apparent to him during the course of the trial, after which it will be too late for him to be exempt. Even if he does not know the accused, he may certainly know some of the witnesses—for the prosecution or the defence—who may be youngsters who have appeared before the panel because of their personal background. It is then highly inappropriate that members of the jury should, if it can be avoided, be aware of that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we exclude police officers, probation officers—another very good example—or, indeed, advocates and solicitors. It is not that they will necessarily know the accused but that they will have access to information which members of the general public do not have. A member of the public, by pure chance, may know the background identity of a witness or an accused person, but that is relatively rare. However, if a member of a children's panel serves on the jury in the area in which he has served as a member of that panel, he will, over the years, have seen large numbers of youngsters who, by definition, have been involved in offences which have brought them before the panel in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not just a possibility but an extreme likelihood that a member of a panel will have access to information about the criminal background of the accused or of witnesses who might be appearing in the trial, given that he would serve on the jury in the area in which he had served as a member of the panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is normally fatal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That is normally a fundamental factor to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
The hon. Gentleman disagreed with my suggestion that the panels were acting in a quasi-judicial way. I respectfully suggest that he reconsiders. Judges are not involved only in questions of guilt; they are also involved in questions of sentence, and the particular function of the panel is really one of sentence. It is not involved in the question of the guilt or innocence of the youngster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that "sentence" is an inappropriate word, and I am not suggesting that they formally sentence youngsters. But when the panel's members dispose of the youngster before them, they are carrying out the function which, if the panel did not exist, would be a sentencing function, although we do not call it that and we are right not to do so. The whole purpose behind the panel is different, in order not to criminalise the youngster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am making is that the function which the panel carries out is a function which, if the panel did not exist, would be a sentencing function carried out by a judge. In that sense it is, I think, simplistic to suggest that this is not a quasi-judicial function. Certainly it seems like that to those who appear before it, and is seen as that by the panel and the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we are all anxious to ensure that the panel is not a court, we are concerned with the function of the members of the children's panel, which is how to dispose of youngsters who have committed offences. To that extent, they are performing in the same way as a judge would perform once a youngster, or anybody, had been convicted of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same factors have to be taken into account when deciding on the right criteria for determining eligibility for a jury. The panel has access to sensitive information about the criminal background of the potential accused and potential witnesses, which can be used fairly or unfairly through service on a jury. That, plus the other factors to which I have drawn attention, seems to make this an overwhelming case for non-eligibility for jury service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember that members of the panel are not members all their lives. They serve for a relatively restricted period and there are not all that many members of panels throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. Therefore, it seems right to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
include this category in the list under this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to withdraw the amendment, until the Minister's last remark, which has put me in difficulties. If the quasi-judicial argument is his reason, I do not think his case stands. His first argument about background knowledge was more convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises a problem which could arise in any small locality. I do not think that it is possible to get a jury in any small locality that we can be sure does not comprise some members who know something about the person. They may know even more than the members of the panel and have a long-standing view of the offender. Therefore, knowledge is the crucial factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the quasi-judicial argument, the point is precisely the opposite. In fact, we say that this is a substitute for judicial action. It is not enough to say that the panel is a substitute for a sentencing role. We are putting the panel in a position which discards the judicial aspect, so, far from being quasi-judicial, it is the negative, the opposite position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have used the wrong words in conveying my meaning. What I mean is that the children's panel members have access to the same information as a judge would have, and that therefore the factors that would lead to the exclusion of a judge should lead to the exclusion of panel members. I entirely agree that its function is not a judicial one, and it was not my intention to suggest otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I am not at all sure that the Minister is right to say that this is the reason why we discard a judge. I hope that knowledge of background is not the only reason why we discard a judge. I think that there are other reasons as well and they are not quasi but judicial reasons, so the Minister's buttressing of his case by calling that in aid is no help to me at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am willing to accept the argument on this kind of knowledge. It is not a thing that can be avoided in any small area—it will be parallelled in other areas—but we can be sure that it is more likely to be specific knowledge in the case of members of the children's panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned with another factor. The members may be busy people,
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
already doing a great deal of voluntary work, and while we can hardly excuse people jury service merely because they may be inconvenienced, there may be a case for putting those two possibilities together to see whether the question is in balance. We then might look sympathetically at the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still swithering on this matter, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 16, leave out lines 14 and 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an amendment on which the Government have assisted us, and I am grateful for that. As drafted the Bill gives total exemption to those in category (	<i>s</i>). They would fall into the category of ineligible persons. That applies not only to
	<br><blockquote><p>"directors of social work appointed under section 3 of the said Act of 1968"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968—but also to "their staffs". Therefore, the amendment proposes that lines 14 and 15 be deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the arguments used in our last debate—I have no wish to force the Committee to listen to a repetition of those arguments—I am prepared to accept that to take out directors of social work altogether might be going too far. If we have found persuasive the argument that knowledge, in the specialised sense in which we are using it, is an impediment to children's panel members, the same argument could apply to directors of social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I confine myself to one or two questions about Government amendment No. 9 and what it means. The amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out 'their staffs' and insert 'persons employed to assist such directors in the performance of such of their functions as relate to probation schemes within the meaning of section 27 of that Act'."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to be difficult and ask silly questions for the sake of doing so, but there is a genuine problem with the word "assist" because almost everyone in a director's department will assist him. The girl who types the report for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
children's panel at the stage of someone's career before he arrives in court, or who types a probation report, is assisting the director in the performance of his functions. I am anxious to know how one limits those people or whether we shall end up in exactly the same position as before the amendment was tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also curious as to how we define those who help with the schemes
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the meaning of section 27 of that Act".</p></blockquote>
We now live in the age of the generic social worker. Although there is no doubt that, very sensibly, specialisation has begun to emerge in generic social work departments—I make no complaint about that; people now have weighted caseloads for their particular interests, specialisation and skill—it is still fair to say that any social worker can, on occasion, be called upon to help with court reports and to supervise a young person who is the subject of a probation order. The Solicitor-General may want to think about that, but I suspect we may be saying, at the end of the day, that all social workers, or everyone who, if not a qualified social worker, is involved in case work, may be caught by the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assist such directors in the performance of such of their functions as relate to probation schemes within the meaning of section 27 of that Act.".</p></blockquote>
There may be some way of limiting it. A youngster who comes from an inadequate home could be on probation and a home maker from the social work department could, in the course of helping with the family budget, give advice and support to the youngster. Is that home maker likely to be included in the "assist" concept in the Government amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the amendment is meant to be helpful but I am concerned whether it will be as effective as the Minister intends, or whether we will find that those who are typing probation reports or helping in the social work department will be caught and that the entire staff of the social work department will, by a process of contact, become ineligible. We should then be back to the position before the amendment was tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the slight scepticisim of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and his worry about whether Government amendment No. 9 achieves
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
its intended purpose. Naturally, we felt sympathy with amendment No. 8. Category (	<i>s</i>) of schedule 1 covers such people as home helps and those who look after the mentally ill and the disabled, and so on. Clearly, there is no reason for them to be exempted. Amendment No. 9 is an attempt to exclude such people who are—are likely to be or are capable of being—in possession of a special knowledge of a criminal background, which we discussed on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of England, the Morris committee recommended that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"probation officers and others engaged in after-care work, and social workers attached to prisons and other penal institutions should be excluded".</p></blockquote>
This is an attempt to exclude in Scotland such people as would be likely to have special knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked about typists. A typist would have access to sensitive information if she typed a probation report about someone and then was on the jury at his trial. She would be in possession of what would be in ordinary circumstances a fatal disqualification for conviction if it is brought to a jury's attention—namely, a knowledge of previous convictions. There are limited circumstances in which that might happen, but it is regarded as such a counterweight to the presumption of innocence—that is, the fear of guilt by previous history—that it excludes people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore of course the typist who had typed the probation report would be in possession of information that could make her not only biased herslef but capable of giving information to the other members of the jury which ordinarily would prevent them from returning a verdict of guilty or prevent it from being sustained. For those reasons I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acept that our amendment is intended to exclude all such persons, although it may be less than adequate in its perfection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always touched when the Solicitor-General admits to inadequacy —even if only inadequacy in perfection. I cannot stand up against such a persuasive argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties about the amendment's workability. After all, we are discussing ineligibility. There may be a genuine difficulty for someone in a social work department who receives a form inviting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
him to serve on a jury. I had one the other day; presumably that was on a random basis. I looked at the disqualified groups and saw the word "solicitor". That was fine; I knew where I stood and I was able to tear up the form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once this major law reform reaches the statute book those in the Committee who are still Members of Parliament will see that they are disqualified because of that. But I am thinking of some unfortunate person in a social work department who is not constantly concerned with case work that involves juvenile delinquents or other offenders, and who reads on the form "You are ineligible if you are employed assist the director of social work in the performance of such of his functions as relate to probation schemes within the meaning of section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act." I can hear him saying "My God, am I eligible or not?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter may resolve itself because the vast majority will not want to be bothered with jury service and will tear it up and put it in the bucket and probably nothing more will be heard of it. But some may be intrigued at the prospect, who want to serve, who will be genuinely puzzled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not oppose the amendment and I shall not push my own amendment. I recognise the good intentions of the Solicitor-General and we cannot always do that. In these circumstances I believe it would be churlish to make further opposition, but I advise him that my scepticism rages unabated. I believe that we have put on the statute book something which is hard to define, which may lead, not to major difficulties—it is not a major matter —but mainly to difficulties in the small sphere we are investigating.

It is difficult to see why a civil responsibility, if one likes, is being removed from such a large category of people. I should like to hear from the Solicitor-General why he feels that 10 years is appropriate. Ten years is a long time. There is a long list of people who will not be serving on juries for a long time and I am unable to see why it should be that long. I should have thought that a period of five years would overtake any of the circumstances we have heard this morning—that a member of a children's panel who had an involvement with some individual 10 years, nine years or eight years ago is to be excluded. Even in the unlikely circumstances that he would find himself confronted as a juror with someone in the dock after 10 years, it seems unlikely that he would recall anything about the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it should be possible for such a list of people to be able to opt out or be opted out of what is, after all, an important civil responsibility for 10 years. That is the main burden of my argument and I think that five years is a much more reasonable and appropriate provision, but I should like to hear what the Solicitor-General or the Under-Secretary has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, let the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East ponder this matter. If, as some of us think is likely and others unlikely, his hon.

There is no reason why a person in Holy Orders should be put into a kind of pariah category and debarred from contributing to the social weal by participating in jury service. What is the Government's anxiety? Is it that they may take too Christian or too charitable a view? Surely not. After all, the Solicitor-General for Scotland's main objective and ambition in life is to take Holy Orders. Not being content with being debarred as the Solicitor-General for Scotland, he wants to be debarred by becoming a monk. If anyone requires the title of "Trappist monk" it is the hon.

I can see the case for a person saying, "I am sorry but my conscience, sanctified by my vows, prohibits me from acting in judgment on my fellow man in this way." He would have the right to say that because he was in Holy Orders or an avowed member of a religious order, and he would automatically be excepted. But there is no case for declaring the others ineligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know the Government's views. I can see no reason for this. These are people who contribute to society, are part of it and should be treated in every other way as members of it. But if they feel that because of their vows they should be debarred from making such judgments, they have the right to be excused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. That is not asking holus-bolus acceptance or rejection; it is saying "Shift the category."

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General must be careful. He is getting very near the Act of Settlement of 1702. There is a great expert on that matter on the Committee. The hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that it is only because of establishment and the strange quasi-established position of the Church of Scotland that such sad disqualifications
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
exist. Perhaps amending legislation is a suitable matter to which the Solicitor-General should turn his legal mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend making the point that the episcopal living at Fordell would not come within this category, or is he saying that it is only ministers of the Established Church who cannot serve in the House of Commons?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I would look at the Act of Union of 1707 if I wished to see the position with regard to how the Act of Settlement affects such persons in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is no rationale why a minister of religion—who we might expect, I should have thought, to be even more faithful to the oath that the jury takes and more scrupulous in his approach to the
matter than other persons—should be exempted. Therefore, I see no reasons why they should be exempted. The Government accept the amendments put forward and cogently argued by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, on condition that the hon. Gentleman accepts my assurance that I shall never become a monk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>f</i>) refers to opticians. I cannot see why opticians should be included in the list. All the services listed have an emergency nature—medical practitioners, dentists, nurses, midwives, veterinary surgeons and veterinary practitioners and chemists. It is possible to envisage circumstances where their services could be required and pressures on them would prevent them from attending the court, or would lead to difficulties if they were called to jury service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am open to persuasion from the Government, but I cannot imagine an I emergency that would require an optician. That service can be provided by the emergency services of a hospital, which are always available. Therefore, I do not s understand why a practising optician
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
should be included in the list. The profession operates on a nine to five basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I look around the Committee Benches, only one of my hon. Friends is not in the unfortunate position of being handicapped and having to wear spectacles. That is my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey). I notice that the Under-Secretary wears spectacles and the Solicitor-General for Scotland very nearly wears spectacles. Those of us who use opticians know that they provide a nine to five service that is not tied to emergencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why opticians are being excluded and the Government must tell us why the exclusion is being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disagree entirely with the comment of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) that opticians work from nine to five. Many of us, as he rightly said, have a vested interest in spectacles inasmuch as we have to wear them because of age or for other reasons. We should not consider removing opticians from the list because the hon. Gentleman thinks that they work from nine to five. With great respect to him, it is clear that he has not studied what opticians do, otherwise he would not try to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to oppose the amendment that seeks to remove opticians from category (	<i>f</i>) of group D—persons who are excused as of right. It is wrong to suggest that opticians are not in a category that can be classified within medical professions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for Dumbartonshire, East, I did not say what he suggested. I argued that the service that opticians provide is not an emergency service and, indeed, is covered by the medical profession anyway. I accepted that it is a paramedical job. It is not an emergency service. Therefore the pressure is not on opticians and they could be withdrawn from the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his comments. However, I should like to correct him. I do not represent Dunbartonshire, East. If I did, he would not be here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor would my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I most certainly would, but not under the ticket that he is under.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I refute what the hon. Gentleman says about opticians. It is clear that he has not done his homework. There is a place in Glasgow called the Glasgow eye hospital, and there is a similar one in Greenock, where opticians provide a service. Opticians do not work a nine to five day. They serve as a form of practitioner. That is why I consider it right that the Government should categorise opticians as medical practitioners. In effect, they are medical practitioners. Some opticians who are not engaged in medical practice operate a small one-man business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that many right hon. and hon. Members have experienced the necessity to ask for, an appointment to have their eyes tested. One cannot walk into an opticians' practice and have one's eyes tested there and then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would create considerable difficulties for an optician if he had to serve on a jury. One of the greatest problems that confronts opticians who have one-man businesses is that they are unable to obtain locums. If they obtain locums, they find that they are tremendously expensive. That affects the profitability of small businesses and is a considerable disadvantage to the practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the advantage of that to small businesses or traders? Why should not slaters, for example, be excused? Slaters may have problems with leaking roofs and goodness knows what else. If opticians are excused on that basis, I do not see why slaters should not similarly be excused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that a slater looks after one's eyes, with respect, Mr. Gourlay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He looks after your roof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He looks after one's roof, but a roof is repaired by not only slaters but by several members of the building industry. As a member of that industry I have wide experience. There was no greater contractor in the Glasgow storm in 1968 than me. At that time I repaired all the roofs without any need for spectacles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong that amendments should be tabled to remove this classification from Schedule 3. It would be of considerable inconvenience if one made an appointment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
for a sight test and found that the optician had to withdraw for X days or X weeks dependent on the length of the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fulfilment of the religious training which has been wished on me by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), and encouraged by the hon. Member for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Chair will be indulgent. This has been a matter of widespread speculation among the Solicitor-General's friends and admirers on the Labour Benches. As we do not always believe implicitly everything that we read in 	<i>The Scotsman</i>—even when it is in direct quotation marks—" will the Solicitor-General say in one line whether Anglican priesthood is his ultimate ambition."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir. It is not the Anglican but the Episcopalian priesthood that is my ultimate ambition. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the Episcopal church never underwent Catholicism in the East of Scotland and so did not require to be reformed, unlike the Anglican church. There is a distinct difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fulfilment of my preparation I must paraphrase the Bible to the hon. Member for Dumbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). The eyes of the blind have been opened and the tongues of the dumb have been unstopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been overwhelmed by the hon. Gentleman's arguments. I must tell him that the reason that I nearly wear spectacles is that my optician was called away half way through the job to serve on a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my hon. slater for Aberdeenshire—and Glasgow, I gather. He would find that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. That is because I cannot see with or without my glasses. The argument that the hon. Gentleman used would apply to anyone. The man who empties septic tanks, unblocks the drains or stops the overflowing water tank is just as
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
important as an optician. If an optician were an opthalmologist and a medical practitioner, he would be excluded under category (f) of Group D. That is because medical practitioners—it does not say that they must be general practitioners— are excluded. Whether they are toenail specialists or eye specialists makes no difference to the category of exclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Solicitor-General for Scotland says, but surely he knows that there are many opticians serving in hospitals who are FBOAs—Fellows of the British Optical Association—or have similar qualifications. They are not medical practitioners but they carry out the function of attending to eyes. Whether one is a slater a plumber or otherwise has nothing to do with the physical aspect of being able to see with one's eyes. One can cure a roof, one cannot but cure the eyes without adopting the technical methods inherited through this life. That is done by the use of spectacles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said that to obtain one's spectacles is neither something which one can do in 24 hours, nor something which one needs to do in 24 hours. If the hon. Member falls downstairs outside the Committee Room and breaks his glasses, I shall be suprised if he manages to get a new pair with appropriate lenses in under a week. The chances of a jury trial lasting more than a week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He carries two pairs all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he carries two pairs all the time, he has established the unnecessity of opticians being excluded from jury service. There is, of course, a right on any person on cause shown to be excluded from a jury if, for instance, he is the only plumber in Kinlochrannock in winter and is asked to serve on a jury in Perth. With the chances of being cut off by snow while in Perth and not being able to return, or whatever rational excuse any eligible member of the public gives, he may be excused from jury service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to tell my hon. Friend that I have been unconvinced by his argument and, such is the blinding light
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
which has come to my eyes from Dunbartonshire, the Government advised the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise again with mixed emotions because all the splendid speeches that I was proposing to make in rebuttal of the crass reactionary views of the Solicitor-General for Scotland have now had to be put in my back pocket. I merely congratulate him on three out of three. I hope that the new spirit of consensus politics will continue. The blinding light which seems to have struck the hon. and learned Gentleman on the way to the Committee will, I hope, still be shining when we deal with the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill on report next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>"GROUP DD</p>
	<p>	<i>Ministers of religion etc.</i>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise a couple of matters to test the general knowledge of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I am intrigued by the remarkable omission in the schedule of those who for many years have been properly protected by the Juries (Lighthouse Keepers Exemption) Act 1869. The Committee will have noted with great sorrow that in schedule 3 the whole of The Juries (Lighthouse Keepers Exemption) Act 1869 has been excluded. It seems that there is a splendid case for including lighthouse keepers. I understand the reason for the repeal. However, I expected that lighthouse keepers would</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have lost my glasses by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman again for supporting the amendment. He will have our full support in holding off the fierce and no doubt spirited attacks of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). We shall support him in the Lobby if a vote takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 1.</p>
	<p>appear among those either ineligible or excusable as of right from jury service.</p>
	<p>I have no connection and no interest to declare in the case of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouse or anything of that sort, but like all the members of the Committee I have a deep feeling for those brave men who upon their lonely outposts of rock in the North Atlantic, at the peril of the sea, keep our seamen safe by shining a light upon dangerous waters. It seems extraordinary to me that at any moment, these men may be called away from the Skerryvore lighthouse or from Rockall—I do not think that there is a lighthouse on Rockall but perhaps there should be one—by jury service. They are not even, as a right, excluded—</p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman speaking to the question that schedule 1 be added to the Bill? He is referring to schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was optional. I am asking why lighthouse keepers are not included in schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am relieved, Mr. Gourlay, to hear that I am in order. I should not like to transgress in any way. My reference to schedule 3 was only a passing one. The Juries (Lighthouse Keepers Exemption) Act 1869 is repealed—not just parts of the Act, but the whole of it—in schedule 3. I assumed that it had been repealed because the lighthouse keepers had been properly included in a category in schedule 1, but I cannot find them in the schedule. I am anxious to hear from the Minister why I cannot find them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to ask the Minister about the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. As the hon. and learned Gentleman will remember, section 8 of that Act states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No Commissioner, collector, officer, or person employed under the authority of the Commissioners in relation to inland revenue, shall be compelled to serve as a mayor or sheriff or in any corporate or parochial or other public office or employment, or on any jury or inquest whatsoever".</p></blockquote>
That, too, is a casualty of the Bill, and those people are not included among the ineligible categories. I think I understand why, but I should like to hear the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest as a Commissioner of Northern Lighthouses. The annual trip will shortly occur, and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports will have lunch with us on 8 August and visit a lighthouse thereafter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this outing the Solicitor-General's equivalent of Glasgow corporation's sludge boat outing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be quite good sludge on board, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it is paid for voluntarily out of private funds and not compulsorily out of public funds taken from the pockets of those who would never provide sludge for any Glasgow councillor if they could avoid doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to advise the hon. Gentleman that, alas, lighthouse keepers are a diminishing breed. I regret to say that that is because more and more lights are automatic and fewer and fewer stations are manned. However, thanks to the trade union concerned, most of the lighthouses are not now residential. Lighthouse keepers do three months or a month off, and a week on. We have rotating lighthouse men.
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
For much of the time they are not stuck in Skerry of Ness or Muckle Flugga but are on a shore station, and I may say that that is a matter of some controversy. There is no reason why during his month off at a shore station a lighthouse man should not serve on a jury. If he happens to be on Muckle Flugga—he would not be on Rockall, because there is only an unmanned light beacon on Rockall—in the middle of a force 12 gale, it is unlikely that he will not be excused jury service on cause shown. Therefore it is no longer necessary to exclude lighthouse keepers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1869, as the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will clearly remember, lighthouse men were resident in lighthouses—often inaccessibly resident for six months, a year or perhaps years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The citation could not have been delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the delivery of the citation might have presented some difficulties. That may have been the reason for the exclusion. Whatever it was, times have changed, and, just as a lighthouse man who is ill can be taken to hospital in a very short time from any lighthouse—except in the most exceptional circumstances—there seems no reason to exempt lighthouse men from jury service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which trade union secured the improvement in conditions that the Solicitor-General described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I would be in order to disclose such sensitive information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means that he does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not mean that I do not know. It is just that I think that the inquiring mind of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I keep confusing the hon. Member's political orientation with his constituency. His inquiring mind will be able to find out which union obtained the benefit for our lighthousemen.

I do not know the origins of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
exclusion, but I would rather have Inland Revenue officers sitting on a jury than interfering with my financial affairs. I see no reason why they should be exempted if other civil servants are not. I certainly do not wish to exempt tax gatherers—or publicans as they were called in biblical times—from anything except tax-gathering. So long as publicans in the modern sense can serve on juries, I see no reason why publicans in the biblical sense should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely convinced. That is hard on Inland Revenue inspectors who are labouring to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement in the interests of the Solicitor-General's more sophisticated financial colleagues. I would have expected them to have good cheer from him and not merely be hied off to jury service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also slightly depressed by the information that the Solicitor-General, as a Commissioner of the Northern Lighthouses, envisages unfortunate employees labouring away in Muckle Flugga for a month, coming back on shore for a well-earned month's rest and spending it entirely in the High Court in Perth. That does not sound like an enlightened employer's attitude, but I suppose we shall have to be content with it. I will take his word that it is not necessary to include lighthouse keepers, but I have minor doubts. He said that they are a dying breed—so are law apprentices, but they have been excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a case, given the broad way in which the schedule has been drafted, for including those working in the lighthouse service. The Solicitor-General has declared an interest, and if he is satisfied that there is no such necessity, I do hot suppose the Committee should get over-anxious. I am content to let the matter rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical amendment. It is not one which is likely to dominate tomorrow's headlines, but it is a matter of some interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 deals with certain amendments to the Trusts (Scotland) Act 1921. I do not pretend to have done a great deal of trust work at any time in my career. In fact, I regard it with some aversion, but it has been represented to me that the term "marriage contract" that occurs in line 31 in page 7 and line 1 in page 8 is, in the words of the Law Society of Scotland,
	<br><blockquote><p>"not a term of art which is readily understood in Scottish legal circles".</p></blockquote>
In its memorandum the Law Society has suggested—I have discussed it with the Society—that the term "marriage contract" should be removed and
	<br><blockquote><p>"trust established by an ante-nuptial or postnuptial contract of marriage"</p></blockquote>
should be substituted. That is more for clarification than trying to put it in language that is more familiar to the everyday solicitor, going about his everyday business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society was good enough to provide me with a letter that it received from the Scottish Courts Administration on 21 September 1979—signed by a Mr. Robert Brodie—in which this matter was dealt with in a somewhat peremptory manner. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 23 of the Trusts (Scotland) Act 1921 uses the term marriage contract. In view of this and of the fact that the term marriage contract trust is readily understood we do not think that there is any need to make your proposed amendment".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps Mr. Brodie and the Scottish Courts Administration think that it is a term that is readily understood, but the Law Society of Scotland does not agree with them. The Law Society, perhaps, is in better touch with the views of people who works in this field than the Scottish Courts Administration. It is a matter of no principle, it is merely a matter of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the argument of the Law Society. I would have thought that "a marriage contract" would be understood by even such simple persons as the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) with his delightful naivety. It may be stretching his understanding of the English language more to imagine that words such as ante- and post-nuptial—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but the only thing that I can imagine that the Law Society has in mind is that "marriage contract" might imply a contract entered into by two persons who are married to each another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic or illogic of that is not overcome by the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"ante-nuptial or post-nuptial contract of marriage",</p></blockquote>
because in a way it is Irish to talk about an ante-nuptial contract of marriage. One cannot have an ante-nuptial contract of marriage. Therefore, if that is the hon. Gentlemen's dilemma, which I concede it may be, it is not cured by their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "marriage contract" is used in the Trusts (Scotland) Act, in every insurance policy and is on the tongue of any lawyer—in my enormous trust practice I always use the term "marriage contract." My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) and I used to walk up and down the floor of Parliament House for hours talking about marriage contracts. My hon.

	<div class='title'>REMIT FROM SHERIFF COURT TO COURT OF SESSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 9, line 35, after ' the', insert 'joint'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in page 9, line 36, leave out 'any of' and insert 'all'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a more substantial point, on which I wish to press the Ministers quite hard. Clause 12 gives a sheriff the power to remit a matter to the Court of Session, and the suggestion is that that may be done by the sheriff court on the motion of any of the parties to the cause, if the sheriff believes the importance or difficulty of the cause makes it appropriate. I do not in principle object to the power to remit, but it is unwelcome that it should be not only at the discretion of the sheriff —clearly that is one necessary safeguard— but also that it should, or can, be on the motion of one of the parties only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument will be familiar to the Under-Secretary, and I need only sketch it. There is a case for saying that people have a right to choose the forum in which their case is to be tried. If the action, having been raised in the sheriff court, is to be transferred to the Court of Session, it should be by common consent of both or all parties to the action, and should also have the concurrence of the sheriff who makes the order. That goes without saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an a important matter of principle —a "fundamental right", in the words of the Law Society, with which I agree. The citizen has a right to choose the forum in which the proceedings he raises are to be heard, and they should not be shifted simply because one of the parties wishes them to go to the Court of Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
It is a matter of some importance, to choose one's forum. A considerable difference in expenses may arise if a case transfers to the Court of Session. If a case is in the Glasgow sheriff court, for example, and the proposal is made that it should go to Edinburgh, one will be involved in instructing Edinburgh solicitors and counsel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for that. That may all be justified by the extra skill and care taken in the Court of Session. However, if the person who has not made the motion to transfer is at the losing end at the end of the day, and if, as is normal in the law of Scotland, expenses go with success, he may be met with much greater expenses than if the case had remained in the sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments simply ensure that any remit under section 12 shall be on the joint motion of the parties and not merely on the motion of one of the parties. That is sought for the two easily understandable reasons which I have outlined to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said. He will appreciate that two possibilities are allowed under the clause in its present form. The sheriff may at his discretion, on application by either party, allow remit to the sheriff court, or in certain cases—relating to the custody and adoption of children—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not concerned with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is not concerned about that, but it is an instance where the sheriff may on his own initiative, even if there has been no application from either party, consider the remit appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Gentleman's reasons for suggesting that it might be considered unfair to allow the sheriff to grant such a motion if only one of the parties had applied. His reasons, in effect, are that one of the parties, perhaps with far greater resources than the other, might seek, for unfair and improper reasons— though that would not be said explicitly— to have the matter referred to the Court of Session because the availability of resources would give him an advantage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
compared with a pursuer who did not have such resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a powerful and convincing case if the mere application by one of the parties led to the matter being automatically remitted to the Court of Session. In other words, if there were no discretion with the sheriff and it were simply that if either party wanted the case remitted it had to be, there would be a powerful case for the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that that is not what the clause provides. Even if an application is made, not only is it dependent on the discretion of the sheriff, but the sheriff has to be satisfied on certain matters stated in the clause before he can grant such a motion. He has to be of the opinion that either
	<br><blockquote><p>"the importance or difficulty of the clause make it appropriate"</p></blockquote>
to remit the matter to the Court of Session. Therefore, the onus will be on the party seeking a remit to show to the sheriff's satisfaction that the importance or the difficulty of the cause justifies such a remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other party will be perfectly entitled to oppose such an application. It is not a question of a motion being moved by one party and the other party having no opportunity to comment. If the other party takes a different view, it will be able to put its point of view. The sheriff will have heard both sets of argument, but only if he is satisfied that the importance or the difficulty of the cause justifies a remit will he be entitled to grant it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, it is up to the sheriff to make that decision. I can envisage the sheriff who has been with the case not recognising its importance or difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost by definition that tends to remove its importance or difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the sheriff himself cannot do it if neither party wants it, unless the matter relates to custody of children. Only then would the sheriff be able on his own initiative to decide to remit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases, if either party makes the application and it is not supported by both parties—or even if it is supported by both parties—the sheriff can still refuse.
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
If the sheriff is not satisfied that the importance or the difficulty justifies a remit, he can still refuse the motion, even if there is unanimity by both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is nothing to stop either party raising the motion in the Court of Session at the start. If the pursuer chooses to raise his action in the Court of Session, the defender has no choice but to defend it there, even if his resources are far smaller than those of the pursuer. That cannot be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only the defender who would be likely to make such an application. If the pursuer had wished to do so, he would have raised the action in the first place in the Court of Session. But where the defender feels that the difficulty or importance of the action is such that it is not right for the sheriff court to deal with it but that it is something which justifies consideration by the Court of Session. So, the defender makes the application but only if the sheriff, having heard both sides, agrees with him and is satisfied that importance and difficulty are factors which justify remit to the Court of Session would the application be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not unfair. It does not give a defender who might wish to use the power for improper reasons the opportunity to do so. It is a matter not of his discretion, but of the sheriff's. We can be reasonably satisfied that the sheriff would not be inclined to grant such an order unless he was satisfied that the requirements as laid down in the statute were fully complied with. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman that this proposal is reasonable and eminently sensible, given that the ultimate decision rests with the sheriff. His discretion is not unfettered and he is required to conform to the statute requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have some lingering doubts about the matter. I am not concerned with the second proposition, which deals only with cases of adoption and matters of that sort. I am more interested in the main provision—namely, the remit of a wide variety of actions to the Court of Session. My understanding is that it evolved from recommendation 41 of the Grant committee report. It has been lying around for a long time and has not been taken up in any law reform Bill, although there were good reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the point that if a forum has been chosen, there is benefit in allowing that right to remain unless there is a general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
agreement that it should shift. I accept the Under-Secretary's point that if the action is raised in the Court of Session, the defender is lumbered with that court. Structurally, we can do nothing about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Grant committee. He will be interested to know that, for the reasons of expense about which he is concerned, the one recommendation of the Grant committee in this sphere which we did not accept was that such a motion should be heard by the Court of Session. Its recommendation was that if there were a proposal for remit, only the Court of Session should hear that application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took the view that, partly for reasons of expense, it would be unfair to require the parties to appear before the Court of Session in view of the extra expense which that entailed. It seemed sensible to assume that the sheriff who had been dealing with the case until that time would have a better awareness about whether the difficulty or complexity of the case justified a remit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One should be thankful for small mercies. I am grateful that the departure from the true writ, according to the Grant committee, was made. A pursuer may choose to raise an action in the sheriff court and the defender, perhaps a person of more substantial means, may decide that it would be an excellent idea if the matter were taken to the Court of Session. Therefore he may make that motion on his own account and persuade the sheriff— I agree that he has to do that—that it falls within the category of importance or difficulty. If that happens, the other party may be considerably embarrassed. He may find himself in a forum where the expenses are much higher and where they will escalate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to sound as though I am taking up every point made by the Law Society, but it is a matter about which it feels strongly and on which it has made serious representations to me and to other members of the committee. I am not happy about the matter, although I shall not press it to a Division today. But, after further thought and advice, we might wish to return to it in what may be a brief Report stage. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
hope the Minister will reconsider the matter, particularly the two points of principle about the right to choose the forum and the expense involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has made his usual sophisticated attempt to gloss over the matter and put it in an acceptable context, the two points remain. I shall not abandon the subject altogether, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>POWER OF JUDGES TO ACT AS ARBITERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 10, line 24, after "Session", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>agrees that the said appointment can be appropriately undertaken by a Senator of the College of Justice and".</p></blockquote>
This is a matter of some curious interest. As the Committee will remember, the effect of clause 13 is to allow a senator of the College of Justice power to act as arbiter or oversman where a dispute appears to him to be of a commercial character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question I wish to ask— perhaps it will be convenient to do so now rather than on clause stand part— is for a definition of the difference between an arbiter and an oversman. It is something with which I am not familiar. I recognise that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has expertise in this area and he may wish to contribute to this short debate in a minute or two. It would certainly be welcome if he gave the Committee the benefit of his intelligent experience in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, as a humble practitioner, I am afraid that I do not know what an oversman is as distinct from an arbiter and I will be glad if the Minister will enlighten the Committee and say a word or two about the sort of commercial disputes in which he thinks senators of the College of Justice are likely to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the conditions which allow such arbitration to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
take place. Clause 13(1) stales that a senator:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not accept such appointment unless the Lord President of the Court of Session has informed him that, having regard to the state of business in that court, he can be made available to do so."</p></blockquote>
I presume that the idea is simply that if there is a great press of litigation and the full team is required, as one might say, someone will not be allowed to slough himself off into an arbitration dispute which may last for many days. I suspect that a complicated dispute could last for many weeks. It seems perfectly reasonable that the first duty of a senator is to his court as that of a member of the College of Justice is to the Court of Session and that he should make sure that he will not in some way obstruct the proper operation of that court by going off on a legal trip of his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to provide that the Lord President should also have to agree not just that the senator can go in terms of the court but that he can go in terms in which:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the said appointment can be appropriately undertaken".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that in this case the word "appropriately" is intended to mean that it is the sort of arbitration in which, properly and without in any way taking away from the dignity of the Court of Session, a senator of the College of Justice can take part. That might be described as a somewhat subjective view to be taken by the Lord President but it might well be a wise provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fees payable for the services of a Senator of the College of Justice as arbiter or oversman shall be—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) payable in the Court of Session".</p></blockquote>
I presume that means payable into the Court of Session and not retained by the senator himself but perhaps we should have that matter clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the amendment provides a useful exercise because it will allow the Minister to say quite a bit about the way in which these commercial disputes will be taken on and what criteria he expects individual senators to apply when accepting them. I do not know to what extent that sort of work is undertaken at present. I had assumed, as we are legislating to allow senators of the College of Justice to undertake that sort
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
of arbitration work, that they cannot do so at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about that but I can raise a specific case which has received widespread publicity—namely, the activities of Lord Wheatley. Lord Wheatley, who is a distinguished member —indeed, the second most senior member—of the College of Justice, appeared recently as an arbiter as I understood the case. He was arbitrating between Partick Thistle and Rangers football clubs as to whether a certain gentleman was worth £80,000, £280,000 or whatever else in terms of his transfer fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am curious to know—I do not mean this in any hostile sense—under what statutory authority Lord Wheatley undertook that particular arbitration. Clearly, to decide what a transfer fee should be is a commercial arbitration. I am curious about what authority he had for so doing, because only now do we appear to be allowing a senator of the College of Justice to undertake that sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned this to the Under-Secretary and the Solicitor-General previously so that they could explain the position to me. It is not in any way a hostile inquiry, as I say, but it seems reasonable, at least prima facie, to ask about the matter, given that Lord Wheatley has been able to take on this work, highly publicised work, presumably for a fee, which—no doubt the Solicitor-General can tell us—went to the court's administration and not to his Lordship personally; although perhaps it is possible to undertake these duties in one's own time without a fee. In any event, a query arises about the level of discretion presently existing and whether in fact we need this legislation now at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that matter as an example. Perhaps we can now leave the subject until we hear what the Solicitor-General has to say about the present practices and whether he agrees that there is a case for saying that clearance should be obtained by the Lord President not just upon the demands which the court time will make on senators but also on the suitability of the arbitration they intend to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, we place very strict conditions upon the scale of judges' operations. The Solicitor-General will remember that when Lord Avonside
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
took it upon himself to join a totally apolitical committee that was looking into the principles and problems of devolution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any rate it was a Conservative front organisation, in the view of some of us, and Lord Avonside decided ultimately that his position would not allow of his membership. We are very careful in what we allow senators to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest for a moment that Lord Wheatley appearing between two gentlemen to decide whether a footballer is worth £80,000 or £200,000. what his skill and body is worth, is necessarily demanding to the dignity of the senators of the College of Justice, but it raises certain questions about the machinery used and whether there should not be some oversight of the way that this activity is carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly said, clause 13(1) contains this limitation—the arbitration agreement has to be one where the dispute appears to the senator to be of a commercial character. What is considered by the Under-Secretary or the Solicitor-General to be the restriction imposed by this limitation of the character being only commercial? Am I to understand that building contracts, for example, which frequently include an arbitration clause, would be included within "commercial character"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that of the situation where the senator has, prior to his elevation to the bench, been conducting an arbitration. As I understand the provison to clause 13(1) effectively he is not able to accept that appointment unless the Lord President of the Court of Session has given him leave either in the restrictive fashion that appears in the clause at present or in the rather wider fashion that the hon. Member for Garscadden has suggested in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because I think that it is important and of general commercial value, I should like to be assured that a senator of the College of Justice would be able to continue with an arbitration in which he had previously been engaged
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
prior to his elevation to the bench. This might present a difficulty, and it would be of value in a restricted number of cases if he could be entitled to continue. Possibly there is no difficulty but I should be grateful for further reassurance on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point raised by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), I turn briefly to amendment No. 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing amendment No. 18 at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reply briefly to the important points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). Yes, building contracts would be included. On Second Reading, when the matter was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus, whose memory seems less strong than his diligence, the answer I gave was "Yes, if he were considered appropriate by the Lord President and if it were appropriate at that time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine, with all the balance of factors, that if a person were appointed to the Bench while in the middle of a long arbitration, the Lord President would say "No, it is not appropriate that you continue because of the business of the court. They will have to start their arbitration all over again with the expense that that involves. Therefore, I think it extremely unlikely that in any circumstances the answer would be other than "Yes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raise by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr Dewar). As I understand it, although I would not like to be taken as an authority on the subject, Lord Wheatley was acting in a voluntary, unpaid capacity in sorting out a football dispute, with his long association with football. He was the chairman, so to speak, of a panel which decided it. It was not an arbitration brought under the Arbitration (Scotland) Act 1894.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am horrified that a hack of the Law Society of Scotland of such distinction as the hon. Member for Garscadden is not aware of that Act. He would know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
what an oversman was if he had read the Act, because it is defined in section 4. An oversman is somebody to whom two arbiters who disagree, or four arbiters who are two-all, can remit the matter to come to a decision. If they cannot decide on the oversman, there is procedure under section 4 for deciding how he shall be chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large number of commercial people with serious contracts, such as building contracts, have long wanted to obtain the expertise of senators of the College of Justice to arbitrate. The funds do not go to them. It would not, in my opinion, be appropriate to say that the Lord President must decide whether the senators are suitable for this particular case. They can make such a judgment perfectly well. I should be extremely surprised if the parties who wished to have a senator as an arbiter would nominate somebody who was inappropriate in the circumstances. Obviously certain counsel who have become judges specialise in arbitration much more than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that answers the point. I think that the provision will be extremely useful. It will mean that arbitrations will be swifter and thus cheaper, which is in the interests of both parties to the arbitration. It is considered to be a great improvement in arbitration law. I can see no difficulties about it. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw clause 13 and to read the Arbitration (Scotland) Act 1894.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
