	<p>Government amendments Nos. 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177 and 178.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is being brought in with a large number of confused, confusing and lengthy Government amendments. I should like to say in passing that for those of us who have been trying to do an honest tradesman's job on the Bill it is a little disconcerting that an Administration with all the apparatus of government should bring forward such complicated amendments at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it might be useful for the Committee to have the amendments set out in the length in which they have been put in the Amendment Paper, it is difficult for us, when we are confronted with them at such a late stage of our proceedings. Once again it is a reminder that the Government have not really given sufficient
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
thought to the consequences of what they are doing in this innovation. Whet they have seen as a minor matter is crucial, in fact, and made all the more so partly just because it is minor and in the middle of the accusatorial system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had to preface my speech on the amendment with those remarks because my simple, honest amendment has been lumped in with those complicated Government amendments. It just states that if there is to be a transcript—I remind hon. Gentlemen that the Thomson committee recommended tape recording—in a way other than tape recording, although we should still press for that, that must be done by neither procurator fiscal staff nor the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is no indictment of the staff or the police. The amendment merely seeks to ensure that people such as shorthand writers in a court of law are used. Because the system is to be run by the procurator fiscal, it seems wrong to us that, now his accusatorial role is combined with that of the inquisitorial one of 	<i>ajuge d’instruction,</i> we forget his other role of prosecution. Therefore it should not be his staff which makes the transcript.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the bare bones of the matter. The justification is not to make a criticism or even an implied one, but is concerned with the number of complaints and problems that will arise if there are any challenges to the transcript. We should remember that the matter has not yet come to court, that there has not been a judgment and that the position is a pre-accusatorial one, without there having been an oath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been made clear that the sheriff will not conduct the proceedings but the procurator fiscal. Therefore it is manifest that if there are not to be permanent grudges, complaints, challenges and questions about the transcript it should be made by those who are not under the supervision of the procurator fiscal. If matters were to be pushed further into court none of us would consider that the prosecutor—the Solicitor-General, for example—should be able to direct or appear to be in control of the transcript; nor would he want thta.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that we shall be erecting a system of pre-trial questioning to such an extent that it must be seen to have at least the safeguards of a trial. The matter has been shot into the Bill from the beginning, although the Government have not under-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
stood it. The process of detention and judicial examination is pre-trial, but it builds up to a trial. Matters become more monstrous as each discussion takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a simple layman's approach which says, in effect "All right. Let us make it clear. We shall remove an element of complaint and give a safeguard." It is analagous to the point that was made in respect of public tribunal complaints and is in the interest of both the prosecution and defence that the transcript should be acceptable by both sides. That means it must be impeccable in its objectivity and source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that the amendment seeks. It would be helpful for the Committee if the battery— I use the word advisedly, not only in respect of the numbers but of the language; one of the amendments extends to over a page in the Amendment Paper—of amendments were to be explained. Therefore I hope that the Solicitor-General will speak to his amendments so that we can have a grasp of what is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is, That the amendment be made—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it possible for the Solicitor-General to explain through you why he chose not to speak to his amendments? We are taking the amendments together. If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not speak to his amendments it puts us in a difficult situation. I have tried to help him, as I tried on a previous amendment. It is essential that the large group of subsiantial Government amendments should be introduced as a preliminary to our discussion, so that we know what we are dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the agility of the solicitors' branch of the profession. I cannot jump to my feet as fast as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I am more than happy to assist the Committee on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to understand what the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is if it is not a criticism of the procurator fiscal staff. The only reason
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
that could be advanced for a ban on using shorthand writers who happen to be in the procurator fiscal's employment is that they cannot be trusted to be accurate. There is no other basis for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendments more than meet the hon. Gentlemans apparent fears. They would introduce exactly the system proposed by Thomson. They provide that only the questions and answers that are acceptable will be recorded. If, for instance, a question is ruled out of order by the sheriff, there will be no transcript of that irrelevant matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[	<b>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</b> 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Solicitor-General assist us by detailing the types of questions that may be ruled out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-Feneral for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the revised section 20A(2) he will see that a leading question, for example, would be out of order. If the accused were asked "You did break into the bank, didn't you?" the sheriff would rule the question out of order. The transcript would not be required to read "Question: You did break into the bank, didn't you? Sheriff: That question is inadmissable." The transcript will therefore consist only of the acceptable material. It is most important to understand—I should like the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West to pay attention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is listening. I wish him to take the matter on board, as I am sure that that will shorten out proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheriff is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the transcript. Objections as to its accuracy can be made by either the prosecution or the defence. That is a judicial process, and I therefore see no risk of any prejudice arising from the fact that the person taking the record happens to be in the employment of the procurator fiscal service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I think the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, it is monstrously expensive to have fully qualified court shorthand writers, who are already difficult to obtain and in constant demand to the extent that many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
courts cannot sit because of their absence, to take this relatively simple matter. I beg him to understand that the question whether there is any inaccuracy in the record can be challenged by the prosecutor or the defence. It will be a short record. The sheriff is the arbiter of that matter. Therefore, the safeguard which the hon. Gentleman perhaps thought was a matter of concern lest there was any breach of natural justice is not liable to gice rise in any circumstance to dishonesty or inaccuracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this question of the staff employed by the procurator fiscal who are in short supply for court work, would the same type of staff be used for the proceedings that we are discussing? Would they necessarily have to be shorthand writers who have specialised in court proceedings? Would it not be suitable simply to use persons qualified in shorthand?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a large difference between the types of staff, but I should have thought that in such court proceedings the normal court shorthand writer would not necessarily be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I fully understood that question, because I had some difficulty in hearing what the hon. Gentleman said. In order to be a court shorthand writer, particularly a court shorthand writer with that rather complicated modulation machine like a deaf-and-dumb typewriter, one has to be extremely highly trained and extremely highly paid. I know that there are shorthand writers and shorthand writers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the press has gone, perhaps I can say that it has always amazed me that there is the world's press in some important case writing down in shorthand everything that is said and then they come to one afterwards and ask "Excuse me, what was the name of the accused and what did you say?" But that is no criticism of the press. It is merely to say that some people are better at shorthand than others. But the procurator fiscal would supply a competent person who was capable of taking down shorthand, but who did not have the advanced qualifications of a court shorthand writer, who requires a great deal of training and qualification, is very expensive and is not available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Solicitor-General for giving an answer to my amendment. I had sat down so that he could deal with this series of massive Government amendments being taken with mine. I can deal with his criticism of my amendment in a moment, but we are concerned with the string of Government amendments being discussed with my amendment. I thought that he had accepted a proposition to the Chair that they should be dealt with by him, because they are so long. Government amendment No. 157 takes up a whole page. I thought that the Committee, the Chair, the Solicitor-General and myself had accepted that he should deal with those amendments of mine. We thought that he was about to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with the amendments. They provide for the taking of an accurate record, which in my submission is perfectly proper. As the hon. Member will appreciate, Thomson also suggests that there should be a tape recording of judicial examination, and it is our intention that there should be one. Therefore, the question of an accurate record is not in doubt. That is what the amendments obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General has said that the amendments are about an efficient record of the proceedings of this judicial inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I refer to the later ones in this list, such as amendments Nos. 164 to 170. Amendment No. 164 is the best example. It states: leave out "It" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to sections 20B(2) and 76(1)(	<i>b</i>) of this Act, on the application of either an accused or the prosecutor, the court may refuse to allow the record or some part of the record to be read to the jury; and at the hearing of such application it".</p></blockquote>
But that is not just about the recording of an efficient transcript; it is about how that transcript will be used. I am sure that Opposition Members would be grateful if the Solicitor-General would explain in what kind of examples there would be part of a transcript not given to the jury by the court on application, particularly by the prosecution. Those amendemnts, which go beyond those on the transcript and recording of the transcript itself, need some explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the explanation. These amendments are consequential on the amendments which make this form of recording of the judicial examination. This provision is in the Bill already and is merely a consequential alteration. Clearly, there will be things which may be said at judicial examination, which would not be competent evidence for the jury to hear. Amendment No. 164 merely corrects the text following the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I wish that the Solicitor-General would be equally helpful with the other amendments. That is a three-line amendment. But we were faced with a 40-line amendment earlier which contained a number of points of detail on none of which the Solicitor-General give any indication of the import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is becoming quite monstrous. As honourably as I could, I gave the Solicitor-General the opportunity to explain the purpose and what is meant. Subsections (7), (8) and (9) of amendment No. 157 refer to matters on which we want an explanation so as to see whether the Solicitor-General is right in saying that it does what we want it to do. It may be that it does. But I do not see that we can make much progress on that basis while the hon. and learned Gentleman is treating the Committee in this cursory manner. I wish that he would speak to his own amendments. Is he ashamed of them? Why is he not defending his own amendments? I defended mine. These amendments are lumped with mine. Could he not stand up and say what his are about and why we should accept them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to strain the Committee, but less let us be clear. Perhaps I may use the words of someone such as Burke, who said that he could provide an explanation but could not provide the comprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanation is quite simple. These Government amendments provide for the accurate recording of the judicial examination and all the other amendments are consequential upon the text which result from it. There are no lacunae and no additions apart from that. If the hon. Gentleman cares to read them he will see that. I cannot go through each amendment and lit it into the Bill so as to ask him whether he understands it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of the amendments.
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
That is the effect of them. That is the intention of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are at something of an impasse. I am sorry that we are having this difficulty because I accept that this formidable thicket of amendments tabled by the Government is, on the whole, meant to be helpful. I find most of the amendments reassuring. I fear that the reassurances are marginal matters. They do not remove my fundamental opposition to the clause. But, for all that I fear that we have to live on rather meagre rations in the Committee, as you will discover, Mr. Armstrong as the hours go by and it is at least something that we have been thrown a few crumbs here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in this large mass of amendments there are a number of amendments, in particular amendments Nos. 68, 79 and 80, which stand in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), and which have to some extent been overtaken by what has been written in by the Government, whipped on by the House of Lords and by the sceptical reception that this part of the Bill had in that other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on my feet, having said that I generally welcome most of the amendments, because there are some about which I have reservations, and because there are phrases in my own amendments which have not survived into the Government's amendments but which I think should have survived. In other words, although the Government's amendments may be, on balance, an improvement, the improvements themselves could be improved by the adoption of some of the alternatives which we have—I think helpfully and, certainly, hopefully—provided for consideration. I shall turn in a moment to that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General is being a little optimistic when he says that this jungle is merely a means of ensuring a proper and accurate recording of what happens at a judicial examination. The complications that ensued from the amendments were recognised very helpfully by Ministers, who drafted out a reconstructed clause incorporating all the amendments. It is a substantial paper, as the Committee knows. The fact that they felt it necessary to do so was because this was no matter of fine tuning or adjustment. We were getting a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
radical reconstruction and a large interpolation of new procedures within the basic shell of clause 6. It is not just a matter of a simple series of minor adjustments to set down a machinery for recording what a happens in a judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) when he drew attention to amendment No. 164. Perhaps I may start with that, although it is out of sequence, because the Committee has been looking at it for the last two or three minutes. If we look at the clause as it is now drafted, taking into account the amendments that we are considering, we find that section 151A of the 1975 Act will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to sections 20B(2) and 76(l)	<i>fb</i>) of this Act, on the application of either an accused or the prosecutor, the court may refuse to allow the record or some part of the record to be read to the jury; and at the hearing of such application it shall be competent for the defence to adduce as witnesses the persons who were present during the proceedings mentioned in subsection (1) above and for the defence and for the prosecutor to examine those witnesses upon any matters regarding the said proceedings."</p></blockquote>
I understand that. I hasten to reassure the Solicitor-General that, when we piece it together, it is in perfectly intelligible English. It needs no particular legal expertise to understand what it says. The question I ask about amendment No. 164 is whether it is necessary. That may seem a strange thing for me to say because it is, in a sense, an additional safeguard. There is the right for the defence to raise at the trial a challenge to the admissibility of certain happenings at judicial examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the hon. Member an example which was kindly given me by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram)? It concerns a case in which he appeared, in which the extra-judicial answer to caution and charge to a charge of rape was: "It wasnae rape, I've been done for that before." In other words "I know what rape is, old chap, and this was not rape." That was the answer to the caution and charge but, in that it admitted a previous conviction, it would not be competent. That is the sort of situation in which parts of judicial examination would not be competent and, even if they were competent, would not be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that is being made. It is that the defence—or
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
the prosecutor, but more likely the defence—can say "My Lord, I object to this matter going to the jury". At that point there can be a argument whether that evidence should or should not go to the jury. I use that as an example of the cumbersome machinery with which we find ourselves. A judicial examination 	<i>per se,</i> with an argument in court about admissibility, would be complicated enough. But all this is subject to sections 20B(2) and 76(1)(	<i>b</i>) of the Act, where there is a very complicated procedure. It would be unfair to say that the amendment has been sprung on us, because these amendments have been tabled for some time, but it has appeared since the proceedings in the House of Lords and sets out over many pragraphs, if not many pages, a complex and cumbersome procedure for disputing what happened at that judicial examination.

There is a judicial examination, with all the concurrent complexities to which we have referred in the course of the debate. There may then be an argument following on the serving of the copy of the transcript, which must of course happen within 14 days. Then we read that if
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (5) and (6) below … the said accused or the prosecutor is of the opinion that a transcript served under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (3) contains an error or is incomplete"</p></blockquote>
there is an appeal procedure before the sheriff. When we have passed that series of hurdles we shall proceed to court where we can have a splendid argument under section 151, as amended, of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not tried to make the procedure sound over-complicated. I could have gone through, at great length, the subsections and all the possible refinements and sophistications of this remarkable procedure. I merely sketch it in to illustrate what I believe is the fundamental difficulty of this whole new legislation. The difficulty is that it is so complicated that it will foul up, and become a considerable hindrance to, the administration of justice. Amendment No. 164 for instance, seems to take us a very long way from a simple amendment to ensure that there is an accurate recording at judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that point, I turn to the other amendments in my name and to the question of the recording of what happens at the judicial examination. I have not heard from the Solicitor-General, although I am sure I shall hear at some point, whether or not this is taken on oath. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
anxious that that should be on the record. I may have missed something in the complicated text before us, but I am not absolutely clear about that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will not object when I say that I do not support amendment No. 134. I think it is almost inevitable that this work will be done by members of the fiscal staff if they are the people who are most readily and most cheaply available. This procedure will be a very considerable cost to the public funds. A great deal of time will be taken up in the typing up, preparation and serving of transcripts. I accept that this work will almost certainly have to be done by members of the fiscal staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some members of the Committee will disagree with me, but I see nothing essentially objectionable in that, particularly as there is a right of dispute—if I can put it that way—written into the Act. Any other provision would be difficult to administer and would make a difficult situation even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point my hon. Friend is making. I would not wish to say anything against the staff of any procurator fiscal. The fact is, however, that this procedure will be taking place within the chambers of the sheriff court. It will not take place in the procurator fiscal's office, but in the sheriff's chambers. It therefore seems to me that it is the staff of the court who ought to be undertaking the recording, and not the staff of the procurator fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may have got from the Solicitor-General the answers on the pro forma idea of questioning. I might accept a shorthand writer of a lower standing than the court shorthand writers if a pro forma was being used. That would be valid. But if that is not the case and there will be an open question session, we are likely to need highly-skilled court shorthand reporters rather than the less well-trained reporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's point. It would be silly to quarrel over it. I am anxious to be helpful to the Government, too, where it is possible—although sometimes it is difficult—but my view is that the present wording
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be made by a shorthand writer"</p></blockquote>
leaves it as an open option whether it shall be a member of fiscal staff or a member of the sheriff clerk's dept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the Solicitor-General would not rule out, for example, the sheriff clerk's dept supplying the person to do this work. There is a number of well-known firms in Edinburgh which supply on a commercial basis the shorthand writers for many civil cases and other court proceedings. The important point is that the shorthand writer is sworn and is on oath to provide an accurate transcript. I presume that that shorthand writer in this instance, whether he be from the sheriff clerk's dept or from the procurator-fiscal's dept, will be sworn by the sheriff at the beginning of the proceedings. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will confirm that. On balance, I feel that to rule out the procurator fiscal's dept to supply the person who is to be put on oath would be rather restrictive. I would not vote for amendment No. 134.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is that amendments Nos. 78 and 80 appear to have been overtaken by the massive redrafting by the Government, but on more mature reflection I am not sure that that is so. Amendment No. 78 seeks to add after line 23 on page seven
	<br><blockquote><p>"the complete proceedings at any judicial examination under this section including".</p></blockquote>
The original drafting was
	<br><blockquote><p>"A 	<i>verbatim</i> record shall be made of all questions to, and answers by".</p></blockquote>
I wish to expand that to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"the complete proceedings at any judicial examination"</p></blockquote>
including
	<br><blockquote><p>"all questions to, and answers by".</p></blockquote>
I looked anxiously at this point in the Government's version in the new part of the clause. I find:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 	<i>verbatim</i> record to be made by a shorthand writer of all questions to and answers and declarations by the accused".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that that is entirely adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to what the Solicitor-General had to say about the importance of shortening the verbatim record. That is a consideration, but it is a minor one. I can see that, if a clearly improper question were asked and was ruled out of order by the sheriff so that it did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
exist, there might be some virtue in not having it in the transcript. But I am not entirely happy about the mechanics. I suppose that the Solicitor-General was envisaging a direction from the sheriff to the shorthand writer not to record that question, because we could not leave it to the shorthand writer, as he or she went along, to make a judgment on what should or should not be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the number of questions that would fall into that category would be very small. The additional recording and expenditure would be very small. I would prefer that everything that happened at the judicial examination should be recorded so that we knew the exact context in which the questions were put and the answers extracted. Any back-chat, dispute, representation, submission, or otherwise, that might be made, for example, by a defence solicitor should be recorded, too, as it might be an interesting guide and aide memoire to a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come later to a number of amendments which deal with the right of a defence solicitor to ask questions to clear away ambiguities and whether that should be conditional on the grace and favour of the sheriff or should be a matter for his own initiative. If, for example, the Government maintain their attitude that it is only with the permission of the sheriff, if there is an argument about that, it would be better if it were recorded so that it may be of use and importance if it came to one of those arguments to which I referred and which are envisaged in the new section 151A(2) of the 1975 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In brief, although amendment No. 78 is now redundant or has been overtaken, it contains a concept and a phrase which has not been but should have been imported into Government amendment No. 157, which is the major Government amendment. It would be simple for the Government to accept it in principle and agree to include it in a non-contentious and easy fashion on Report. It would take 30 seconds. I am sure that we should not object to it. I should then be happy to withdraw amendment No. 78. This looks like a small point, but it contains some substance. I hope that we shall be able to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is on amendment No. 80. It is a similar point because again it has been overtaken by the Government's major
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
reconstruction by the fundamental facelift which, as a result of efforts in another place, has been imposed upon the Government. Amendment No. 80 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proceedings at any judicial examination will be recorded by a shorthand writer duly sworn by the sheriff or recorded on tape or videotape and the transcript or relevant tape or tapes shall be lodged in court as productions at any subsequent trial."</p></blockquote>
I know that the Solicitor-General said that the Government were in favour of tape recordings in principle, but Government amendment No. 157 states that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 	<i>verbatim</i> record to be made by a shorthand writer".</p></blockquote>
I cannot remember seeing anything that would allow tape recording and video taping in the clause as drafted. It was provided for in amendment No. 80. If the Solicitor-General is in favour of tape recording in principle, even if it is not now immediately available, it should be written in as an alternative so that when it is available we shall not have to make some silly amending legislation to allow it to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tape recording and video taping may not be as expensive as people think compared with the costs of shorthand writing. In this area there is an even stronger case financially for tape recording than there is in the major battleground that took place on clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 does not now stand up, given the complex way in which the ground has been transformed by Government amendments, but it contains a really important point about allowing the option of tape recording and video taping which is not allowed for in Government amendment No. 157 and should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General, who I know will have read with care what the Law Society has said, will remember that page 11, paragraph 7.7 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In regard to the verbatim record of proceedings, the Bill is silent on what is a '	<i>verbatim</i> record'. The Council is in no doubt, and has said so before, that the present system of using shorthand writers could not cope with this proposal".</p></blockquote>
That is interesting because it is the Law Society, in cold blood, making the point that I make, which is that the whole thing is unworkable. Its considered opinion is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"shorthand writers could not cope with this proposal, and that if the proceedings must be recorded, they must be taped, and should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
played back at the subsequent trial rather than transcribed for use there."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society agrees with me both about the general practicability of the Government's scheme and also that the option of tape recording should at least be available in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Solicitor-General for assurances that if I drop amendment No. 80 he will on Report take from it the alternative of video-tape recording and bring it into section 151. That seems to be a simple matter. It is a technical matter and not the stuff of headlines, but I think that both the points that I made are genuinely helpful to the Government and can be encompassed with the minimum of difficulty and fuss. I hope that they find favour with the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Armstrong, first of all may I wish you "Good morning"? It was not my intention to say very much at this point in the proceedings and at this early hour, but I am a signatory to amendment No. 134. That may strike some people as being a little odd because I was responsible in Scotland for organising the staff of the civilian police into a trade union. It appears that I am now saying that they ought not to have the job to do. That is not what I am saying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just what my hon. Friend appears to be saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. It is just what I appear to be saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) are valid. He was saying that this is a layman's amendment, that it is an attempt to impress upon the Government the fact that there is a strong case for having an independent element in the recording of the proceedings. I believe that that was right and worth doing. But now, having considered amendment No. 80, I think that it is likely that we shall not push amendment No. 134 to a vote. It is not for me to say that but my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West will advise his hon. Friends how they may wish to react to the amendment which stands in our names. We should use the staff of the sheriff's office. That proposal has now been made by my hon. Friends the Members for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and Glasgow, Garscadden. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
sure that that meets our point, and the case for placing these proceedings on tape or video tape is made. I hope that we have at last persuaded the Government of the merits of placing these proceedings on tape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as the Solicitor-General was saying, considerable cost is attached to using staff, we could consider using both staff sworn by the sheriff, and tapes. I think that the combination is a practical proposal and that it meets the arguments that were advanced about cost. I hope, therefore, that when the Minister replies, he will feel able to concede amendment No. 80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will have gathered from the debate before the break, Mr. Armstrong, these are important amendments. I am disappointed in the Solicitor-General, because he has done himself less than justice. He, and indeed the Government, have come a fair way to meeting the points put in the other place and those already put by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I can understand to some extent the confusion of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) about the Government amendments. That is why I say that the Solicitor-General has done himself less than justice in not explaining his own amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Government amendments are merely drafting amendments. Amendments Nos. 155 and 156 are both drafting amendments, consequential on the main amendment, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden says, is amendment No. 157. While amendment No. 157 is fairly detailed, even the Solicitor-General will admit that he did not give the explanation of it to which the Committee is entitled so that it can probe further not its purpose—we know that—but its effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, in speaking particularly to amendment No. 80, which is an important and fundamental amendment, made the point that this whole question of whether the shorthand writer is on oath is a matter which we hope the Solicitor-General will clear up. But it is interesting that in amendment No. 157 the accused person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
must get a copy of the transcript of the proceedings at the judicial examination. Not only that, but once the copy of the transcript has been given to him, he then has 10 days in which he can tell the sheriff that there is an error or possibly an omission in the transcript.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making these points because I want to lead on to the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden in relation to amendment No. 80. Under the proposals contained in amendment No. 157—again I say to the Solicitor-General that we are grateful to him and the Government for the distance that they have come in meeting our points and those made in the other place—an accused person can submit to the prosecutor within 10 days that there is an omission or an error, and within 14 days the sheriff has to hear the evidence in support of that claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is what constitutes an incomplete report. I think that I am right in saying that the word "incomplete" is used in amendment No. 157. The new subsection (4) (	<i>b</i>) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"within 14 days of service under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of this subsection, apply to the sheriff for the error or incompleteness to be rectified".</p></blockquote>
The word "incompleteness" throws up certain questions, particularly in relation to amendment No. 80 which was spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it be the case, for instance, as the Solicitor-General for Scotland said when speaking to his own amendments, that leading questions will not be allowed? But when an accused person complains to the prosecutor that the record is incomplete, will that accused person have the right to claim that because the sheriff says "That is a leading question, so don't record it," the record is incomplete? Will the accused person or his solicitor have the right to claim that the report is incomplete because the exchange, about whether it was a leading question or not took place during the process of the judicial examination?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not the case, when would the Solicitor-General for Scotland consider a report of the judicial examination to be incomplete? I appreciate that it may well be that something has happened—that a page has been lost—to render the report incomplete. But there is this other area that my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
Garscadden is dealing with in amendment No. 80. It is the whole question of a sheriff saying to a shorthand writer "That is a leading question and must not be recorded." Nevertheless, an exchange takes place. Will the accused person or his representative be able to claim that the report is incomplete because that exchange took place during the judicial examination and is not recorded in the transcript?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) referred to Government amendment No. 158. I think that this amendment is a direct replacement for section 151 of the 1975 Act. Under section 151 of the 1975 Act there was a provision that if conversations that had taken place were to be heard in court—in other words read to the jury—the defence would be in a position to call as witnesses people who had been present during the giving of the statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I put a specific question to the Solicitor-General for Scotland. If, in the case of a decision, evidence taken during the judicial examination is submitted fully to a jury, will the defence be able to call as witnesses those who were present during that judicial examination? That may or may not include the shorthand writer. Nevertheless, it would be interesting for the Committee and those who read the reports of these debates to know whether there is the possibility that the principle contained in the old section 151 of the 1975 Act is to be carried or in to this Bill. This is the principle whereby the defence has the ability—and in many cases the right—to call as witnesses those who have been present, in this case at the judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point I want to make—here I support the Government—is that where there is an appeal on behalf of the accused person to the prosecutor that the record is either in error or incomplete I believe that it is right and proper that the same sheriff who presided over the judicial examination should consider that appeal. What I am not so sure about, and I should like to hear the Solicitor-General's comments upon this point, is that the sheriff's decision should be final. I am not sure that in the new area with which we are now dealing it is a good practice or principle to write into legislation that the sheriff who, first, presided over the judicial examination and, second, considered the appeal on behalf of the accused person that the report is incomplete or in error, should have the final say on that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is a very fine point and I do not say that I would go to the barricades on it, but I am anxious to know whether it has crossed the mind of the Solicitor-General that perhaps there should be another avenue of appeal whereby the matter could be finally settled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Solicitor-General comes to reply I hope he will accept that there is a great deal in what my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said about amendment No. 80' Despite the 23 Government amendments to the clause that have been tabled and the massive improvement in its content—I do not take that away from the Government but give them credit for it—I think we can all agree that there is still room for further improvement. There is no doubt in my mind that amendment No. 80 would be an improvement, but even if the Solicitor-General does not now feel able to accept it I hope he will tell the Committee that he is prepared to reexamine it, and perhaps return to the matter on Report with a view to incorporating the words of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the cross questioning and duscussion that has taken place in the Committee the matter has become clearer since we began our consideration of this group of amendments. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West will want to press his amendment, but I have a feeling that he may wish to withdraw it against the background of the debate that has taken place. Having said what I have and the Solicitor-General having heard my hon. Friends the Members for Garscadden, Renfrewshire, West and Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), I hope that we may have answers to some of the quite searching questions that have been asked during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I thank the Government for the distance they have travelled towards meeting many of the points made both in the other place and during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief on these amendments. I accept what was said by my hon. Friend, but it seems that the Government have come some way towards the recording of the proceedings in a much more legitimate way than was the case with the original Bill. I believe that this was due to pressure in the other place and from other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to talk briefly about the points
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
raised by amendment No. 80 concerning tape recording or video taping. Somehow the Government should make provision for that on Report with their own amendment and I think that it would be quite simple for them to do so. Essentially, the prosecutor should provide for a verbatim report of all questions, which is in amendment No. 157, to be made by a shorthand writer, or recorded on tape or video tape. Those words inserted at that point would allow that to be done simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not have that, as my hon. Friend said, in five years' time when it is shown that it would be a lot cheaper to use tape recorders or video tape recorders, there will have to be a small Bill, or order, or something of that sort, to enable that to be done. But it can be put in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, even now it would probably be cheaper to use tape recorders—I accept that it would not necessarily be cheaper on vidoe tape at present—even with their drawbacks than to employ court shorthand writers who, as the Solicitor-General said, are highly expensive and are likely to become even more so. I believe that they will become a rarer animal Modern technology in tape recording, the use of audio-typing skills and the introduction of word processors instead of typewriters will mean that fewer people will be trained in shorthand. There will be training for different skills. Perhaps only in this place and in courts will shorthand writers be required. Therefore the need and demand for them will be quite small. As a result, the law of the market place will operate and their value will go up. They will be able to demand a higher price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it may be found that shorthand recording is a very expensive way of proceeding. Indeed, that may be true today; I do not know whether the Solicitor-General has any costings. It may now be cheaper to use tape recording or even videotape recording—which in my view would be the ideal way. But certainly in the near future it will be a lot cheaper. Therefore I hope that the Solicitor-General will come back to the matter on Report and put in those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reply briefly to the points that have been made. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) raised two matters concerning the oath.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
He asked whether the accused person would be on oath. My answer is Yes. It is important that the accused should not be able to say "I was not on oath then, although I am now." That would be ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the issue of whether the shorthand writer will be sworn on the present oath of 	<i>de fideli administratione</i> that he will faithfully take down what is said. That is impossible when there can be challenges from either side about accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shorthand writer would swear that what he said was accurate and then perhaps two people would say that it was inaccurate. At present, there is no challenge to the record of a shorthand writer who takes the oath. It is not possible for the defence, the prosecution, the Appeal Court or anyone else to challenge the record, which is absolute. It would not matter if someone were to say "But the word 'not' is missed out of every sentence." It is sworn to be a true record. Therefore in circumstances under which a challenge is permitted, there could not be an oath that the record was immaculate. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our original intention was to put all the procedure in an Act of Adjournal. It was indicated in another place that there was a preference that it should be on the face of the Bill. For that reason, the amendments are lengthy. I apologise for that. We have transferred the procedure from what would have been an Act of Adjournal, and I hope that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire West (Mr. Buchan) understands that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention to use tape recorders. I am interested that the hon. Member for Garscadden, in amendment No. 80, gives an alternative. But it is not a cheaper method or alternative. The tape recorder takes a complete record which then has to be transcribed and excised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes. The hon. Member for Garscadden would not have me as prosecutor playing a tape recording of a judicial examination in which one of the questions asked by the procurator-fiscal was "Did you say 'I have often been in prison before but I did not commit this offence'?" That would be unfair and incompetent. Therefore, there would have to be a transcript—in fact, a double transcript.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be useful to put that on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
face of the Bill, but it is our intention that it should be a change which could be introduced by administrative action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. and learned Gentleman not agree that as the amendment is worded it might be possible for a defence solicitor to challenge the fact that there was a tape recorder on during the proceedings recording what was taking place? As at present worded, the amendment is not clear that a recording can be made. The only record that the amendment states can be taken is that taken by a shorthand writer. If there is nothing to say that a tape recorder can be used, is there not the possibility of a challenge by a defence solicitor, who does not want a tape recorder used? He could say "What is that tape recorder doing there? You have no right to have it on. I am challenging it. Therefore, please take it away."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Records are taken by persons either by tape recorder or by employing a shorthand writer of their own. I can think of one notorious case where that happened. Subject to it not being a disturbance or a contempt of court, there could be no challenge to the taking of an independent record by whatever means. I hope that explanation satisfies the hon. Gentleman,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) raised two other matters. The first was to ask what was "incompleteness". "Incompleteness", as opposed to "error" might be where someone claimed that what he said in answer to the caution and charge was "Of course I did not do it. How could I have?", and the second half was missed out. That is not an error, in the proper sense of error, but something that has been omitted. Even the word "not" might be omitted, which is not an error, but the reply would certainly be incomplete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked "Can an accused person call anyone?" We have merely taken the same concept of the judicial declaration in order that people can call witnesses. It practically never happens, but they might want to call witnesses in order to record what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question whether the sheriff's decision should be final. Nobody else will be there. One cannot appeal to the sheriff principal or anyone else to say whether the sheriff is right or

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amendment No. 134 with which I am concerned. I have heard what has been said. If some of it had been said earlier, it would have been helpful. May I reiterate that there was no intention in the amendment to cast any aspersions on the staff of the procurator-fiscal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was designed to ensure not only that justice was done, but that justice was seen to be done—and, more important, was accepted that it should be done, so that there would be no complaints.

I have looked at amendment No. 80 again and I am willing to withdraw amendment No. 134 if my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) intends to vote on amendment No. 80. Amendment No. 80 now becomes slightly difficult in relation to the Government's own amendment. If my hon. Friend tells me that he intends to stand by amendment No. 80, I would encourage my hon. Friends who have associated themselves with me to support it, and, to expedite the proceedings of the Bill, I shall withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be even briefer. I listened with interest to what the Solicitor-General said. I particularly appreciated the careful and courteous way in which he dealt with the point about the shorthand writer on oath. It had never occurred to me. I accept it as a perfectly logical explanation and I am happy to leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 is the one with which I would propose to proceed. I do so with a slight blush, because I recognise that, in the unlikely event of various hon. Members remaining asleep on the Opposition Benches, we would be left with an anomaly in the Bill. As it stands, given the subsequent amendments moved or put on the Amendment Paper by the Government, the Bill would not make a great deal of sense. It would be a useful gesture, however, because I am totally dissatisfied with the Solicitor-General's explanation on tape recording. He may be right about the expense argument, but as he has said that he is in favour of tape recording, it is something of a side issue. To say that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
was not worth putting into "the face of the Bill"—which I believe was the phrase he used—and that it might be done at some future date administratively, is weak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are all agreed that tape recording is an option that we should be looking at and which we may one day want to use, I can see no harm at all—I can see positive virtue—in getting it into the Bill now. We shall then all know where we stand and we do not need to bother again with orders or amending legislation and all the other paraphernalia which will keep us out of our beds all of tonight and, perhaps, a lot of tomorrow as well at the rate that we are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in order to underline that point that I invite my hon. Friends to vote on amendment No. 80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 6, leave out lines 11 to 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all punch drunk with the punishment as we move relentlessly through the amendments, but I am encouraged by the signs of life that break out all around me. In moving amendment No. 73 I intimate now that it is something that I would wish to push to a Division if the Government are not prepared to accept it. It is an amendment of substance and importance, and I hope that we shall have a good debate and some movement from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is—as the Committee will have realised—an attack on a certain aspect of judicial examination. It is not a wrecking amendment. It is clear that there would be a considerable narrowing of the scope of judicial examination if the amendment were successful. But judicial examination would survive, and those who take the view that it has a useful role to play would still be left with a substantial judicial innovation. But I do not deny that its scope would be narrowed. Judicial examination would be restricted to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the alleged making by the accused, to or in the hearing of an officer of police, of an extrajudicial confession (whether or not a full admission) relevant to the charge".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
We shall be dealing only with examination into extrajudicial confession, and the amendment would take out section 20A (1)(	<i>a</i>), which allows the extrajudicial examiners to inquire into the matters averred in the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will have heard—or may have been conscious of—my earlier arguments about the difficulties of knowing that a special defence is relevant and, indeed, exists at the point where judicial examination takes place, at least in normal circumstances, on the first lawful day after arrest. I mentioned that we do not know exactly when the crime took place. There may be quite a broad time bracket, and therefore one does not know whether one has an alibi. That is a common circumstance. There may be all sorts of problems in terms of shame or of wanting to avoid another offence. Those arguments would explain why someone might not come up with a special defence at that early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also technicalities about what constitutes self-defence. A client may think that he has a defence when he has not. I can think of cases in my own knowledge when it was realised only very late that there was a need to lodge a special defence. In such circumstances, the broadening of the judicial examination into the matters averred in the charge seems to me dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend, however, to leave the extrajudicial confession. If there is a case for judicial examination—and I have grave doubts about it—the idea that someone can immediately be made to declare his hand and put his gloss upon a damaging admission seems to have some minor validity. It seems, therefore, important to consider whether we wish to restrict the field of examination in the way that I suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that I am not taking a great deal of time to make my point initially. It is, in the context of the debate that we have had, fairly self-evident and the Committee will clearly wish to consider it. Here again, I have quite powerful support from some of the bodies that have taken an interest in the Bill. I have found in the past that the Government have not found that persuasive, but I keep trying, and I hope to have some success now. The Glasgow Bar Association is bitterly opposed to the clause. It says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, however, clause 6 is enacted, this Association submits that the following provisions should be added".</p></blockquote>
The first, leading all the rest, is that the right of the Crown to examine the accused should be restricted only to alleged extrajudicial confessions made in reply to a caution and charge. I believe that that is too extensive. My amendment seeks to take out reference to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"made in reply to a caution and charge."</p></blockquote>
The main burden of the association's position is reflected in my own, when it says that the concern should be only with extrajudicial confessions. For the benefit of those who have had the sad job of recording our deliberations through the night, that is on page 7 of the Glasgow Bar Association memorandum. As I have had to borrow a copy from my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) because my copy is with 	<i>Hansard,</i> I hope that that will guide them to the proper reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 10 of the memorandum of the Law Society of Scotland—this is the copy of the hon. Member for Dumbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), for the same reason—advances a similar argument in paragraph 7.4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Armstrong. We poor Back Benchers—literally on the back Bench—have been feeding the people in front of us with briefs all night and never getting them back. Where do they go? Can you explain that, Mr. Armstrong? My hon. Friend, the Member for Garscadden, is now reading a brief belonging to another of my hon. Friends. Three minutes ago I passed him my brief. While none of us actually requires briefs. I should like to know where they are. Perhaps we should send for the Serjeant at Arms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be some strange kind of paper-devouring insects—I do not know. However, I must not allow this unseemly bickering to distract me from the path of serious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is genuinely important. I was dealing with the Law Society memorandum, and paragraph 7 in particular:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council takes the view that the Clause might be less objectionable"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
that is a fair way of putting it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it were restricted to extra-judicial confessions, provided"—</p></blockquote>
I shall not weary the Committee with the further provisos made by the Law Society. The key phrase is that which I have quoted. That recommendation is the substance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has been at it for some time. It is now quite clear that we shall be at it for at least another eight or nine hours in this sitting, perhaps longer. Only time will tell, to make a rather obvious remark. I hope that we shall be able to make some progress. Some sign of concessions of substance from the Government would certainly oil the wheels of progress considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment—I make no bones about it—is substantial. However, it follows the recommendations of both the Bar Association and the Law Society. I should have thought that the Faculty of Advocates would also approve. That body is opposed to the clause, but does not go into sufficient detail for me to claim that it specifically endorses the amendment. However, I consider that it must be with the amendment in spirit. All those bodies are behind the suggestion in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of judicial examination would be limited to the area in which I believe that it would be most useful—if, indeed, such an exercise is ever useful. The amendment would also remove the most worrying aspect of the wide-ranging inquiry which some of us feel may be unleashed by the clause at the wrong stage in the judicial process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a splendid opportunity for the Solicitor-General to show that he can be genuinely helpful, that he has listened to the anxieties, and not just those of the narrow interest group represented, as always, by the other side of the Committee. There is always a tendency for Oppositions to oppose. I concede that that can on occasions warp judgment, although I trust that it has not done so on this occasion. The hon. and learned Gentleman has an opportunity to make a concession to legal opinion, to his colleagues and no doubt to many friends in the profession who have urged upon him that, as the Law Society says, the proposal in the amendment would be a way of making the clause more acceptable—or at least less obnoxious. In that spirit I commend the clear, simple, explicable amendment to the Committee. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
reserve the right to say a word or two later, when we have heard the Solicitor-General. I hope that the amendment will gain the support of my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are few amendments which, to echo the words of the Bar Association, I would more bitterly oppose. The purpose of judicial examination was set out in the Thomson report. I am satisfied that it can perform an extremely useful purpose. The innocent will have an early opportunity to state their position, which all the prisoners who gave evidence to the Thomson committee said that they wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the accused who have said that they wanted that opportunity. With great respect to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who says to his clients "No plea or declaration; shut up, and I'll see you later", I must point out that it was the prisoners who gave evidence to the Thomson committee who said that they wanted that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to page 43, paragraph 8.14, where it is set out with the greatest fairness. I ask members of the Committee to have regard to it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that there are three objects of judicial examination, namely:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>a.</i> to afford to an accused at the earliest possible stage in the judicial process an opportunity of stating his position as regards the charge against him. Absence of such an opportunity in the present system was the subject of complaint by all the prisoners interviewed by members of the Committee."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But surely the hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate that if that was a complaint by prisoners—I am surprised, but I accept that it must have, because it is recorded by Lord Thomson—it is based upon a complete misapprehension. Every one of them, under the present system, has the opportunity when appearing on the first lawful date to make any declaration. So to bring in all this in order to give them that opportunity is to perpetrate a fraud upon them. All that need be said to them is "You have that right. Exercise it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Fairburn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but as the hon. Gentleman has already told the Committee, he does not give them that right. He just says "No plea or declaration".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was their complaint. It was realistic.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
Judicial examination has three purposes as set forth in paragraph 8.14. One is to give an accused person an early opportunity of being asked his position and of stating his innocence. The second is to prevent the fabriaction of false defences which is a real and broad and dangerous part of our system of justice. If any hon. Member opposite can suggest any other way of preventing the fabrication of false defences I shall be happy to hear from him. This is a major step towards the prevention of the fabrication of false defences which I have no hestitation in saying is a widespread habit in many very serious cases. The third purpose is to protect the interests of the accused who has been interrogated by police officers or who has given answers to caution and charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reasons are set forth in Thomson, and to suggest, as the hon. Member for Garscadden did, that it was an innocent paring away of one part of it is quite improper. He had a field day challenging caution and charge and what had been said or blurted out in answer to it. It is the second part which is the parity to the first part. The purpose of judicial examination is simply to prevent the fabrication of false defences. When I hear hon. Members opposite say that they know that that happens regularly and that they are anxious that it should not, I shall be more convinced by their arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we know the purpose. Up to now it has been argued that the purpose was to protect the innocent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the hon. and learned Gentleman's final words. He said that the purpose was to prevent the fabrication of false witness. I can accept that it is both to protect the innocent and to expose the guilty, but he was clear in his final words that that was the main purpose. To call in aid paragraph 8.14 of the Thomson report, which I find extremely suspect in its reasoning seems to be almost the last thing that the Government should have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is reason why the lawyers of Scotland should be anxious about this proposal. Surely, the problem that we are facing is the injection of elements of the inquisitorial system into one element of what is basically an accusatorial system. This is the nub of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
problem. Had they gone the whole way and had the courage of their convictions—and by Jove, we have had plenty of passion from the Solicitor-General defending this proposal—the Government could have changed the entire judicial procedures. But the danger lies in introducing this as one element in the chain, before the full formal procedure. For that reason I believe that my hon. Friend's amendment is right. We should cut out the section under (	<i>a</i>) and leave it to the alleged making of an extrajudicial confession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am buttressed in accepting that, partly because of the support of the Bar Association and the Law Society of Scotland, but also because other matters are now raised. It is true that this begins to infringe the right of silence. Now we want to infringe the right of silence—subsection(1)(	<i>a</i>)(i), line 15 onwards—on
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether any account which the accused can give ostensibly discloses a category of defence".</p></blockquote>
As we have seen through many discussions in Committee, it is often the case that "poor category" and "line of defence" can be developed at a later stage. Not only developed, which is the point that continually bugs the Solicitor-General that they put it in at the last minute to let the guilty get off with a new-found alibi that he is playing golf with his aged grandmother, but that also a valid special defence can be adduced—legal, honest and truthful—at a later stage. It seems to me that the only way to cut that out is to pass the amendment and leave it to the extrajudicial confessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is more to it, however, than that. Another aspect is the relationship of the accused with his solicitor. The truth is that the accused's solicitor is not in a position to initiate with his client a line of questioning in those proceedings. He is not there as a defence but, in a slightly defensive role, to amplify and clarify a line of questioning that has come, and it is written in the Bill that it can only come, from the prosecution It is this imbalance that has led the Law Society of Scotland and others—I earlier questioned this myself—to ask whether this now begins to contravene the European Convention on Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), line 12 onwards, "matters averred in the charge", and so on—with the imbalance that it gives between prosecution and defence—seems to put Her Majesty's Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
right in the middle of this great triumph of agreement with our partners in Europe, and now they suddenly find themselves hauled in front of the European Convention on Human Rights, and no doubt the court, because of the procedures here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not happen in France, where they have a full inquisitorial system. It would not have happened with us before, when we had a full accusatorial system. It is results in the mixing up of the two concepts and the dragging into this section of more matters that should have been left either under a formal, impartial investigation—as in France—or to the full panoply of the accusatorial procedure in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument, suggesting that we may be stepping into dangerous ground internationally, is contained in the appendix to the Law Society memorandum, which makes the point very strongly. It is in page 36 of the Law Society papers, which were borrowed by another of my hon. Friends some hours ago and I hope are still in the possession of 	<i>Hansard.</i> It says: "Clause 20A"—and in this reference we are, of course, dealing with clause 20A of the earlier Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"makes no provision for the accused's solicitor to intervene on his behalf in the course of examination nor as at present framed does it indicate the extent to which the Sheriff can control the proceedings."</p></blockquote>
By the way, the extent to which the sheriff can begin to direct, control, or even to protect the accused in this regard has not been sufficiently examined—even within the amendments that we have had here. The Law Society of Scotland says that this appears to contravene article 6(1) of the Convention on Human Rights and it quotes cases in Austria, reporting that
	<br><blockquote><p>"an inherent element of 'fair trial' was the procedural equality of the accused with the prosecutor and that there had to be' equality of arms'".</p></blockquote>
There is clearly no equality of arms nor an element of fair trial when the procedural equality of the accused is not on all fours with that of the prosecutor. Nothing is happening here which allows the defence counsel or the accused to start investigating and knocking holes in the prosecutor's case. Nothing in here allows the defence to start initiating his own lines of explanation. He is there to answer the prosecution case. Surely if the case heard in Austria is right, it applies equally here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently in the Austrian court of
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
criminal appeal the public prosecutor had the right to be present, but the applicants had no right of representation. The case was held in camera and the complaint was that there was thus no right to a fair trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason it would seem to be manifestly clear that the mere attendance of a solicitor, without having the right to initiate or investigate, is not enough because one of the elements of the inquisitorial system is investigation. This procedure does not involve investigation; the prosecutor examines a defence or statement brought up by the accused, and only that. There is clearly an imbalance in the equality between the accused and the prosecutor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need to argue this in terms of the European Convention. It can be argued fairly and squarely in our own terms here. The more I talk the more I realise that we should get a Member of the European Parliament, if I can think of one, to have the matter examined by the European Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Winnie Ewing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is lucky. She is asleep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correspondent says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would respectfully suggest that the mere attendance of an accused's solicitor does not appear to satisfy the requirements"</p></blockquote>
because he will not have access to information
	<br><blockquote><p>"from any source other than the accused."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say that where the inquisitorial system applies in other cases, the agent for the accused—his counsel or his defence solicitor—would have the opportunity at the examination stage at least to consult the dossier against his client. But this procedure is to take place without such a dossier and involving his client in front of him. All that they will have to go on is an imperfectly-framed indictment—perhaps I should say a temporarily-framed indictment—and, secondly, the questions from the prosecution in relation to what he chooses to raise, and he may not choose to raise matters which would allow an understanding by the defence solicitor of the kind of dossier that is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It always seemed to be an element of our accusatorial system that the prosecutor was not there merely to gain a conviction but to deploy the evidence. My hon. Friend will straighten me out if I am wrong, but our prosecutors have occasionally been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
criticised because they have gone too hard for a prosecution. In other words, it is the role of the representatives of the Crown Office to deploy the case to show the evidence. But, while that will be true in a major court case, at this preliminary stage it will be limited to the questions in the possession and the interests only of the procurator fiscal and will not be disclosed to the solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is no balance of equality. Where there is none, it is dangerous to introduce paragraph (	<i>a</i>) relating to
	<br><blockquote><p>"matters averred in the charge"</p></blockquote>
and particularly
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether any account which the accused can give ostensibly discloses a category of defence (as for example alibi, incrimination, or the consent of an alleged victim)".</p></blockquote>
That is the subsection which must go because of the imbalance that I described. I do not like any of it. But if it has to remain it should remain only for the question of the alleged making of an extrajudicial confession by the accused, whether or not with admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that we had a stingy reply from the Solicitor-General on this matter. Clearly, he is now pushing himself into the role of the kind of prosecuter, whom I have already described, who runs his case too hard. As soon as he begins to see that the main objective is not necessarily the protection of the innocent, but is the prevention of the falsification of evidence, psychologically he is moving away from the presumption of innocence and on to the assumption of guilt and is similarly equipping the prosecutors who work under him. The conduct and practice of that, whatever may be held theoretically by the procurators fiscal and their officials, is that a presumption of guilt is creeping in, and that is thoroughly reprehensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that my hon. Friends have put down the amendment. I have great pleasure in supporting it. As Steele or, I think, Addison once said, there is nothing that gives a man more comfort than to know that what he believes in is supported by a man who is universally respected. He went on to say that the view of one of the tenants was discovered also to be the view of Sir Roger de Coverley. In the same way, as a simple, plain, naive layman on these matters, I am pleased to have the backing of the Faculty of Advocates, the Law Society, the Glasgow Bar Association, and my hon. Friend the Member for Qarscadden—the Roger de

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am supporting the amendment, because I look upon this clause—and this part of the clause—not just in relation to the clause as it stands on its own, but in relation to its part within the changes that are taking place in terms of police powers in part I of the Bill and other things that are happening, which seem to me to be shifting the whole emphasis about law in Scotland against the accused. That is to the detriment of the accused person whether he is innocent or guilty, because one must remember that until he is found guilty in a court of law he is innocent, he is only the accused, he is not a guilty person—although, from some of the explanations we have heard and in many of the comments made by the Solicitor-General, that principle seems to have been forgotten by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentlman made comments about people fabricating evidence, and so on. That seems to be making some judgment about their innocence or guilt and not simply saying that they are accused. We have heard references to the guilty. That may have been a slip of the tongue on the part of the Solicitor-General, but it seems to me that what is taking place in our system is a shift away from the rights of the accused person. Whether in terms of being stopped on the street, or detained, or searched for offensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
weapons, or in terms of the rights of the accused when he appears in court, it seems to me that the balance is shifting all the time away from the accused and towards the prosecution and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is what is happening I have to oppose it, because I think it is wrong. It is possible to take each of these clauses and give, as the Solicitor-General is trying to do, a logical and even semi-liberal explanation of it, but we must look at the Bill as a whole rather than at each single clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's view of this paragraph. It has always seemed to me that one of the basic principles of our legal system was that the accused person had the right to reserve his defence until he heard the full prosecution case. I may be wrong in thinking that that is a basic principle— if so, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden will put me right— but I have always thought that one of the basic liberties of an accused person was that he could reserve his defence until he knew in full what he was being accused of, and what case the prosecution had against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this provision that my hon. Friend is trying to take out of the Bill, the person may have some idea of what he is being charged with but may find out when he gets to court, having gone through the procedure, that the indictment is slightly different. Am I right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is possible. In other words, the time at which the offence is said to have taken place may be different on the indictment that finally appears in court from that which was stated at the stage we are discussing now. If, therefore, the accused puts a case forward on alibi and produces an alibi for the time when the offence took place, he may find when he gets to court that his defence is meaningless because the time when the offence took place appears to have changed during the time between this procedure and the final court appearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prosecution is to be given an opportunity to ask the accused to give his defence against that charge, without the accused knowing exactly what the full case against him is. If he will not answer, the simple fact of his refusing to answer will
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
count against him when he goes into court. That seems to me to be wrong. It puts the accused into a much weaker position. We are talking about people who may be innocent. The Solicitor-General has tried to say that he is protecting the innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the case of someone who is accused. He may be a known criminal; that is one of the problems in our system. In some ways, that proves my point. Let us take the case of someone who is a known criminal and who is accused of an offence that took place three or four years ago. He is innocent of that charge, although he may have been guilty of other offences. It is not a question whether a person is guilty of offences in general, but whether he is guilty of the particular offence of which he is charged. He may be asked three or four years later where he was at the time that the offence was committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that if someone asked me where I was on the afternoon of 4 June 1976, I should be pushed, without a diary or other record, to tell him. I might be able to say that I was at work at the time, but I could not remember whether it was one afternoon on which I happened not to be at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accused person could be placed in a false position. He would rightly have to say in those circumstances "I am sorry, I am not answering because I don't know where I was." That would count against him. If, when he came to trial he produced a valid alibi for that time because he had had a chance to check it, perhaps with his employers, his work sheets or other evidence he might have, the prosecution would ask him why he did not say that at the time. That would count against him. That shifts the balance away from the accused persons' rights towards the prosecution's rights, which in many ways are already well weighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there is fabrication of evidence. In all cases, throughout the judicial system, the whole principle of Biritish justice has been based on the idea that it is better that a few guilty people get off than that one innocent person is found guilty. That is at the root of Biritish justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is fabrication, I accept that. I do not like or want it. But if innocent people are to have more problems in the courts because of this procedure, I think it better that a few guilty people get away with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could probe the Solicitor-General's mind about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
way that he sees this power working. I was concerned about his approach when answering the original points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). We are dealing with a problem that concerns not necessarily the first examination of the accused. The clause is specific. It states that either at the first or subsequent examination the accused could be asked these questions in order to establish a line of defence and to give the prosecutor the opportunity to know at a very early stage what line of defence the accused's counsel is likely to pursue when the case comes to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the accused, either at the first or subsequent examination were merely to say "I did not commit that offence", would that be the end of the matter until the case came to court and would it then be for the court to test whether the accused committed the offence.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that I ask that question is very important. It is laid down in the clause that the questions must not be designed to challenge the truth of anything that the accused person says at the examination. If I take the example of an accused person merely saying at the examination "I did not commit the offence", I am assuming, I hope correctly, that that would be the end of the examination and that the matter would then be decided by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if the accused person says "I did not commit the offence because I was in the company of Jimmy Smith at the pictures", I take it that there can be no question of that story being checked out and subsequently the accused person being brought back for further examination and having questions put to him. That would contravene the clause by challenging the truth of what the accused person had said at the judicial examination, however, if the accused person did not say that he had a defence of alibi and that he was with Jimmy Smith at the pictures when the offence was committed, but he subsequently said to when he came to trial, I suspect that the Solicitor-General, in the role of prosecutor, would say "Why didn't you say that when you were judicially examined?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there not a great danger of bringing the clause into disrepute? Is there not a great danger, particularly in the case of the habitual offender who will quickly get wise to all these procedures, that such an accused person will merely say at his judicial examination, whether the initial examination or any subsequent one, that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
did not commit the offence full stop, and that he will not go any further in the judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, when he comes to trial, he says "I did not commit the offence because" and then goes on to develop why he did not commit the offence, I should have thought that was a fair approach for an accused person, and particularly his defence counsel, to take. It is fair to assume that the accused person at this stage of judicial examination will have had some contact with and advice from his or her legal adviser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the proposals are introduced I think that that is what will happen. I am not in favour of anyone being able to fabricate evidence or set up a defence that is purely dishonest. No member of the Committee is in favour of that, but neither are we in favour of enacting legislation that is riddled with loopholes on the one hand and can easily be brought into disrepute on the other. That is why I am anxious to probe further the thinking of the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I suspect, the Solicitor-General intends to tell me that an accused person at either the initial or the subsequent examination says "I didn't commit the offence" full stop, that is the finish, because according to the clause no questions may be put to challenge the truth of that statement and it becomes a matter for the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of good legal practice it would seem to be a practical proposition to adopt the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden and myself to take the provision out of the Bill. That would be the sensible approach. Our proposal is being made for the best of all possible reasons. The Solicitor-General may not see it that way, but we have argued our case on that basis and I am anxious to hear the Solicitor-General's answer to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, briefly, I consider that the amendment has been put down for the worst of all possible reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>1.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the worst characteristics of our system of criminal justice is that people are frequently acquitted by putting forward utterly false defences which they have had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
the opportunity of fabricating as a result of hearing the evidence first and and as a result of the subsequent delay. The answer to the specific questions that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked me is that if the accused says "I deny the offence", that is not the end of the examination, because the prosecutor may say "Well, were you in Sauchiehall Street at that time? Did you see the fight? Were you involved in it? Were you with X or Y?" Those are open questions, so the mere fact that he says "I deny the offence" does not end the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may take a situation where a man is charged with murdering his father, and he just says "I deny the offence." At his trial he is defended by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), instructed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). He says "I was just making chips, and my father was drunk and ran on to the knife."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a person says "I deny the offence" the day after it is committed, and three months' later he has an explanation of how he denied the offence, it is proper to comment that it is natural to give an explanation at the time when one is asked for it—not, as in the police station caution and charge, when one is advised that one need say nothing, as though it were better to say nothing. One is being asked "What is your explanation?" It is a perfectly open question in controlled situations. But, as the hon. Member for Garscadden will know, most alibis are bogus. Anyone who puts forward an alibi is running a considerable risk, for anyone who can remember where he was on 31 March at 3 o'clock in the afternoon is a genius. I doubt whether the hon. Member for Garscadden could remember what he was doing yesterday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon if I asked him, far less three months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, therefore, if one takes alibi or any other special defence, within hours of being charged one is infinitely more likely to be able to give an accurate account of a truthful alibi, but one will not be able to have sent out one's chums who have brought visiting cards to Barlinnie, saying "Go and see old Norm, old Stan and old Bogie and tell them we were all together at the races that day." Eventually those are the names that are given to the solicitor, and the false defence is put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the twin aims of the clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
—to enable the innocent immediately to give their explanations, and to prevent the guilty in the long-term from concocting false explanations—are creditable aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General has not greatly helped the atmosphere by the way in which he has received the amendment. It was not tabled for unworthy reasons. It has broad support from the legal profession, which might have ensured it even a grudging admission of respectability in the eyes of the Solicitor-General, even if he disagreed with it. I am sorry that he has treated it in such a scurvey fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are signs on his part of a tendency to overstate his case, which he should try to curb. Such things have happened before in this Committee. The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), for example, said that the police were demonstrably losing the battle against crime. Statements of that kind are unfortunate. I put in the same category suggestions that most alibis are bogus and that many people are acquitted as a result of bogus alibis. I think, it fair to say that one comes across bogus alibis, for the reasons that I gave earlier—that people will cast around for any support in a storm —but my own experience, for what it is worth, is that alibis seldom succeed, and that bogus alibis do not succeed at all. To suggest, as was implied by the Solicitor-General, that the success of the bogus alibi has resulted in many people, who were as guilty as sin, walking the streets of Scotland, is irresponsible and unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a worry about the bogus alibi it is that it perhaps delays and prolongs trials unnecessairly. I deplore that. I dislike any bogus alibi and if there is any way in which I can prevent bogus alibis by telling my client that I believe he is wasting everyone's time, then that will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in a small number of cases from the new machinery there will be a contribution to the exploding of a bogus alibi. I concede that. But against that we have to balance the considerable encroachment on an important freedom for the individual which is provided by the right of silence. When one is weighed against the other I have no doubt that the balance of the argument is against the new provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to a couple of points made by the Solicitor-General because they were the burden of his argument against the amendment which he treats with such contempt. He referred to paragraph 8.14
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
of the Thomson report and the fact that there appear to have been some representations from prisoners to the effect that an early opportunity of stating their case was denied them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made some remarks which have been slightly misinterpreted. I am sure that that was done unintentionally. I said that the pressures of the present system and the long custom and habit has now come down in favour of an assumption that a judicial declaration is not in the interest of one's client. I said that there was a tendency on the part of clients, who may not know of their rights, and certainly of solicitors, to fall in with that assumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Solicitor-General is right in saying that the judicial declaration, as presently allowed by law, ought to be revived. I should have thought that that would apply in only a small minority of special cases, but I take his point. However, I was stressing that it was dishonest to suggest that in order to revive that right there has to be judicial examination. What we could have said to the prisoners who were making representations to Lord Thomson would have been "You do not need judicial examination"—there may be a case for that, but it is a totally different case—"because, if you want to make an early declaration, you can do it on the first lawful day through your solicitor or despite him if necessary".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would hardly arise, however, so it is a totally false argument to suggest that the exercise of that right depends upon this clause. Similarly, so is the whole point about the fabrication of false defences. I find this a thoroughly unconvincing explanation as to why we need this particular extension of judicial examination beyond extra-judicial confession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General said that most alibis were bogus. He gave an interesting reason for that—namely, that no one can be expected to remember what he was doing on a certain day. That is exactly the kernel of our case. Of course he cannot. There he is. He has been picked up. I know that occasionally the Solicitor-General goes into the real world. He will know that the pick-up is often at 2 o'clock in the morning. The man is taken from his bed. He is taken to the cells. He is pushed into the sheriff court. A petition is produced at the very last minute and he finds himself before the sheriff in chambers being judicially examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General is quite right. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
could not agree with him more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rifkinned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, when one has been rifkinned, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, it is extremely difficult to remember where one was at a time that may be extremely ill-defined and which one has not had time to consider at any leisure. Therefore, I agree that it is extremely difficult to produce an alibi under the pressure and confusion of a judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, later, one may quite genuinely, not in any bogus or false way, with the aid of one's family or friends and with the knowledge of the exact timing of the alleged offence, be able to construct an alibi that will hold water. Of course, that whole operation may be undermined and imperilled because of the extension of judicial examination into this area of inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a case for judicial examination, it is in testing the extra-judicial confession. There one starts with a limited area of inquiry. One has a specific allegation that certain words were said and what one is saying to the accused person is a totally understandable concept: "Did you say this?" The second simple question is "If you did say it, have you any explanation or gloss you would like to put on it, anything you would like to add or subtract, or any explanation you would like to offer which would put these words into a context which you will wish to produce to a jury at a subsequent trial?" There is a concrete, limited inquiry, based on a confession or alleged confession, which, I am glad to say, under the Bill will have to be laid before the judicial examination before the accused party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can just about live with that. I do not like it, but I think that one could possibly live with it, and I can understand it. But the idea that we are now trying to exclude is totally different. Here we have what may be a wide-ranging inquiry— "Were you in Sauchiehall Street? If you were, did you kick him! If you did not kick him, did anyone else kick him?" and so on. I do not know how it can be limited. After all, it is the fiscal who will decide. There are some attempts at safeguards in the Bill to limit the line of questioning, but sheriffs are only human, and sheriffs who have to arbitrate will take very differing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
views on what should and should not be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this will not be resented or seen as paranoia, but I and everyone who is active in the law in west central Scotland can think of sheriffs who are likely to see the provision as an opportunity of rooting about in the possible area which the defence may take in an attempt to undermine the case. It is the natural instinct of a small number of sheriffs. They will be hostile and will allow a wide-ranging cross-examination, which I do not believe is in the interests of justice. It could not be controlled; it is not limited merely to questions about something that we already have—an extra-judicial or alleged extrajudicial confession. It might become very much like a sceptical cross-examination: "So you say have you a defence, but what about …? What about …? What about …? That is thoroughly dangerous.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 6, line 28, after "has", insert "at least 12 hours".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is anything mysterious about the amendment. It is merely an attempt to strengthen the safeguard which the Government have properly seen fit to include in their proposals. We all accept that if judicial examination is to be anything less than a farce when it is inquiring into an alleged confession, the text of that alleged confession must be in the hands of the accused being examined and his solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause presently states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may only be put if the accused has, before the examination".</p></blockquote>
I want to strengthen that by adding "at least 12 hours". That may sound restrictive and as though it may make life difficult for
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
where I believe judicial examination would be most useful and it removes the area of maximum anxiety. If the Solicitor-General had looked at it a little more sympathetically and a little more flexibly, he would have done more credit to his office and to his party's sense of justice and fair play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, but in the way in which this matter has been treated I see a little bit of a declaration of war. I should have liked to have seen some movement from the Government, even if it had been a mere nod in the direction of recognising the difficulties to which we refer. We have not had it. We have no recourse but to divide the Committee, although we accept that, unless one or two hon. Gentlemen have gone to sleep somewhere, we shall probably be unsuccessful in the vote. But we must divide the Committee as a protest and as positive support for what I believe is a constructive and useful amendment which, unfortunately, has not found favour with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>the authorities, but I do not believe that that is necessarily so. I am anxious to guard against the kind of situation which I described as already existing in terms of the availability of petitions, for example, the point at which the accused makes on indictment his first appearance.</p>
	<p>My view is that the present situation is totally indefensible except in terms of the first appearance being purely formal, apart from the bail application. At the moment, we seldom get a judicial declaration. The only thing that is contentious is whether the accused should be released on bail or held in custody with the 110-day rule running. Given that, it does not matter too much in practical terms that he often sees his petition literally only 10 or 15 minutes prior to 'his going before the sheriff. But that would be totally unsupportable if it were more than a formal session—if there were to be a judicial declarat on or proceedings of real weight which would affect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
the outcome of the trial—and there were no opportunity for the accused to consult his solicitor and put the whole matter in perspective.</p>
	<p>By introducing judicial examination, we are creating exactly the same situation in which there will be proceedings of real importance. This is not a formality. It is to be taken seriously by the prosecution. The Solicitor-General would certainly agree with that. It may radically affect the trial if it is to bolster a special defence or undermine a special defence by allowing adverse comment at the trial.</p>
	<p>This is the stuff of battle. It is where we shall win or lose the trial at the end of the day. In those circumstances we must not allow the text of the confession to be introduced only at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute. Unless we beef up the clause with the provision contained in the amendment, that is what might occur. The clause provides only that the confession must be in the hands of the accused before the examination. It might equally well apply to the confession being in the hands of the accused before he makes his first appearance. He is given it but just in the nick of time, thus precluding it being of any real use. I am anxious to avoid that in the interests of the judicial examination system.</p>
	<p>If we are to introduce such a radical departure in our criminal procedure, it is very important that the system is given credibility by allowing the conditions for it to operate properly. It is very much in that spirit that I suggest 12 hours. I am not hard and fast for 12 hours; if the hon. and learned Gentleman said that "at least 12 hours" was unreasonable, but that he was prepared to compromise on five or six hours, I would not quarrel too much about that. It would not be so good, but it would secure a reasonable period for examination and consultation with one's solicitor.</p>
	<p>Without that spacing—without that time for thought, for setting the scene and explaining to a man his rights—we may create a dangerous situation that will undermine all confidence in the usefulness of judicial examination.</p>
	<p>I said, Mr. Armstrong, that I would sit down in five or six minutes, and that time has now passed. I hope I have made my argument clear. I hope that I shall get some support from my hon. Friends and from Conservative Members.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel quite strongly
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
about this matter. I have read the amendment very carefully, and the provision in the Bill, and I think it is important that we should strengthen the right of the accused to receive from the prosecutor or the police:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a written record of the confession allegedly made."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. We have heard time and again during our proceedings how busy lawyers are. I have employed as my family lawyer the finest legal mind serving on the Committee. He is so busy that he has yet to produce my will, which I asked him to draft about five years ago. The advancing years are worrying me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious point. Lawyers are busy people. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made a point about the late stage at which lawyers sometimes receive the petitions. I think the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) made the same point earlier. I am very worried indeed about the length of time that lawyers have in which to prepare a case, or partially prepare the case by considering the statement made by the accused person. I am, therefore, firmly convinced that this 12 hours provision is only fair to the accused and to his lawyer. I think it would also greatly help the court if the lawyer had had the opportunity to discuss the statement with the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a job in which I had to represent people. I always took a great deal of time to prepare my case, and there always was time to prepare. I am aghast to discover that case preparation could be put in such a difficulty because the lawyer receives the petition only 10 minutes before an appearance before the sheriff. I hope that when the Solicitor-General replies he will deal with this. I am quite sure that many people in Scotland will be concerned to learn this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a laymen in legal matters I am learning as we proceed through the Bill, and I am far from happy about some of the things I am learning. I am sure that many people who recognise that a day might come when they could find themselves on a charge will be concerned to hear that lawyers will see their petitions only 10 minutes before appearing before the sheriff. I am anxious that we should hear something about this. I am quite sure that the amendment would improve the quality of the proceedings in the court and the quality of the case made for the accused. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
sure that that is important and that it is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said I would be brief, Mr. Armstrong. I have spoken very quickly and been as briefaslcan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have obviously reached the sort of amendment where the note in front of the Minister says "resist, but if pressed be willing to reconsider". I hope that with those few words we shall now hear the Solicitor-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not read those words. I understand the purpose behind the amendment of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), which, is that, if at 10 o'clock at night the accused receives his copy of his answer to caution and charge or his statement to the police, of course there will be 10 hours before the 10 o'clock convening of the court for him and his solicitor to spend the night considering the matter. That seems to be a slightly different picture of events from the fact that a solicitor who has apparently taken on far more cases than he can conveniently deal with rushes into the sheriff court for 10 o'clock in the morning, two minutes beforehand, to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that an accused person is bound to know whether he said what it is alleged he said. If it was a lengthy document that he had to check, for example, and he or his solicitor said to the court "I have not had an opportunity to consider this document", the court would obviously grant him an adjournment as a matter of fairness. The court has the power to do that and power to give an adjournment for half an hour, one hour, 10 hours or 10 days. But the effect of the amendment, were it to be accepted in this rigid form, would be that it would always mean that unless the document arrived 12 hours before the court convened on the next lawful day the person would be in custody for another 24 hours in order to fulfil this requirement. That would be the inevitable effect.

Therefore, if the hon. Member wishes to put corrupt motives to the police, one way to keep the chap in for an extra day would be to make sure that he did not get a copy of the document until after 10 o'clock the night before his appearance at 10 o'clock the next morning. That would automatically mean that the judicial examination
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
would have to be adjourned for a day, and having been adjourned for a day it would automatically mean that the man would be in custody for another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe these are very serious considerations which must be understood. I much prefer a situation with which a sheriff can deal if an accused person's solicitor says "I have only just been handed this document of six pages and I have not asked my client whether he said this, whether there are any 'nots' missing or what explanation he has." That is much more satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that if the Solicitor-General thought that the 12 hours was wrong but was prepared to suggest something else, he was prepared to compromise. We would be grateful if the Solicitor-General could perhaps see that on occasions we are offering compromises and trying to see ways in which we can assist. But we keep encountering this blank wall of opposition to everything we propose. If the Solicitor-General believes that 12 hours is too long, let him give us some length of time which would take account of the problems he raised. If we had given a time of six hours it would be unlikely that there would be a whole day's delay as a result, and if that is reasonable why does he not say so and let us proceed to the next part of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) very simply. There is absolute flexibility in any adjournment sought by application to the sheriff if a person was to receive a copy of what he was alleged to have said too late for it to be properly considered by himself or his solicitor. I consider that to have a flexible system which could provide for more than 12 hours or less than 12 minutes is much more sensible. That is the common law as it stands, and I believe that there is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement at present whereby a sheriff may grant an adjournment in the interests of fairness to the accused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister is being less than fair to the House of Commons and to the Committee. The proposition is to try to write into the Bill that the flexibility which the hon. and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
learned Gentleman seeks and which he claims would always be exercised in the interest of the accused will be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is an alternative. For example, flexibility could be introduced by using the phrase "Unless the accused or his solicitor is willing to waive such a time limit." Such flexibility would be sought by the accused. It is always apparently in defence of the accused that the hon. and learned Gentleman puts forward his troglodyte arguments, but it is of no help to the accused if he has needed that time and the sheriff says "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However if the hon. and learned Gentleman is telling us that the proposal is in the accused's interest, let there be a time limit —a ceiling—written in and at the same time let us give flexibility on the say-so of the accused or his solicitor. In other words, they may choose not to exercise their option of having that time. There is no difficulty. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to turn over the page of his brief; I am quite sure he will find that, if he is pressed, it is recommended that he should agree to consider what has been said. That must be so; no civil servant could be so lunatic as the Solicitor-General has been. Such concessional advice must have been given to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a course would be eminently sensible. Many sheriffs will not exercise that flexibility. The matter is becoming a sort of Russian roulette. If someone appears before Sheriff Smith he will be okay, but in front of Sheriff Jones he is bound to sweat. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] The reaction to my remarks underlines the fact that that position is known about, envisaged and understood by the hon. and learned Gentlemen. Yet despite the Solicitor-General's response to two names picked out of the air at random—he recognises the differences that could occur—he is still content to leave the flexibility to one or other of those two sheriffs, although I do not know which of them is the baddie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the hon. and learned Gentleman understands that. He has made out our case for us. If it is recognised that there will be a difference of treatment, not in relation to the accused or the nature of the offence but only because of the sheriff, it is necessary for a time safeguard to be written in. The Government and their civil servants have made out our case. If the Solicitor-General wants flexibility, let him write in something that would be at the say-so of the accused, who may feel "I
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
know that I have 12, 10 or eight hours, but I am willing to waive that and to meet straight away." That is the way out of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time is now 2.20 and not once have we had anything but troglodyte opposition from the hon. and learned Gentleman. He was in opposition for too long; it is time he realised that he is now a member of the Government. The flippant levity with which he treats serious issues and the attitude of opposition that he adopted in his opening words are not good enough. We are dealing with the law of Scotland and he is the Law Officer who is here to defend that law. For goodness' sake, will the Solicitor-General try to mature in the few remaining hours of this sitting and give us a sensible answer? He provided us with an argument in his response to my reference to Sheriffs Smith and Jones, and we are relying on him to do his duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that Smith and Jones may turn out to be no alias. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) made a sound and skilful point—possibly accidental or haphazardly—during his remarks. We have been making cracking pace in this sitting of the Committee and have nearly got through three clauses. I certainly do not want to obstruct progress. Unfortunately, although we are proceeding in the sense of getting through what is printed, we are making very little progress in educating the Solicitor-General. I am almost beginning to hope that he will take a back seat, that the Under-Secretary will come forward, and that we shall then have better luck—who knows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that this is the kind of situation in most Committees when the cry would go out "Send for the Solicitor-General" to get us out of the mess? We are in the fortunate position that he is here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Normally the Solicitor-General, who is traditionally careful of the onerous responsibilities of his office, would be expected to be particularly careful about the rights of the individual and the protection allowed by the criminal law system to someone who is under suspicion or accusation. We would expect him to be a little too cautious or nice in his regard for the principles of the law. That fault, if it

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 7, line 5, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the permission of the sheriff".</p></blockquote>
The reason for this amendment is that my hon. Friends and I take the view that a civil liberty is at stake and that there is a loss of ground in civil rights. We have said that throughout the course of the Bill and it is just one of the many things that we are repeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of regret that we are so obviously failing to persuade any Government Members to side with us, but we are hopeful, certainly I am hopeful, that on this occasion the Solicitor-General and his colleagues will feel able to agree to our proposal. The matter at stake is the right of the accused person to be fully represented, because the representation that is envisaged in the clause is:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>go, having made our point. But given the atmosphere that has been engendered, and the reply we have been given, I will divide the Committee and hope that some of my hon. Friends will feel able to vote with me.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>alleged extra-judicial confession or the matter averred in any charge."—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"With the permission of the sheriff, the solicitor for the accused may ask the accused any question the purpose of which is to clarify any ambiguity in an answer given by the accused to the prosecutor at the examination or to give the accused an opportunity to answer any question which he has previously refused to answer."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>It is a little odd that that can only be done with the permission of the sheriff. It raises the question: why is the permission of the sheriff required? If the accused is being represented by his legal representative it should be possible to do this without the permission of the sheriff. Why there is a restriction on the accused's solicitor, I do not know. I hope that when the Solicitor-General replies to what will probably be a brief debate, he will take the opportunity to enlighten us as to why the Government believe that there ought to be a restriction on the accused's solicitor. What circumstances justify the shift in the balance of justice—if I can put it so highly —in favour of the prosecutor? I am at a loss about that question, too, because it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
can always be said of our court system in this country that there is anxiety on the part of everyone associated with the procedures of the court to ensure fairness. But this subsection does not contain fairness, because it places restrictions on the accused's solicitor. Surely this demonstrate the loss of freedom and the loss of civil rights which are so prevalent in the Bill. I receive a heavy mail on the Bill, and I anticipate that the same letters are arriving on the desks of Government Ministers. In these letters the point that is being repeated time and again is that the Bill reduces civil rights, and the whole question of the accused's rights.</p>
	<p>I hope that we shall now receive some answers to some of the questions that I have posed. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will take up these points and pursue them further. Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden can rely on his court experience, and will be able to explain to us just—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has shown magnificent restraint throughout the proceedings on the Bill. I had thought that his behaviour would remain consistent and that he would not say too much, but if he wants to contribute on this point I am sure that we shall benefit from what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to hear from the Government exactly why the permission of the sheriff is required and why that restriction is being placed on the accused's solicitor. It does not seem fair. It shifts the balance towards the prosecutor in a way that is unfair. I hope that on this occasion Government Ministers will feel able to join us in supporting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have immense pleasure in following my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) who moved the amendment. He made an irrefutable case which convinced me completely. He referred to a wrong balance. He is right about that, and I wish to examine the situation further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally one expects the bench to safe-
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
guard the rights of the accused. That is a recognition that it is not the procurator fiscal who is on trial and who may be punished. The right balance is maintained by the bench ensuring that everything possible is done for the accused, so that his point of view may be heard. Such a balance must be assumed in any investigation. Not only has that balance been destroyed, but the Government have inverted the accepted procedures of our criminal justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The revised section 20(A)(2) lays a duty on the sheriff in relation to the procurator fiscal. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sheriff shall ensure that all questions are fairly put to, and understood by, the accused."</p></blockquote>
There is no suggestion that he may interfere with the actual questions, nothing to say that the prosecution can only pursue certain questions with the persmision of the sheriff. The sheriff's only duty is to ensure that all the questions are fairly put to and understood by the accused. That is the position of the sheriff in relation to the procurator fiscal. Yet the position of the sheriff in relation to accused is that the defence counsel can put questions only with the permission of the sheriff. Not only is the balance distorted, it is inverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that quite monstrous. However, it is in line with the rest of the Solicitor-General's thinking. All his answers betray his assumption that the accused is guilty. That feeling came through clearly to the Opposition. We have to judge that attitude, and our judgment is that the Bill gives the safeguards to the accuser instead of to the accused. That reverses what has been the basis of our justice and our law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that this was a matter of civil liberties. Taking individual cases, that is right, but in terms of the general legal position the measure is a grievous step backwards. Such behaviour and attitudes remind me of Lord Braxfield: "Come on and hang one of these villains; none of them will be the wor nor hanging."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should stick to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, Mr. Armstrong. But Braxfield was not even his real name. His name was McQueen—imagine that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have made my point. Not only civil liberties are involved. We go further. The balance between the accused and the accuser is now totally wrong.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
Everything should be done in the interests of the accused so that his case is known. Every possible advantage should be given to him not necessarily to get off, but so that he can make his case. That is now being inverted; the balance is being perverted; the role of the defence solicitor is being inhibited. No such inhibition is laid on the role of the procurator fiscal, except that all his questions must be fairly posed—the questions themselves do not require permission. That cannot be tolerated. An absolutely new principle is being injected into our legal system. I am glad that my hon. Friend brought that point forward; I had not spotted the seriousness of the situation until then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition is monstrous. It cannot be accepted. Surely on this occasion the Solicitor-General will be able for once to shake off the Braxfield aura that he has been adopting all evening and give us some justice. The proposition also seems to me to infringe the balance which was brought in by the European Convention on Human Rights. Were it not so late, I should try to contact my favourite Member of the European Parliament to see if something could be done. The Government had better watch it. They are putting their heads in a noose with Europe. Scottish justice will be branded all over the world. It lies in the hands of the hon. Member who is responsible for Scottish law in this House. Send for the Lord Advocate, say I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members opposite read the clause they would see that the sheriff is in control of what questions are asked by both the prosecutor and the defence. In subsection (2) one will see that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the questions should not be designed"—</p></blockquote>
by the prosecutor—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to challenge the truth of anything said by the accused;</p></blockquote>
The sheriff is in control of what questions may be asked at a judicial examination. It goes on to say:—
	<ol>
	<li>there should be no reiteration of a question which the accused has refused to answer at the examination; and</li>
	<li>there should be no leading questions; and the sheriff shall ensure that all questions are fairly put to, and understood by, the accused."</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"The accused, where he is represented by a solicitor … shall be told by the sheriff that he may consult that solicitor before answering any questions."</li></div> <!-- ul --></ol>
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
That is not a safeguard which is built into the defence situation.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) With the permission of the sheriff, the solicitor for the accused may ask the accused any question the purpose of which is to clarify any ambiguity in an answer given by the accused to the prosecutor at the examination or to give the accused an opportunity to answer any question which he has previously refused to answer."</p></blockquote>
Both sides are under the control of the sheriff. Both have extremely limited objectives, and the hon. Member will remember that it was recommended in Thomson that the only questions which a solicitor should be allowed to ask should be asked through the sheriff and not by the solicitor himself. Accordingly the Government, having made that amendment as a result of representations in another place, have gone further than Thomson, and I believe that the matter is entirely fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not terribly impressed with the Solicitor-General's argument. It seems that the basic imbalance to which my friends have referred does exist. In subsection (2) the prosecutor has not quite an unfettered right but a right to ask questions at his discretion which are limited only in a specific fashion. That is, he is limited in the sense that he cannot ask questions designed to challenge the truth of anything said by the accused. There should be no reiteration of a question, and there should be no leading questions. But if he avoids those three specific sins, it seems to me that the prosecutor can ask any question that he wishes to ask, and the sheriff will be hard put to it to rule him out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (4), when it comes to the defence solicitor's turn, it is not a question of his being able to ask anything he wants subject to the fact that it must be for the purpose of clarifying an ambiguity or giving the accused the opportunity to answer a question which he has previously refused to answer. There is an overriding limitation on his field of action. He cannot ask any question, however proper, unless with the permission of the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have equality on the scale of comparison which the Solicitor-General was using, I should have thought the prosecutor would be limited by the caveats to which I have referred. The defence solicitor would be limited in a similar manner only by the conditions about clarifying ambiguity and giving the accused an opportunity to answer any question which he had previously refused to answer.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
That would be logical. I suppose that someone really perverse might want to insert "with the permission of the sheriff" as an overall limitation on the prosecutor as well, but I think that that would be a futile way of righting the balance. Our simple suggestion is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the permission of the sheriff"</p></blockquote>
should be taken out of clause 4. I think that we should then have something like equality of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a pettifogging point. There is a feeling generally in legal circles particularly among those engaged in defence work that the judicial examination is very one-sided, a leonine bargain. Those hon. Members who are worried would be somewhat reassured if at least the defence solicitor had the right to intervene to clear up an ambiguity when he thought that one existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ambiguity is not precise, nor can it be denned exactly in one man's mind. It may be that the sheriff thinks that he understood what was being said or that the defence solicitor thinks that there is ambiguity. It may be that at the end of the day a jury which has to make head and tail of the situation may agree with the defence solicitor. If the jury does agree, it would have found it extremely helpful if that ambiguity could have been cleared up by questions to that end from the defence solicitor.

	<br><blockquote><p>"who shall not be placed on oath".</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and to some extent—I say this rather tentatively and subject to what some of my hon. Friends may want to say—I think that it has been rather overtaken by events. It was designed to discover whether the accused was to be placed on oath during</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
	<p>ceedings or basically upset the grand design and the new strategy as outlined by the Government. But it would ensure that if, in the mind of one very important observer, the defence solicitor, the position had not been properly clarified, he would have an unfettered right to come in to clarify it. It would not be a right to go off on a trip of his own or to investigate all sorts of things which lead to new matters or to ask questions not previously raised, but merely to clarify an ambiguity or to answer a question which perhaps his client had unwisely refused to answer previously.</p>
	<p>It seems perfectly sensible to take out-with the permission the sheriff and take off the sheriff the burden of taking a decision as to whether there is ambiguity. That is not undermining the sheriff's role. The Solicitor-General has hastened to assure the Committee on more than one occasion that the sheriff is the arbiter in the proceedings and nothing more. We should certainly leave him with his arbitration powers and we should leave the rules on which he is to arbitrate that bit neater and tidier by putting the position of defence and prosecution on all fours.</p>
	<p>This is the most harmless of amendments. I hope that the Solicitor-General will think kindly of it, even at this late stage.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>the course of a judicial examination. The Committee will remember that the point was raised by the Law Society of Scotland in paragraph 7.8 of its memorandum when it pointed out the incontrovertible truth that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Clause is silent on whether the accused at a judicial examination is to be sworn."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>We know from what the Solicitor-General said in response to queries I made out of synch that it is the Government's intention that the accused should be sworn.</p>
	<p>We have a clear indication that the Solicitor-General is opposed to the amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
ment and feels that the accused should be put on oath. I do not intend to labour the point; I have a fairly open mind on the matter.</p>
	<p>12.45 am</p>
	<p>I am not entirely convinced by what the Solicitor-General said. As I understood his argument—I am casting back in my memory over a number of hours—he said that it was important that the accused should be on oath at judicial examination in exactly the same way as he would be on oath at his trial. Therefore, if he controverted what he said at judicial examination at his trial—I was about to be disembowelled by the advocate-depute—he should not have a bolthole by saying "I am telling the truth now. I was not telling the truth then because I was not on oath."</p>
	<p>I am not entirely convinced by that argument, but I do not want to prolong the matter and I do not want to divide the Committee on it. There are arguments both ways. However, it does underline the importance of what happens at judicial examination. The fact that it is being elevated—if I may put it that way—to the level of evidence on oath, so that there can be no escaping the consequences of what is said at judicial examination, underlines, underscores, stresses and puts in headlines all the points we have been making about the need for safeguards and ensuring that the machinery is properly honed to the needs of the accused person.</p>
	<p>I am particularly distressed that we have had so little success with the Solicitor-General. To employ the phrase of the evening, we are in a Braxfield phase where everything will be dinged doon and not a concession will be made, however well our case is argued, however, reasonable and broadly supported. That particularly miserable and partisan attitude would have been a little better and easier to accept if it was not clear from the fact that the accused is to be put on oath the importance the Government attach to what happens in that little room, where the strange little interrogation will take place in a somewhat hole in the corner manner—given the way, in the real world, I fear it will be sprung upon the accused and the defence solicitor.</p>
	<p>However, we must live with our disappointments and despite these it would not be fair to press the matter to a vote. I should prefer to seek leave to withdraw the

In the Thomson committee's recommendations there is a series of forms of oath, and proposals on how they might be used and to whom they may be addressed.

Some very interesting evidence was submitted by the churches. It seems that the Church of Scotland supports the inclusion of the words "at the great day of judgment". I have no comment to makeab out that but I believe that it is worth putting on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely appropriate that my hon. Friend should have raised this topic. There has been a sort of ecclestiastical undertone to our debate. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to advise the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr Hogg) that the chapter to which he referred has already been enacted by the Lord President and the Lord Justice General in Acts of Adjournal. The oaths concerning jurors and witnesses are now the common form
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
and replace the previous oaths. Certainly, the oath read out to jurors was quite incomprehensible and probably did not make sense even in the English—or Scots—at the time when it was composed. I believe that it was a corruption, and stated in part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"you will truth say and no truth conceal, so far as you are to pass on this assize".</p></blockquote>
As nobody knew what passing on an assize was—whether it was handing round a parcel, for example—new oaths have been introduced that have nothing to do with the matter of oaths of judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a judicial examination under the law of Scotland the person has been judicially admonished and examined at length and has had to say at the end of the examination "All of which I declare to be the truth." Therefore, the person was on oath and the point about an oath is a very simple matter in law: it is no offence in law to lie but it is an offence in law to lie on oath. I hope that satisfies the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Solicitor-General say that he wanted the oath retained for use in the judicial examination? He wants to make sure that if we do not get them in one way we shall get them in another—I believe that is roughly what he is saying and I think he is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 7, line 13, leave out from 'above' to end of line 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been moving fairly quickly through a series of amendments which have been at least partially probing. We now come to an amendment of real substance which I am sure the Committee will want to examine—not, I hope, in tedious detail but with some care. If the Committee will examine subsection (5) of new clause 20A it will be seen that the amendment seeks to take out a large part of that clause. If we are successful subsection (5) will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An accused may decline to answer a question under subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part that is excised, as the Committee will instantly recognise, is that which goes on to say that at the subsequent trial of the accused, if he ad-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
vances any evidence which could appropriately have been stated at his judicial examination his failure then to state it can be the subject of adverse comment by the trial judge or the prosecutor in his address to the jury. This is one of the fundamentally controversial parts of the judicial examination because it is on the right of adverse comment that the attack on the right of silence, is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall introduce this matter in a few short sentences while reserving the right to return to it after I have heard the Solicitor-General on the subject. My contention is that if we were to remove the right to comment adversely we should be removing a great deal of the anxiety about the provision and would be placating, if that is not too undignified a word, those of us who have genuine fears about how it may operate. On this occasion I shall not quote from memoranda, a plethora of which lie before me. I believe that the Solicitor-General well knows that he is ploughing a lonely furrow if he intends to maintain this right to adverse comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly hope that the Solicitor-General will be prepared to accept that it is quite monstrous if an individual who is on trial on a very serious charge—after all, this applies only to cases which are being taken on indictment and solemn procedure —is not able to maintain his age-old right to silence. If he exercises a right which has been seen for many years as a real bulwark of our criminal procedure system he should not be penalised or be open to attack in a speech to the jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That can be a devastating prospect which can undermine, often unfairly. I believe that the Solicitor-General might accept that because once the damage is done it is very difficult to undo it. Even if there are explanations as to why the accused originally did not speak up at the judicial examination, the very fact that he did not, which has been commented upon, can create prejudice in the mind of a juryman, perhaps not skilled in the technicalities and difficulties which can arise, which is very hard to erase, overcome and remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is an essential mistake to maintain in the Bill this right to comment adversely upon the exercising of a right to silence and I certainly hope that the Government will think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in an earlier debate that we might breach the line here, and be saying rather casually "Oh, for some petty convenience,
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
because the Solicitor-General has an understandable but over-exaggerated worry about false alibis, we can presume to throw out the presumption of innocence." It would apply to a limited extent, but to some extent, and would certianly encroach seriously on the right to silence. If this were so, we should be starting to trudge down a road to very dangerous places indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took as examples the whole matter of the right to silence which has been built in to clause 2, and where there would not be a right to adverse comment. I do not want to encourage the Solicitor-General to any excesses of which he has not yet thought. We could have the one that was being foisted on us just now, at some future date, when perhaps a Conservative successor may start tinkering about with the protection which we have still managed to maintain in the unfortunate introduction of clause 2, but at least with the retention of that one simple but very important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal at stake in this amendment. This is possibly the most important provision since our attempt to take out the right for the judicial examination to look into the matters averred in the charge. That was the other important point, and we lost on that. If I may say so, we got short shrift on that point. I do not want to embarrass the Solicitor-General by saying that we were treated with contempt, but it might have been seen as such by someone who had just come into the Committee and who was not aware of the hon. and learned Gentleman's peculiar and inimitable style. I hope that we shall have a more civilised and helpful reception for this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, many of the Solicitor-General's arguments have been in terms of allowing an innocent party an immediate opportunity of clearing his name by making a statement. Frankly, I have not a great deal of sympathy with that argument, for the reasons that I gave earlier. I think that that is possible anyway under existing machinery. But, misguidedly or otherwise, that is the main motivation for clause 6 in the mind of the Solicitor-General. It is the only argument, or the main argument, that he has attempted to adduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main arguments, to be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main arguments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
—I am being encouraged to be a little fairer here. To be fair, I think that the other argument was the attack upon bogus alibis. But one of the main arguments that the Solicitor-General has advanced is that it gives the innocent party that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By adopting this amendment and taking out the dangerous right to comment adversely on the exercise of the right to silence, we still leave what the hon. and learned Gentleman sees as one of the useful principal purposes of judicial examination —the right of an innocent party to make a declaration and immediately put his defence on public view, and possibly encourage the dropping of the whole case as a result. If that is one of the principal reasons for the whole edifice. We are not undermining it nor attacking its joists, and we are not biting into its foundations by taking away this unfortunate innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to set out what is probably a pretty self-apparent case for this amendment. I hope that we get a somewhat more cheerful answer than we have had up to now. It is an important point and one where I hope that even at this late date we may have some signs of movement from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be helpful if I were to advise the Committee as to the present position. No comment can be made in law on the fact that a person fails to give evidence. That comment cannot be made by the judge, or by the prosecutor, and it would be unlikely to be made by the defence. Therefore the right to silence is presently protected. Under the Bill no comment, similarly, can be made about any person who remains silent at judicial examination and continues to remain so in the case, or indeed who does not remain silent at judicial examination but remains silent in the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, comment can be made about silence. If a person explains from the witness box how he had a jemmy, a mask, explosives, screwdrivers, wires and batteries in his motor car, and had not previously given any explanation, in cross-examination he will be asked "When did you first think that story up? You know perfectly well that you have waited until you heard the evidence in order to make up this preposterous story."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In law in precedent comment can be made on previous silence. So there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
change in the law now. I am sure that if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Gardscadden (Mr. Dewar) were ever recruited to the ranks of the prosecution or drafted, after a disastrous electoral defeat, to the procurator fiscal service in which his loquacity will no doubt be welcome, he would be the first to ask "How do you know that you were at granny's on 3rd January? How do you know which day of the week it was? How do you know that you were there at at 3 pm? Why didn't you tell anyone at the time? Have you not just made that up after discovering where you were supposed to be?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are all legitimate comments on what can be dressed up as silence. The law is not being changed in this matter at all. Such comment can be made, There is no reason whatever why a person should not be given the chance to state the basis of his innocence at the first opportunity. It is obvious that a person will be able to do that with more accuracy and a greater freshness of recollection, the sooner he is asked for that after the events in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the type of comments that can be made by the prosecutor, or the judge in the charge to the jury—such as, "You may think it very odd, Ladies and Gentlemen, that the accused has not come forward with this explanation before today, but that is a matter for you"—are perfectly legitimate in law at present. But the purpose of judicial examination is to enable the innocent to state their case immediately and. If they wish to repeat it they are in the position of immunity. They may say "You have not the evidence and nothing that I say can add to the matter. Therefore, I say nothing."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were passed it would mean that a person at judicial examination could say "I was there, but I did not have anything in my hand" or "I was not in Sauchiehall Street at the time of the fight", or "I was there and I saw it but did not take part". Discovering from the evidence of two nurses that they saw him taking part, he could then give evidence at the trial that he had tried to help people and not to kick them. He could then give a different explanation. It would be absurd if such evidence were before the jury and could not be a matter of comment. It would be unrealistic because both pieces of evidence would be before the jury. It would be bound to be a matter of comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the greatest respect, I reassure the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that I shall regrettably retain the ghost of Braxfield, although if my history is correct, the words were spoken by an equally thrawn judge called Eskgrove. But whichever it was, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the whole question of an accused person's right to remain silent, despite what the late Lord Thomson and his committee said in their second report—on which clause 6 of the Bill is based—would not the Solicitor-General accept that there is a danger that prosecutors will use the fact that someone had exercised the right to remain silent at the time of judicial examination as corroboration of some other evidence that is led in the prosecution? I know that Lord Thomson, in this second report said that the prosecutor will still have to prove his case based on corroboration. What we are talking about here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could never provide corroboration. All it does is go to the credibility of the accused when he gives his explanation of innocence or his defence. It cannot provide corroboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicotor General, because I was coming to precisely that point. The problem is the circumstances in which the statements will be made by the prosecutor, and indeed by the judge himself, because it is clear that the trial judge also has the right to refer to the fact that the accused person refused to answer questions, or could have answered the question during his judicial examination, that has subsequently been raised at the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fine legal point. Trained legal minds will appreciate that the mere mention of that is not corroboration of the evidence that has been led. I submit that ordinary lay people serving on a jury will not take the same meaning from it as the trained legal mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in the summing-up, the prosecutor, or even the judge, mentions that the accused refused to answer some questions during the judicial examination that have since emerged at the trial, I am absolutely certain that, if there is a doubt in the minds of the jurors, a mere mention by the prosecutor or the trial judge will sway the juror
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
against the accused. That position does not prevail at the moment. We are therefore saying that, yet again, the balance has swung quite dramatically—not in a minor manner—against the accused. I am well aware that the late Lord Thomson said in his second report that the last that a person did not make these statements during judicial examination cannot be used as corroboration. That is absolutely true. We all accept that. We are involved in the debates, but nevertheless that will not be the realistic position when these matters are mentioned before a jury. I refuse to believe that juries do not become emotionally involved in cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Solicitor-General would agree that juries become emotionally involved in cases, and here we have a situation where a jury is emotionally involved in a case for a week or 10 days. There is some doubt in the juror's mind, and then, lo and behold, the statement is made that these questions could have been answered during judicial examination, but were not answered. "It is for you, ladies and gentlemen", as the Solicitor-General says, "to consider what reason the accused person might have had for not answering". In my view, that would sway the jury and it is for these reasons that I am keen to support the proposal contained in amendment No. 77.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a genuine danger, and I hope that I have expressed my fears in a manner that illustrates our concern not about the full question of judicial examination but certainly about these various aspects of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In earlier debates in the Committee, Mr. Armstrong, at which you were unfortunately not present, although you may consider that to be a good fortune rather than a misfortune—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—on several amendments that we put down I seem to remember the Solicitor-General or the Under-Secretary of State, or on occasions even some of the other Government Members, replying in rather scornful terms, particularly to the non-lawyers on the Opposition Benches, "That is already in law. It is already part of the common law of Scotland, so why are you putting this amendment in? It is not necessary. We do not require it." I seem
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
to remember, as I am sure my hon. Friends do, that argument being adduced on the Government Benches, particularly by the Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet now the Solicitor-General tells us that the major reason for allowing this part of the Bill to remain in the Bill instead of being taken out by amendment is "Don't worry, lads. It doesn't matter. It is already in Scottish law. It is already part of our law that this situation can arise in these terms." If it is the existing law, why on earth did he put it in the Bill in the first place? I thought that one of the points of any Bill before Parliament was to change the law, not to keep reiterating it over and over again in a piece of legislation. Yet that is exactly what the Solicitor-General adduced as his only defence for retaining this part of the Bill, saying "It is already in the law, so let us keep it in."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be the best argument that I have heard for accepting my hon. Friend's amendment. If the hon. and learned Gentleman did so, it would not make any difference. It is a great point of concession. He can suddenly give us something. He can say to us "Here you are, lads, I shall give you that amendment. I am being kind, I am being generous, I am being conciliatory to you. For the first time tonight I am actually going to say that I accept the amendment." In his heart of hearts he knows that it will not make a blind bit of difference, because, as he says, it is already in Scottish law. It will not make any difference to anything. This will still take place; it will still happen. In his arguments that is the case, so why he did not accept the amendment I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason I can think of why the hon. and learned Gentleman did not accept it is that he did not really mean what he said. There is something here— my non-legal mind cannot find it, but I have a suspicion that it is there—is a change from the existing situation. It is different. Something is taking place here that will put the accused person who has been through the judicial examination, if he remains silent at that point, into a worse position than he would normally be in in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not the case, there is no reason for retaining the provision if it is already in existing law. Therefore, a change is taking place. At present, if a person remains silent and then gives an answer to a question which he is asked in the trial itself, the judge or the prosecutor may say to him
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
"You have just made that story up"—I think that that was the example given by the Solicitor-General—and hint at the fact that he had remained silent at the judicial examination, without saying it directly. Under this provision, a judge, especially in his summing-up, or the prosecuting counsel may say directly "On that part the accused was silent during the judicial examination. He has now given an answer to those questions. It is for you, members of the jury, to decide whether you feel that he should have answered them."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is a change here, and that the accused person is having his rights eroded, particularly his right to remain silent. Many members of the Opposition have already given examples of ways in which a person would, as a matter of course, remain silent at the judicial examination because he had not had a proper opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General has said that a fraud case, for instance, would not come before a judicial examination. I am not sure whether he can guarantee that it would not do so. It may well do so. Can you imagine, Mr. Armstrong, that you are suddenly accused of fraud over three or four years? At the judicial examination the prosecutor asks you whether, on 14 June 1976, you did change that account in that book from that figure to that figure. Even if a man is on the swindle, he probably does not remember exactly when he changed what figures in what books at what time. Probably rightly, therefore, he would say "I refuse to answer". If he is innocent, he will still refuse to answer because he can give no proper defence. Yet the fact that he says "I will give no answer. I wish to prepare my case. I am remaining silent at this point" will apparently count against him, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Granegemouth (Mr. Ewing) said, when he comes to trial and may, if it is evenly balanced, be the factor that tips him into prison as opposed to keeping him out of it. I am, therefore, happy to support my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a brief debate. Indeed, I admire the restraint of some of my hon. Friends. I hope that that will put a lie to any suggestion that there has been deliberate filibustering on the Opposition's part. I think that we have paced through the Bill at a steady trot, although it has been a somewhat unrewarding exercise. In-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
deed, we have put a complicated argument into small compass—as, I should say in fairness, was shown by the Solicitor-General in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General said that he came with regret to the conclusion that he could not accept the amendment. I had the impression that the regret was somewhat perfunctory, but I suppose I should not complain as the civilities were observed at least in skeleton form. I hasten to say that the Solicitor-General's point of view has been much improved by the efforts of members of another place. This was a particularly weak part of the proposal until their Lordships got to work. Their efforts have limited its damage to some extent. As one who on occasions is highly critical of another place, I should record that on this Occasion it has performed, perhaps a minor, but still useful, function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have immense sympathy with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). With great clarity at this time of the morning, when it is easy to let the Solicitor-General's low monotone go past unheeded and un-comprehended, he followed closely what was said and put his finger on an important fallacy in the Solicitor-General's argument As I understand it, the Solicitor-General was trying to say that the proposition that we are attempting to eliminate—that there should be the right of adverse comment— was a total misunderstanding because that right of adverse comment existed at common law in any case. But, even if that provision were taken out, the advocate depute at a High Court trial, or the judge when he came to sum up, could make exactly the same remarks as he would be able to make under the provisions of these particularly disputed lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart said—and how right he was—if that is the position, quite clearly these words are totally redundant and they ought to be taken out. I have heard the Solicitor-General in a more frisky mood, perhaps earlier in the day—around or after tiffin perhaps—waxing eloquent on the subject of the need to do without otiose verbiage in the statutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg] that he is not stiff enough.
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
That is an interesting misunderstanding. Tiffin is the strange ceremony which takes us back to the days of the Imperial Raj when clothes were being tailored as worn by the Solicitor-General today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the point is serious and important. If the Solicitor-General is right—I do not think that he is but let us give him credit by assuming that he is right for a moment.— quite clearly we should all be united in a campaign, which he normally wages with such enthusiasm, to take out of the Bill the words which the amendment attempts to excise on the grounds that they are totally redundant, unnecessary and otiose. That is the very word, because the Solicitor-General is also noted for his Johnsonese— his ability to pick a word of classical derivation, however obscure and clumsy. I believe that "otiose" is the word which in his friskier moods, he would have chosen to describe these totally unnecessary words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General is right, we should be voting for the amendment on the ground that we do not need these words. If we take a more sinister view of his arguments and decide that he is wrong, clearly, we should be voting against these words and taking them out of the Bill, because, if he is wrong, and we are right on the likely results, they are an encroachment of the right to silence and dangerous in themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, whichever way we take the argument, whichever side of the intellectual battle we fall—if I may dignify it with that term at this time of the morning—and whichever side of the line we come down, it is quite clear that there is an unanswerable case for the amendment. I believe that I can claim that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I for a moment examine the case on the basis that the Solicitor-General is wrong in saying that the words are redundant and do not change the common law and the rights of advocate deputes and judges. I think that he is wrong because this does not say that it is open to adverse comment. I believe there would be a stronger moral case if something said in evidence, either by the accused or by one of his defence witnesses, which was directly incompatible with something that he said or advanced at judicial examination, were open to adverse comment. But, as the Bill stands, it is open to adverse comment merely if something said in evidence was not advanced at judicial examination. It does not need to be incompatible with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
something said at a judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrefutable logic flows from that. I am sure that the Committee will take this point and that there will be no quarrel about it. One can only exercise a right of silence in safety if one does not advance any evidence in one's own defence. That is often an admission of considerable weakness—sitting tight and hoping that there is an insufficiency of Crown evidence or confusion about identification, or something of that nature. My experience—I speak with the voice of experience which will be shares by others—is that if there is a good defence it is almost always positively advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, if one positively advances a defence of any kind and one has been silent at the time of judicial examination, one is open to adverse comment. There does not need to be any internal contradiction. That is why I find this proposition so peculiarly damaging to the concept of the right of silence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General properly referred to the fact that where the rights of silence exists is in its condemnation and ruling out of court of any comment by a council or a judge of the failure of the accused to give evidence. But he went on to say that this was a very different situation; he likened it more to cross-examination along the lines of "When did you think this up? Why did you not say that to your solicitor earlier?" and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most extreme example of his line of argument would be a situation, such as has often happened to me, in which, when suddenly when giving defence evidence in the wintess box, the accused produces a line of defence which has not been put to the Crown witnesses. Immediately he is open to the examination "Why did you not tell your solicitor about this?" Sometimes the solicitor is setting there trembling and thinking "My God, he did, and I nearly forgot to put it to the Crown witnesses." But leaving that possibility aside, that is the extreme and clear illustration of the kind of situation, with which the Solicitor-General was trying to draw a parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where that parallel falls down is that a fair comparison is not with that kind of situation, but with a situation in which someone chooses not to give evidence. It seems that that is a fair parallel. If one is protected—in other words, if no one can
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
comment adversely on the failure to give evidence—it is fair to extend the same privilege and protection to the failure, or in more neutral terms, the decision not, to make any statement at the point of judicial examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am strengthened in that view by the debates we have had in the last eight or nine hours. The very fact, for example, that the Government insist on putting a person in judicial examination on oath is an implicit admission that they see judicial examination as akin to giving evidence. I do not think that there is any dispute that that is their view, and that that is how seriously they take the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just the equivalent of a precognition, or a consultation with one's solicitor, or anything of that sort. I think that the Solicitor-General is right is saying that one can be cross-examined on why one did not put one's defence in proper order to advance the case to the Crown witnesses and to test their credibility against it. It is on all fours not with that, but with the giving of evidence. That is why in both cases, and only in those cases, is someone put on oath solemnly to tell the truth and is subject to the full pains of perjury if he transgresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts the basic contention that judicial examination is a form of premature evidence—that, so far as I can see, is what it is in every particular—it is clear that the decision not to give evidence at that stage should have the same protection and freedom from adverse comment as a decision at the trial itself not to go into the box. It seems to me that at the earlier stage it is particularly important that it gets that protection, perhaps even more important than in giving evidence at the trail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is giving evidence at the trial, although one is open to the full test and the rigours of cross-examination, one has at least listened to the preceding evidence, one has had the benefit of full advice from one's solicitor and possibly counsel. One is prepared in every way, and has thought out one's own motives and knows exactly what will happen. But at the judicial examination stage, when one's arm is being twisted to give evidence at an early stage, one has not had proper advice, seen the strength of the Crown case, had consultation with counsel or seen the precognitions from the Crown witnesses. In those circumstances, if one decides that one does not wish to give evidence—that is the analogy—it seems proper that one should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
be protected in the same way as if one takes the same decision at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if the Solicitor-General' opening contentions are right, the amendment is taking away words that we neither need nor want. If the Solicitor-General is wrong and I am right in saying that the comparision is with the decision not to give evidence, his explanation of the law, which I do not controvert, means that that is absolutely privileged against adverse comment by judge and counsel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either way it seems that we have an extremely strong case for the amendment. It has widespread support. Its acceptance and its passing into statute would give a great deal of peace of mind to a very large number of genuine, politically non-committed people who have expressed anxiety, concern and alarm at the ramifications and the likely side effects of byproducts, in terms of the erosion of basic liberties and basic rights under civil procedure as a result of clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given up the Solicitor-General, Mr. Armstrong, to tell you the truth. I do not think that we are likely to have any death-bed repentance on his part, but I appeal to other members of the Committee and remind them, I hope not in vain, that there were many people in previous discussions on the Bill who were prepared to break ranks on matters of principle and</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I put it to you that, in the interests of proper and comprehensive debate on a clause that has been substantially amended by the Government themselves, we really should have a stand part debate. This clause did not appear in the Labour Government's Bill. It is a completely new concept in Scottish law.

ment amendments were unopposed. In addition to that, at the express request of Opposition Members, there was a very full debate on the first group of amendments which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) himself suggested should cover the wide range of the clause. All the hon. Gentlemen who were present during that debate will agree, I am sure.

The Government did not even take the trouble to explain their own amendments.

Friend—indeed, he did so even before the debate began—that on a previous debate he had allowed us to go much wider than was his intention, and it was not his intention to allow me and my hon. Friends to go wide on this set of amendments. I dispute what the Under-Secretary says, Mr. Armstrong. My submission to you is that in order to resolve the matter a reasonable approach would be to have a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should intervene here since I have been referred to. Further to that point of order, Mr. Armstrong. I am afraid that my hon. Friend has not got it exactly right. It was not true, whatever was said by the Minister just now, that we went wide. The point that was made—I have to explain this, Mr. Armstrong, because you were not here—was that I had initial amendments. I then suggested that instead of me making the case for these initial amendments it would be useful for everyone, especially as there were so many new Government amend-

ments and a completely new principle, if the Solicitor-General took the opportunity of outlining the aims, purpose and content of the clause. For that reason, I deliberately did not speak at any length at all. I did not go wide and the Solicitor-General briefly outlined the function of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did that as a courtesy to the Committee. I was thanked for it as a courteesy to the Committee. It is very rough that the Under-Secretary should call that in aid in order to try to prevent a clause stand part debate.

The truth is that we have not debated this most important principle. I understand why you should feel like this, Mr. Armstrong; we have discussed clause 6 for many hours. Part of the reason for that has been the Government's amendments. We welcomed them, but they were needed. But I assure you, Mr. Armstrong, that the principle has never been fully engaged. I have made references in two ways in referring to the inquisitorial and the accusatorial. I have used it as a shorthand, but without in either case dealing with the principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are present at a historic occasion, Mr. Armstrong. You are participating in a massive change in the history of Scottish judicial procedure. We would be doing a great disservice to the people of Scotland, the law of Scotland and the House if such a massive change in principle were not debated at least until, perhaps, 6 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I understand it, this is a matter for my judgment, and my judgment is not subject to question. Hon. Members are not out of order in raising the matter but in the end the question is for me to decide. It is my opinion that the principle, and indeed any matters arising from it, have been discussed on the various amendments that have been moved. This is not just a matter of time or of anything else; the question is whether the principle and the various questions that arise have been discussed. I think they have been discussed. I therefore propose to put the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 6.</p>
	<p>3.50 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
