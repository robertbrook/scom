<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. May I explain the absence of the Under-Secretary of State? He was ill last Thursday and was good enough to attend the Committee despite his illness, but today he is incapable of being with us for that reason. I am sure we wish him a speedy recovery. I regret to say that I have contracted part 1 of his condition, but I hope I last the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I join with the Solicitor-General in wishing the Under-Secretary well, and hope that we shall soon see him back with us and recovered from his illness.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I do not want to delay the Committee but I was under the impression, as were my hon. Friends, that the Solicitor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
General was on his feet when we adjourned and that his argument against the amendment had got as far as accusing certain people of paranoid humbuggery but had not proceeded very much further. I was perhaps working on the rather optimistic assumption that we would get an argument from the Solicitor-General and that he would resume his speech. If not, I am sure that some of my hon. Friends would want to contribute to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My colleagues and I had thought that the Solicitor-General would continue his speech, largely because he had not really said anything up to the point when we adjourned last time. Since he asked us to treat the Bill seriously, we had hoped for a little more seriousness in response, which is perhaps another reason for regretting the absence of the Under-Secretary. We all sympathise with him over the specific reason for his absence.<br><br>
I understand that this addition to the Bill—the compelling of witnesses to give their names and addresses—springs from the belief that that which is moral should be made legal. The main justification that I have heard in remarks made during the debate in the other place—the simplification of it made by the Minister of State at the Scottish Office—was that it was a question of making that which was moral a legal liability. In law and in morality the position is not quite as simple as that. There are numerous examples of cases where that which is immoral is not illegal. One remembers the classic response that Cyril Osborne once gave during the moving of a Bill to make legal homosexual practices between adults in privacy. In the course of inveighing against it he tried to make the equation between sin and crime, whereupon Eric Lubbock, as he then was, interrupted him and said, "After all, adultery is a sin, but it is not a crime"— except in Saudi Arabia. He got the classic response from Cyril Osborne "One question at a time".<br><br>
One is, therefore, always nervous about bringing in that which is immoral as a crime for no other reason than that it is a sin. That is manifestly true in this case. We have to decide whether it is conducive to law and order to bring in this clause, and, if it is conducive to law and order—which I hope to show it is not—whether it is balanced or counter-balanced by the effect it has on the liberty of the individual citizen.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
One can think of numerous examples in history which disprove absolute. One can do it very simply by looking at the experience of Nazi Germany—and, indeed, other countries—in this century, when we all applauded, as basic supporters of law and order as we would understand it, those who were busy in breaking the law because they would not accept the law of Nazi Germany.<br><br>
That is the absolute, so the absolute goes. We now have to look at the relative. Many of us are worried by the relationship between the law that is proposed here and the law that is proposed in the Employment Bill on the question of picketing. We are immediately confronted with two moralities, the morality of law and the morality of those people who believe in a rather higher argument—that that which they are doing is justified and moral. Before looking at the immediate position, let us recall the infamous Industrial Relations Act 1971 of the previous Tory Administration. In implementation of the law we were stupid enough inevitably to have made arrests. The law was a bad law yet had to be fulfilled. That is the trouble with bad law. We pass bad laws and then have to carry them out. The persons carrying it out, as you will recall, Mr. Gourlay, arrested five dockers. They were then put in an intolerable position because most of the working people of this country could not recognise that what the five dockers had done was wrong. We all recognised that it was illegal, and therefore there was a clash between the morality of acceptance of the law and the morality of accepting that that which was wrong should be opposed.<br><br>
The action taken by the Government was to avoid the dilemma, not by abolishing the law—the Labour Government had to do that—but by using a legal device. We had the "tipstaff through the tulips"—the pulling in of the Official Solicitor in order to get the five dockers released. First, the law was a bad law. Secondly, it was broken by people who were acting, in terms of any other kind of judgment, in a correct fashion. Thirdly, in order to avoid the dilemma, the Government had to use a piece of legal trickery. This does nothing but bring the law into contempt. Therefore, on the question whether it is conducive to law and order to pass a bad law such as this, that is our answer.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
Why is this a bad law? It is a bad law, first, because it infringes the liberty of the individual. Secondly, it is a bad law because it is of itself conducive to law breaking. I refer again to the Employment Bill. There are strong feelings engendered on a picket line. Inevitably, picketing arises out of disputes, and this by definition means conflict. Inevitably, with the best will in the world on all sides, there is tension, hostility and conflict. In that situation, the worst possible thing to happen is for the police to be seen, rightly or wrongly, to be acting apparently on one side in a conflict which has arisen for perfectly right and legal reasons. I do not say the police take sides but that the law would force them to do so.<br><br>
Secondly, the action that the police would be taking, far from easing the situation, would exacerbate it. If the Employment Bill goes through, the laws on picketing will be tightened up. Many, many working people in this country genuinely feel that the kinds of definitions that the Government have taken regarding secondary picketing are wrong and, because they are wrong, they are immoral. People see the suppliers of a firm with whom they are in dispute as themselves part of that dispute, whatever the law may say. Suppose that, arising out of this, action is taken under the law to prevent pickets doing what they regard as their moral duty—to stop people in order to talk to them and seek an opportunity to discuss with them—and a policeman intervenes, and an incident occurs with someone who brushed aside a picket during a period of tension such as this. The policeman then seeks to get the name and address of all the witnesses.<br><br>
On a picket line there could be as many as a dozen people and probably more, all of whom would be witnesses, but all of whom would regard the law as wrong and therefore be unwilling to give their name and address, because they could then be called to court and under oath would have to tell the truth about the incident. In the process of telling the truth about the incident they would, as they see it, have immorally punished someone who took part in the picket line and was accused following the incident, whatever it was—an argument with a policeman or whatever.<br><br>
In other words, one is imposing an intolerable strain by producing a clash between the desire to do that which is lawful and the desire to do that which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
right. For that reason, many of them would seek to refuse to give their name and address. The moment they have done so, they are then faced with the question of punishment. You will recall, Mr. Gourlay, that among the punishments for nonpayment of a fine there could be imprisonment.<br><br>
The effect of this on industrial relations would be catastrophic. Certainly its effect would be that other people would be prepared to test the law—indeed, they would be justified—in order to get rid of a bad law, because they feel they are doing no more than exercising what they regard as a right. Therefore, from the very moment of conflict—I do not use this in a high sense, but in the low sense of "dispute"—the law itself is exacerbated and a situation is brought about which would be exactly the opposite of the fulfilment of law and order.<br><br>
This is the crucial question which we have to decide; it is the first point of our objection. The proposed law is not of itself conducive to law and order but is opposed to it and helps to break it down.<br><br>
We then come to the second plank, which is the freedom of the individual. On this matter a good deal of discussion took place in the Lords. Most of those who spoke were opposed to the proposal. For example, Lord Wigoder, a reasonable man, deployed the case against it. His argument was a very practical one. First, he argued on the liberty of the subject—the right of someone to go about his own business untrammelled and without having to explain why he is going about his business, if it is lawful business. That, in fact, would be interference. But, even more, Lord Wigoder—he is talking about a situation in which a number of young people are around and an incident takes place—says
<br><blockquote><p>"It is seriously suggested that if the police have have the power to detain these youths and if necessary arrest them, they will suddenly find they have on their hands a whole series of willing witnesses who otherwise would not have been available."</p></blockquote>
He goes onto say:
<br><blockquote><p>"If people want to help the police they will help the police. They should help the police. But it is idle to pretend that they can be compelled to help the police and make statements assisting them in the way that this clause contemplates."</p></blockquote>
[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 January, 1980; Vol. 404, col. 701]<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
In other words, compounding the loss of freedom to the individual and the infringement of the rights of the individual there comes—buttressing the same point which I made earlier—the fact that that in itself is not conducive to law and order, because there will be unwilling and unhelpful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that, although we may be in some difficulty, since this Bill has been before the House of Lords, nevertheless the rules which apply to Standing Committees are that hon. Members are not allowed to refer to speeches of Members of the House of Lords unless they be Government Ministers.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to a definition in a quotation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members cannot quote from a speech nor may they refer to a speech other than by inference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say, then, that in another place a discussion took place in which a number of undisclosed aristocrats took part? Under the proposed law, people are compelled to give their names and addresses when they may be unwilling to do so, but in the case of their Lordships —I should have thought they would be delighted to give their names and addresses —we are unable to do so. Others of these obscure and unnamed gentlemen also made objections. There was one who suggested that the whole history of the granting of new laws and of new powers short of arrest, is that, in the event, they are used far more often upon those who are innocent than upon those who are guilty. If I could have mentioned him, he would have referred to measures relating to the misuse of drugs; he might even have referred to the prevention of terrorism. He suggested that any such powers given to the police inevitably infringe far more upon those who are innocent than upon those who are guilty. Another of those gentlemen, who might have been at one time Provost of Glasgow, also objected on practical grounds and referred to the problems facing the police.<br><br>
Therefore, on every count, the more one examines it, the more one recognises that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
this is a massive step backwards. It is a major infringement of rights. There are all sorts of reasons why people might not wish to give their names and addresses.<br><br>
I remember an occasion when I was going about my lawful business which, in accordance with the byelaws of Glasgow, was whitewashing the streets. I was advertising a meeting which was being held that Sunday in relation to the Korean war. I had been playing tennis; I had on white flannels and white shoes and my wife was accompanying me. I had got as far as writing "7.30, Sunday" when I heard a whisper from my wife to say, "Watch it" and, as I continued to whitewash the street, I became aware of a pair of boots. I do not know whether Conservative Members have ever whitewashed the streets but it is a very difficult business. One is down on one's hunkers for a very long time. It is a painful business. One does not stop and get up if one can avoid it, so I went on. I looked upwards from the boots and there was a policeman who said, "What do you think you are doing?", to which I replied "I am whitewashing the street." That was absolutely truthful, and a verifiable fact. He said "You are not allowed to do that" and I said "Since when?" I was young. I might not have done it if this type of law had been passed. He said "There was something in the police station today saying that this was no longer allowed." I said "From time immemorial the people of Glasgow have been allowed the chance to whitewash the streets." He said "Would you like to come with me to verify that?", to which I replied "Certainly." I picked up my bucket of whitewash and brush. I was accompanied by my wife. At one point I told her to keep on the other side of the road, so she did.<br><br>
We reached the police box, whereupon the policeman telephoned through and obviously was warned that he had somebody on his hands who was likely to disturb a hornets' nest. I should add that, on the way to the police box, every few yards he said "I see you are advertising a man called R. Elhone"—no relation to anyone in this House. He said "Are you R. McElhone?" I said "No." He said "What is your name?" I said "It is none of your business what my name is." Having settled that, we decided to move on. After another 100 yards he said "What about your name?" I said "No, you are not going to get my name." This went on for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
some time. When he telephoned to the police station he obviously got a ticking off because what he was doing was wrong. I could hear him being told to get rid of me as quickly as he could. He turned round and said "It seems that you are allowed to advertise a meeting, but not to paint slogans," to which I said "If you go down Shawlands Road you will see slogans painted the whole length of the road." He said "Can I have your name and address?" I said "No, you cannot." He said "I really need it." I said "Why?" He said that he might get into trouble. I said that that was all right, I would not report him—no problem at all. I stepped off the pavement and was almost knocked down by a car. I leapt back and said "That car nearly got me." "Yes," he said, "I'd have got your name and address then."<br><br>
That is an example of somebody going about his normal business. Not only would I now have been detained because he suspected that I was committing a crime, although I knew I was not, but my wife would have been detained, presumably as a witness. A very interesting question might have developed. Could she be compelled to give evidence against me? All this would have been blown up. An embittered man would have emerged after his detention and an embittered witness would have emerged—people scarred for life.<br><br>
In all seriousness, this is a dangerous step to take. It is part of the same process that we have been seeing from this Government of the continued encroachment of authority upon the liberty of the individual. If the Labour Party and the Socialist movement stands for anything, it stands for the liberty of the individual. It is part of the process of switching legal behaviour into administrative behaviour, because detention has not the legal safeguard and the legal redress that arrest has. This switching, which is running through all the legislation, is harmful. This is only one part of it but a regrettable part, and I call on all my hon. Friends to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I start, Mr. Gourlay, by congratulating you and the management of the House of Commons on obtaining a considerably better room in which to conduct our business than the one we were in last week? You have done it most expeditiously and we are all grateful to you.<br><br>
It is remarkable that at the beginning of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
the debate the Solicitor-General did not rise to his feet to continue his remarks. If one looks at the record of Thursday's sitting, one finds that he was in the middle of a sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"In no circumstances could it be suggested—"</p></blockquote>
[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April, 1980: col. 115.]<br><br>
If he had completed the sentence, we might have been able to continue with a little more expedition, but we now have to continue the debate. We are not sure what the Government's views on it are, because the Solicitor-General did not tell us. All he did was to be wildly abusive to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for certain remarks which he had made.<br><br>
This clause is important, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has said, because it raises some very important issues. However, I want to stick to the practical effects of what this is all about and why it was introduced. If one looks at the Thomson Committee report on the detention of witnesses, one will find that the only example it can quote on why this law should be introduced is to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Situations arise in which it is necessary for the police to detain people for short periods in order to obtain their names and addresses so that they may be subsequently examined as witnesses. This may occur, for example, when an assault has been committed in a crowded dance hall. The police have at present no legal authority to prevent people from leaving until they have given their names and addresses."</p></blockquote>
On the second part I am not quite certain, even under this clause, whether the police would have the authority to lock doors and keep people in. If they did, I should have thought that the fire authorities might have a great deal to say about it, because one would create in that case a considerable fire hazard by locking all the doors so that no one could get out. The only example they quoted was that of an assault in a crowded dance hall.<br><br>
The clause as at present worded says that any other person who is a witness to any offence that has been committed can be held as a witness. That means any single person for any offence. It may be a motoring offence. For example, an elderly lady may be standing waiting to cross at the traffic lights. A motor car goes through on orange, just as the lights are changing. The policeman turns to the old lady and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
says "Did you see that?" She says "What?' He says "You are a witness. I have no other witness. You are a witness and I insist that you give your name and address." The old lady says "But look. I'm no use to you. I don't even know what the law is on traffic lights. I have never driven a motor car. I've no idea. My eyesight isn't very good. I can't really see the colours on the traffic lights from where I am standing anyway, so what use am I? What is the purpose of my giving you my name and address?" The constable says "Sorry, the law is you must give your name and address. We insist you give it and we shall call you as a witness." The old lady is in an impossible position. She has to give her name and address because that is the law. She is totally and utterly useless to the policeman as a witness. If she goes into the witness box, all she can say is "I'm sorry, I didn't see anything", and that would be the truth. She happens to be the only person there whom the constable can use to get that driver into the dock. That is one example of people who would be brought into witness boxes as witnesses, who are totally unnecessary to the case, and who will feel that they are being put upon by the law.<br><br>
I had an example rather like this on one occasion. I was driving down the A74 just south of Locherbie. A lorry had been driving down the outside lane at about 6 mph consistently for about 10 miles, not allowing anyone to pass. Behind it was a police van with one policeman in it. I was behind the police van in my car. Eventually, after about 10 miles, the lorry pulled over into the inside lane. The police van then went past and pulled in and I went to overtake the police van. The next thing I knew was that the policeman was flagging me down. I was not quite certain whether he was flagging me down or the lorry, so I went to go past him. Eventually he managed to persuade me that he wanted me. If one is driving a car and a policeman flags one down, one gets a bit worried. The problem was that he was on his own and he required a witness to the fact that the lorry driver had been committing an offence. Being a law-abiding citizen, I pulled into a lay-by. The policeman jumped out and went off and flagged down the lorry. I gave my name and address; I heard nothing more about it, but I could quite easily have misunderstood that policeman's signal. I could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
have gone past him. I could have driven on down the road and could then have been stopped by the police and told "You failed to stop."<br><br>
I could have said, "So what? I did not know anything about it." Or I could have been in a great hurry and said, "I am sorry, I do not want to give my name. I have to get on." These things can happen. They are small examples. For very small gain, a lot of people could find themselves very severely inconvenienced, if the demand is made on them that they must give their name and address.<br><br>
There are lots of examples. Some of them were given in another place by the anonymous Lord who has been mentioned. A man may be walking home. He may be slightly drunk and want nothing to do with the police. He may be with his girl friend. He does not want to have any interference from the police when he is going home in that situation.<br><br>
Another example was quoted in a previous debate of a man who may be going about some business which is legal but not exactly moral. Therefore, again, he does not want to be put in a position where suddenly his wife discovers that he has been on rather illicit business. He gives his name and address, he comes up in court and, of course, his wife finds out about it.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
If it becomes a legal matter, one is putting people into that position and arguably, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has said, it is for very limited gain. If one has unwilling witnesses in terms of giving their names and addresses, one has unwilling witnesses in the witness box. I accept that by law, of course, someone is obliged not to tell lies in a witness box, because that is perjury; but certainly he may say as little as he can possibly get away with. One must answer the questions but if one says one does not know or did not see, that is an answer which cannot ultimately be disproved, and it is not perjury as such. At least, it is doubtful. I am happy to give way to an expert.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must pay tribute to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I can think of almost no situation in which, if the hon. Member were a witness and said
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
"I don't know" when it was obvious that he did, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden could not cross-examine him into the cells.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would never think of doing that. I still think that, if one has unwilling witnesses, it is clearly a very much more difficult job for the prosecution to continue. It is always better to have a willing witness—someone who, under a moral obligation, has felt that he ought to say something and be a witness. Once one starts to have compulsion, one is in trouble.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West very rightly raised the question of picketing and demonstrations. There are many of us who are very gravely concerned about what can happen here. What can happen, particularly with the new laws which the Government are introducing, is that large numbers of people can have their names and addresses taken as witnesses. Although the Government took out the clause which said that these people could be detained until their names were ascertained, I would argue that that is still possible under the clauses which we are trying to delete, because it is an offence to give a false name and address. If a policeman says that he believes that someone is giving a false name, he is entitled to detain that person—which is essentially to arrest him—until such time as the name is proved to be correct.<br><br>
Do not let us run away with the idea that the detention clause, in terms of witnesses, has been entirely taken away. It could happen, and the police could use it in the case of demonstrations and picketing. That is another argument which we have against the proposal.<br><br>
Another question—which again was raised in another place—is: what will happen to all these names and addresses taken down in dance halls, on picket lines and in demonstrations? What will happen to them in terms of police recording?<br><br>
We all know that the police these days have very highly technological expertise in recording material. They have computers on which all these names and addresses can be put, and in which the area or place in which these people were active is recorded as well. Thus, people who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in one single instance could find themselves recorded under a list of those who took
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
part in that demonstration, and therefore perhaps labelled thereafter by the police as trouble-makers, Lefties, and revolutionaries, and on the record as such, even though they had committed no crime or offence whatsoever, but because they were forced to give their names and addresses, they are therefore recorded on the police files as such.<br><br>
Perhaps there is an incident in a dance hall that is usually a reasonably respectable one. These people are regular attenders, and are perfectly respectable people. Suddenly they find that they are on police records as being regular attenders at this particular dance hall where there are incidents. At a disco, particularly for young people, the same thing could happen. Perfectly respectable people could find themselves on police records as a result of this law.<br><br>
What is to happen to all this information? There is nothing in the Bill to suggest that, if these names and addresses are not used and the people are not used as witnesses by the police—following any court proceedings or the release of the person because there was no case to be met and the person who was charged or taken into detention was freed—those records and those names would actually be destroyed. That is a very important point. People are very wary about having their names and addresses put on to police files in this way against their will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be getting <i>Reader's Digest</i> circulars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is evidently talking of something of which I do not know. I do not read the <i>Reader's Digest,</i> so perhaps he knows something that I do not.<br><br>
We have a problem here in terms of the names of people and the recording of them. The amendments we have put down are legitimate. We are trying to say that the right to give one's name and address as a witness in a particular sense is a moral obligation upon the public. If in fact we are being forced into the situation where it is no longer a moral obligation but becomes a legal obligation, the gains will be minimal, and we are then admitting that the bulk of the population no longer feels that that moral obligation is upon it. That is a very worrying thing indeed, in terms of law and order.<br><br>
It is our view that, if we have to put on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
that legal obligation, law and order is declining, and the clause will not make it better. It will make it worse, because it will sour relations between many ordinary, innocent people in our community and the police force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to take part in this debate, Mr. Gourlay, but one or two things have been said by my hon. Friends this morning which give cause for concern and to which, no doubt, the Solicitor-General will want to reply.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), is concerned—and the point is very relevant— that this legislation being passed through Parliament is related to legislation being passed through other Committees of the House, much of which—we are all realists, and the Government have a fairly substantial majority—we accept will go on the statute book.<br><br>
The point which my hon. Friend made about the secondary picketing aspect of an industrial dispute is very important indeed. I hope that the Solicitor-General will take the opportunity, when he comes to reply to the debate, to place firmly on the record that the police will only note the names of those people who would be expected to appear in court as witnesses, were court proceedings eventually to be taken against a suspected individual, because the point that has been made by both my hon. Friends is now emerging as a very real fear.<br><br>
If there were to be a situation where, say, the police were to take 200 names and addresses and there were no proceedings against anyone arising from that incident, that would be very undesirable. Equally, looking at it from the other point of view, if proceedings were to arise from that incident and someone were to find himself in court, and only two of the 200 people whose names and addresses had been noted were to appear as witnesses, clearly the other 198 would have serious cause for concern.<br><br>
I am sure that the Solicitor-General will not brush this lightly aside, because there are one or two other things that go on in normal routine police work that could be seriously damaged if people were to lose confidence in the system that will be introduced as a result of the Bill.<br><br>
I am thinking particularly of occasions when police stop a whole string of motorists. The constable usually says it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
a routine check and asks where one has been and where one is going and for one's name and address. He then asks for the car registration number, to prove that the driver knows the registration number of his own car. I was once with a driver who did not know the registration number of his own car. He was the managing director of a big company and had never washed his car in his life. He had a terrible job explaining to the police that it really was his car, which was a fairly expensive vehicle. That is the sort of thing which the Solicitor-General knows takes place at the moment in normal police routine work, often on a Friday or Saturday night and particularly in the Lothians and Borders, were the police are very vigilant. They put up a road block and stop every car and ask those questions. I hope that the Solicitor-General will give some reassurance also in that regard.<br><br>
My second and final point—I do not want to detain the Committee and not allow time for the Solicitor-General to reply—is that we still have serious trouble with acts of vandalism. In the Bill introduced by the Labour Government there was no intention to introduce a specific crime of vandalism. Much of the success in reducing acts of vandalism was due to a system introduced by chief constables throughout Scotland. It was instituted in the old Ayr borough police force by the then chief constable, Quintin Wilson. People reporting acts of vandalism did not have to give names and addresses. Indeed, the chief constables in many parts of Scotland went to a great deal of trouble preparing leaflets which were delivered to every household in their police area, advising people that if they saw an act of vandalism all they had to do was either call the police and tell them that that act was being committed or, if they could get hold of a policeman there and then, to advise the policeman that the act of vandalism was being committed. It was specific in the leaflet that there was no requirement on these people to give their names and addresses.<br><br>
We all recognised at that time that one of the most serious deterrents to people reporting acts of vandalism was the feeling that they might have to appear in court as a witness. It was amazing to see the results of that leaflet in places such as Ayr where the system was introduced.<br><br>
Clause 1 is related to every other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
clause in the Bill. Even the football crowd behaviour clauses will be related to clause 1 and the ability of the police to take the names and addresses of whole groups of people if they feel that they have something to offer in the sense of being a witness to an offence. In relation to the Government's proposal to introduce the specific crime of vandalism, I should like the Solicitor-General to clear up a point. For the last four or five years—or it could easily be seven or eight years—there has been a system operated by many of the police forces in Scotland, if not all of them, whereby they did not require people reporting acts of vandalism to give their names and addresses; indeed, they positively encouraged people to report acts of vandalism, but without requiring them to give their names and addresses and eventually appear in court as possible witnesses.<br><br>
The fears and doubts that have been expressed are very real. The Committee owes a debt to my two hon. Friends who have spoken in this debate, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) who moved the amendments, for bringing to the surface these lingering doubts that many people will have—doubts that are born not out of disrespect for the law but out of respect for it and the desire on the part of all of us to maintain that respect.<br><br>
Many hon. Members on each side feel that respect for the law is a two-way thing; it has to be cemented through co-operation between the police and the public and not through conflict. If there is anything in the Bill that will cause conflict between the police and the public, we have an obligation to examine it publicly and in great detail and, if possible, try to remove that area of conflict in order that police and public can co-operate in the very important job of dealing with crime.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to those who have spoken in the debate and raised certain matters of principle. I should like to begin a brief summing up by comparing the position of this clause with that of the previous one, which was mothered, fathered or begotten, if not made, by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). It was conceived and very nearly gestated, had it not been aborted.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
The position under the Labour Government's Criminal Justice Bill was this. First, before an amendment in my name was included, the constable had to obtain the name and address, it was "shall" not "may". We managed to change it. He had to verify that name and address; now he need not. He could detain the person until he had verified the name and address, and he could use force to detain him until he had verified it. It is a very restricted power that we propose, namely, that he may ask for a name and address. That to some extent answers the matter of vandalism that the hon. Member raised.<br><br>
Secondly, the constable cannot use force —a witness, after all, has not committed any crime—and, thirdly, he cannot detain him until verification. This seems to be a very much more reasonable and humane proposal than that to which those who were on the Committee of the previous Bill assented. I excuse the hon. Members for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who were not on the previous Bill. I am referring to those who have spoken here. I beg the pardon of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and the other hon. Members of the Committee who have spoken, but it does not lie in the mouth of those who assented to those much harder powers to criticise the now much modified powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. and learned Gentleman has been quite fair. He has been manifestly fair to some of my hon. Friends but has he been fair to others? There is a new situation; there is an overall push in this direction. There is the question of the circular from the Procurator-Fiscal and the question of the Employment Bill. There is the question now of names and possibly of compiling lists of witnesses. This clause in relation to the Employment Bill drastically alters the position and makes it possible for any hon. Member who attended that Bill to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal briefly with certain matters that arose? I thought, having excused the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), that he gave a very good illustration to the Committee of the necessity for this power, in that he was whitewashing or redwashing the pavement—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was legally whitewashing the road. It is perfectly legal in Glasgow. Unfortunately, cars came along and spoilt all my activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may have had an indulgence but in fact he was committing an offence, both statutory and in common law. We need not go into that; fortunately, he has no previous convictions in the matter. Nothing is more irritating in our everyday experience than to find some public person who will not give his name when one has a legitimate complaint. It is important that a person should give his name and address as a witness. The Thomson committee was unanimous on it, the civil liberties organisations were in support of it, and it is a perfectly reasonable and sensible power.<br><br>
It will be exercised—and here I answer what was said by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing)—with the discretion that all policeman are required to exercise. The spokesman for the Opposition in another place said that he considered that, if the law is made precise, the courts can interpret it precisely; they can contain the activities of the police within it. He also added that he trusted the police to exercise the power discreetly.<br><br>
It is obvious that, if it is against their interests in a case of vandalism, the police will not ask for somebody's name and address. I can give an assurance to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—, it has been such a quiet constituency for so long, I have difficulty in recalling it— that the police would only ask for the names, for instance, in a picket line or a football disturbance, of those who would be material witnesses to something which was believed to be an offence.<br><br>
The concept that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) put forward, that a person ought to be entitled to remain anonymous in such a situation, seems to me to be ill-founded. That does not seem to me to have any moral or legal foundation for it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point—that it would be only those who would be asked to give evidence whose names would be taken. Will the Solicitor-General be bringing forward an amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
on Report to secure that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, one could not make that the subject of an amendment. If the hon. Member cares to talk to any police officer in charge of the delicate question of industrial demonstrations, he will know that the police proceed with the greatest caution. To be provocative by asking 200 people for their names and addresses, when only two are required, just would not happen. This is a very simple power which all were agreed—until this debate—was necessary. Indeed, some Opposition Members agreed that something much more Draconian was necessary and legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Solicitor-General sits down, could he explain something which I am not clear about as a new member of the Committee? It is a genuine request. If someone gives a false name and address under this provision, since there is no verification now, as there was under the previous Bill, how will a prosecution be effected under paragraph 1(5)(<i>a</i>), because all the policeman has is a false name and address?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and there will be innumerable circumstances which will arise. Suppose that a passenger in a motor car gives a false name and address. Presumably, the other persons in the motor-car can then be asked who the passenger was.<br><br>
I do not think that it could possibly be said, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), says, that for people to be permitted either to say "I am not giving my name and address" or "I am going to give a wrong name and address", creates good relations between the public and the police. It is in the interests of all of us that a policeman should be able to obtain the name of a witness to an offence, so that the crime may be prosecuted. That seems to me to be sensible. We have relaxed the stringency of the powers under the previous Bill, and this is a sensible and moderate power which all are agreed should be regularised in the statute to make the law clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to be convinced by the Solicitor-General that it is moderate and reasonable, but I am not sure that he has yet convinced me that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
it is an effective power. Imagine that I am the old lady described by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), and that the policeman, reasonably, asks for my name and address. I do not want to be bothered with any court proceedings. Alternatively, perhaps I am a business man, and I am far too busy. Suppose that I say that my name is Nicholas Fairbairn, and that my address is Fordell Castle, Dunfermline—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will never believe that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be difficult to persuade the policeman of that particular one; but supposing I give a false name and address, and I am a perfectly respectable looking person and there is no reason to believe otherwise, and I go away. How can it be followed up? It does not seem to me to be in any way effective. Yet we seem to have lost the advantage of people giving their names and addresses voluntarily. We have introduced compulsion and we have introduced illegality, without any gain. If we are introducing compulsion and illegality into it—I am not saying I would have supported it—we might as well have done what the previous Government suggested, and made it effective. What we seem to have done is to make it illegal without making it effective. Would the Solicitor-General not agree?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not agree with that. If only I had the good looks of the hunchback of Notre Dame, perhaps the case the hon. Gentleman quoted might give rise to difficulty. If the public know and are told that there is a sanction for giving a false name and address, they will be much more cautious in doing so. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) should be very wary before he goes about giving the name and address he suggested and imagining that there will be no follow-up to it.<br><br>
One should remember, also, that the person who is giving a name and address in many circumstances may be known to the police, and therefore if he says "I am Mickey Mouse" when he is George Macdonald, immediately the policeman knows that he is giving false particulars. With respect, one may not change one's name by deed poll in Scotland.<br><br>
I do not think that there is anything else that I can say to the Committee. I think that I have answered all the points.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
I merely ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to one or two points which the Solicitor-General has not dealt with. First, what use will be made of the names recorded? Will they be erased from the record if no prosecution takes place, or if the people are not called as witnesses? I will not say 200, but if there is a situation where the names and addresses of 15 witnesses are taken and it is decided that only three of them are in a position to give reliable evidence, what happens to the other 12 names in those circumstances?<br><br>
The second point which I should like answered is this. There is still a detention power in the clause, in a sense. If someone whom the police know gives a false name and address, he can be detained until it is verified, even though he may be the twin brother of the person the police think he is. That person can still be detained on the street because, on suspicion of the police, he is committing an offence. Or if they wish to detain that person, for whatever reason—perhaps he is being a bit difficult—they could say "We suspect you of giving a false name. Would you therefore wait here until we verify it?"<br><br>
If the man says "No, I shall not wait because you do not have any power", the police are then in a position to arrest that person without warrant on suspicion, or to detain him on suspicion until such time as they have verified, because they think he has committed an offence.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Can I equally say on that point that presumably then, if the man still objects, the police could use reasonable force to detain him, even though he is merely a witness?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, in the instance the hon Member gives, the man has ceased to be a witness and has become a suspect.<br><br>
With regard to the names and addresses, they will remain in a policeman's notebook. Suppose that there is some notorious murder—some old woman is hacked to death in the east end of Glasgow—and the police question hundreds of people, write down their names and make door to door inquiries. They will say, "Were you out last night?"<br><br>
I remember that in the case of Walter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
Scott Ellis <i>v.</i> Walkinshaw there were about 3,000 witness statements. Those remain in the policeman's notebook and the notebook is eventually handed into the police station and kept for a period of time until it is thought it may never be needed again. There is nothing sinister about that. It happens under the law as at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite true in the case of a general criminal inquiry. We were raising a specific point, and that is what would then happen where one could see a purpose—if the Government continues to go along this road—in retaining the names of people on a picket line. If it were not so, people would certainly feel that it were so.<br><br>
We all know that the activities of the Special Branch have increased considerably over the years. Many people have good reason to worry about this kind of extension. The policing of the police becomes an important question. In that kind of situation, can any guarantees be given that it will be wiped out? One understands that in the general inquiries this is so, but in a specific case such as this it gives rise to a great deal of anxiety, which I share. Can the Solicitor-General give us any reassurance on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go on answering points indefinitely, but if a person is on a picket line, behaving within the law, and he gives his name and address, I cannot see anything wrong with that, any more than if he is at a football match and gives his name and address, if he is obeying the law. The hon. Gentleman seems to be frightened that anybody should know who is on a picket line, lest it be known who is there breaking the law. It is only those breaking the law that we are concerned with, not those carrying out their lawful duties. The hon. Gentleman must not imagine that because he is sensitive about the matter of somebody standing outside a factory gate in perfectly lawful circumstances, the whole law can be swung around in order to avoid his suspicions that he may be asked for his name and address in order to witness a criminal offence. I do not see what is wrong with that. I do not see why a person on a picket line should be any more exempt from being a witness than a person on any other line.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem with that is is that Conservative Members, unlike Opposition Members, are not accustomed to taking part in activities which we know are perfectly legal but which certain sections of the Establishment consider to be subversive. What worries us is that the ordinary constable who comes to the picket line may legitimately only wish to take the names and addresses of people who are pickets, but the Special Branch of that area may request from that constable those names for their clients. Do not think it does not happen, because Opposition Members know that it does.<br><br>
I happen to have an example of it. A friend of mine who worked with me in Hamilton College of Education one day had two Special Branch constables on his doorstep. He made the mistake of inviting</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 1, line 25, at end insert:—
<br><blockquote><p>"and provided that the requirement to remain with the constable shall cease to apply if there is unreasonable delay in obtaining such verification and the period of time that a person is required to remain for the purpose of verification shall not in any event exceed thirty minutes from the time the requirement is made."</p></blockquote>
The intention is clear. It is to ensure that where someone has been detained for the purpose of verifying his name and address, this should not be for an unreasonable time, and that in any event that time should not exceed 30 minutes from the time the requirement is made.<br><br>
There is something of a history to this. There was a debate on the equivalent clause under the Labour Government's Criminal Justice Bill. On that occasion the Conservatives, led by the present Solicitor-General, tried to take out the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"where such verification can speedily be obtained",</p></blockquote>
on the ground, I understand, not that they objected to it being done speedily, to be fair, but that they considered that these words were valueless and could not be defined. I can see the force of that argument. We are trying to define them in</span></p>

<p>them into his house. They then asked him a series of questions about a meeting he had attended with a particular person who was a friend of his. He was not of the political persuasion of his friend, but had gone purely as a friend and colleague to that meeting, yet it was on the Special Branch's file that he had attended. We are concerned about how some of these names, in terms of pickets and demonstrations, will be used and passed on to other sections of the police where they go on record for activities that are perfectly legal but which tend to be considered by certain people as being subversive.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 9.</p>
<p>terms of the 30-minute provision which has been added, and which, I hope, will overcome the Solicitor-General's objections which he made in the previous Bill.</p>
<p>The case that the Solicitor-General made was a good one. It can be found in the Committee proceedings on the previous Bill, where the right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We must remember that this is a constable with a man in a street. I cannot see a constable hanging around for hours with a man in a street, just wandering up and down throughout his shift while this process goes on, presumably through his walkie-talkie. The message goes to the station and they try to find out whether the chap really lives at 243 North East Street, New York. I think that very unlikely. It seems to me that a constable would want to get on with doing other things. He will not hang around with a chap whose address is in Valparaiso, and it takes a week to find out whether it is true."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; col. 46.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The Solicitor-General always likes an argument taken to absurd lengths. I do not think it is very likely that it will be a matter of an address in Valparaiso or in New York. It is very likely to be an address in a little housing scheme in one of our large cities. He draws attention very properly in that passage to the difficulties which will arise if people are held in the street while efforts are made to check the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
particular address.</p>
<p>As I say, my understanding is that, in trying to take out the provisions about its being done speedily, the Solicitor-General was worried that it did not have enough definition and teeth. Whether we have got it right in this particular amendment, we have made a serious attempt to get over that particular difficulty.</p>
<p>Perhaps I may at this point raise a matter of real substance about the definition and the Government's intentions under the clause. If someone is detained for verification in terms of clause 1, I wish to have the Solicitor-General's comments on whether "remain with him", which is the phrase in the statute, means remain at the locus or possibly in the police car beside the locus where he has been stopped, or whether it would be possible to move that person down to the police station while verification takes place. This matter was raised by me in Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), who was on the Front Bench said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My advice is that the person would be held at the place where he or she is stopped and would not be transferred to a police station. It would be ridiculous to transport witnesses to a police station in order to check names and addresses. I keep emphasising the point about witnesses, because they are just as much a party to what we are discussing as the suspected person. We must keep that uppermost in our minds."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; col. 50.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>It may be that I am knocking at an open door here and that the Solicitor-General will hasten to say that he agrees with the statement which was made from the Labour Front Bench that it would be utterly ridiculous to contemplate moving someone to a police station while the name and address is being checked. The context is a little different, because we are now talking about suspects as well as witnesses, while that statement came specifically in the discussion about witnesses.</p>
<p>The point is one of some substance, as I am sure that the Solicitor-General will agree. If it is clear—as I hope he will underline—that there is no question of taking someone to a police station to verify, it seems to me that we have the situation which he described in Committee of someone hanging around with a policeman at the locus while this verification process takes place.</p>
<p>In those circumstances, it seems to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
doubly important that there should be a very distinct time limit on how long this verification process might take. That is why we have come up with the 30-minute suggestion.</p>
<p>There is, of course, plenty of evidence from Thomson. I suppose that the Thomson report is now something of a good book. There is plenty of evidence from Thomson that it expected verification to be done very speedily indeed, and with an absolute minimum of delay. The Committee may find a summary of this on page 277, paragraph 8:
<br><blockquote><p>"No person should be detained elsewhere than in a police station for longer than is necessary for the following purposes."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>One of these is
<br><blockquote><p>"taking name and address of detainee and, where it can be done rapidly, for example, by radio, verifying these."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The whole spirit of Thomson is that it should be done fast, and hence again the appearance of the 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I appreciate the argument, I am sure that the Solicitor-General will use it, as he is entitled to do, that to put in an arbitrary limit of 30 minutes is to remove flexibility and to commit the police in a way which is not wicked but just plain impractical. I suspect that that is what we shall be told. He will not be surprised that I shall now call in aid the Law Society. It is its main memorandum which suggests this amendment. I did not take it actually verbatim from the Law Society, because I drafted it before I discovered that it was supporting it, but I am consoled in my position by its support. The amendment largely runs on the lines which it suggests on page 3 in paragraph 22 of the report.</p>
<p>I do not suggest for a moment that there is anything sacred in the recommendation of the Law Society. It is not in my eyes some sort of "Good Housekeeping" seal of approval which should automatically be endorsed by the Committee; but the support of the Law Society, for the clause, as the Solicitor-General will appreciate is a specific recommendation for improvement from a body of substance, which is generally sympathetic to his case, at least on the clause. I hope that that will protect me from any attack of frivolity or humbuggery, or anything else, on the clause. It is worth pursuing, and I shall listen with interest to what the Solicitor-General has to say.</p>

<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). Earlier, in the previous debate, I made an intervention in the Solicitor-General's reply, which indicated that I have grave doubts about the efficacy of getting names and addresses from people who are not co-operating. I particularly wish to ask the Solicitor-General if, during the course of the debate, he can clarify some points with regard to this aspect of it. I accept that there is a problem and, as I said earlier, I am not unsympathetic to the need to gather names and addresses of witnesses.<br><br>
I say this as someone who has served for a few years on the bench in a burgh court and subsequently a district court. I have seen the difficulty that the police have in proving cases and in putting forward evidence. On a number of occasions in the burgh court I have had to say that someone is not guilty because there is no evidence to prove that person guilty, and in my heart of hearts I have known, so far as one can ever know, that the person has been guilty.<br><br>
I can see the difficulty that the police have in bringing forward evidence, in getting the witnesses there, getting their names and addresses and their willingness to participate, and I can see that there is always the temptation for policemen to strengthen evidence to try to strengthen the case. I can understand the temptation. I am not asking these questions in any way to be negative but to try to be helpful. It seems to me that the verification of names and addresses is, in certain circumstances, relatively easy, because there are certain people in certain walks of life who can produce, immediately, evidence which might be taken. I should like the Solicitor-General to confirm that this kind of thing would be taken as verification of names and addresses—such things as driving licences and other documentation of an official nature, which bear the name and address of the person concerned, or the name and address which he has given. If that is adequate, that clears up the situation for a whole range of people. There are certain people who have driving licences, and other documents, credit cards and so on, and who normally carry them. There are other people who do not. There are people who seldom or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
never carry this kind of documentation.<br><br>
My understanding of the position is that the only way to verify the name and address is for a call to be made to the address of the person given, either by telephone or, preferably, in the person of a constable visiting the house. I know of instances, in cases where I have been on the bench, where this has happened, where the constable has gone to the house concerned. It is important to realise that in many cases there may be no one at home at that particular address, and this has arisen. On the one hand, this could create difficulties in the case of the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend, which I support, in that in 30 minutes it is difficult to visit a locus, to ascertain whether someone lives there and to get back to the person concerned. On the other hand, to expect someone to hang around, when a number of visits are paid, until someone is found at that locus—for instance, if there are children at school and a working mother, there may be no one in for a whole day— is unreasonable. Yet there may be no other way to verify the name and address of the person concerned.<br><br>
Also, when the house is visited, I should like the Solicitor-General to indicate to us what kind of question is asked. It would be quite possible for a person in that street to give the name and address of someone they know perfectly well just a few doors down, and to say "I am Harry Smith, 109 Parkhead Drive, Edinburgh", knowing that that is a real person. When the constable goes along and asks whether there is someone there called Harry Smith of that address, the wife says "Yes". If it is indicated to her that her husband has been detained, and it is not the person, that causes a great deal of anxiety, and the information which she gives—that he does in fact live at that address—could be quite worthless if the person is giving the wrong address deliberately and falsely.<br><br>
It also limits the ability to verify addresses to a particular radius. If I were in any way criminally inclined, the effect of this would be to make sure that I was not in the locus anywhere near where I lived when I was committing crimes, so even if I give a name and address it would be very difficult to verify them.<br><br>
It raises the question of people who live in lodging houses. This has arisen in cases with which I have been involved— perfectly respectable, honourable, law-abiding people who for good reason, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
for perhaps no fault of their own, have to live in lodging houses. We have repeatedly had problems in court of whether a lodging house is a proper address and is accepted as an address—if I say that my name is Harry Smith of such and such an address in the Grassmarket, whether this is accepted as a name and address and whether I am then released, if I am a suspect, or whether I continue to be held until some better address, some more permanent address in the mind of the constable is obtained.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will be able to answer some of these questions, because this is a very difficult clause. The verification of names and addresses can be difficult in circumstances. There is a whole group of people who could be detained unnecessarily and lengthily as a result. On the basis that anyone, whether taken in as a suspect or not, is innocent until the due process of law—of which the Solicitor-General and other members of the Committee are an integral part in their other presences—proves him guilty, the Solicitor-General and other Members on the Government side must recognise that many people who are apprehended are innocent, and are subsequently proved to be genuinely innocent.<br><br>
We must ensure that these people are not detained at great length when they are going about their lawful business, when they have broken no laws whatever but are merely, for some reason or other, under suspicion. Because there are so many doubts about the verification of names and addresses, some of which I have given, I would support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden to say that there are people who would be unduly delayed—improperly delayed, in my view—as a result. If the Solicitor-General feels that he cannot answer some of the points raised by my hon. Friend and myself, I hope he will be willing to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene in the debate and I shall not speak at great length. I feel that there are one or two things that I should like to say.<br><br>
First, I could, like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) recount something from experience, but the experience he had related to the Korean war some time ago. The experience I had relates to this morning, when I travelled to the House of Commons
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
from Scotland in the company of my wife, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), and Mrs. Jean Buchan, the distinguished Member of the European Parliament, from Glasgow. When we reached the House of Commons, circumstances arose concerning the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden which, had this Bill been in force—if it ever becomes law—in England and Wales and certainly within this Metropolitan authority, would have placed him in very serious difficulty. When we arrived at the door of the House—that is the entrance from Westminster tube station—our passes were demanded of us. My wife produced her pass and I was able to produce my identification, but the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden was unable to do so. Therefore he fell within the definition of clause 1(1) (<i>a</i>) of the Bill. Indeed, a constable, believing that he was a person acting suspiciously, could have taken the hon. Member away and placed him in the Tower. Had he done that, there would have been terrible lamentations throughout Scotland and, indeed, despair in Drumchapel. I am pleased to say that I was able to impress upon the police officers that the services of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden were needed here today in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to intervene when the hon. Gentleman is speaking, but I should make clear, in case there is some misunderstanding arising from his comments, that no policeman can prevent a Member of Parliament from entering the precincts of the Palace of Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He was 6 ft. 6 in. tall—a very large policeman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There were some very large policemen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member would recognise that the majority of Members of the House in the precincts this morning were required to produce identity cards. This was designed, I understand it, to check that the security operations were being effective. I am delighted to see that and hope that the police in Scotland are as effective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of going through that long story was to say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
the Bill as it stands is unacceptable to Opposition Members because it lacks definition. As I understand what happened in the Committee previously, the argument that was offered by the now Solicitor-General at that time was that words in the Bill were unhelpful because they lacked definition. My. hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden has sought, in moving the amendment, to give clear definition to the Bill. I shall be very surprised if the Government are not eager to accept it, because it is very important that the rights and the protection of people are treated with equal importance to the need to give the police sufficient power to go about their duties.<br><br>
Conservative Members have a lot to say about police powers but little to say about people's freedom. I am concerned about that. As we proceed through the Bill line by line, it is becoming more and more evident.<br><br>
I am hopeful that when the Solicitor-General rises to reply he will say something about the Law Society of Scotland, which has declared itself in categorical terms. It describes the amendment as being of an abiding nature for the protection of suspects or potential witnesses.<br><br>
As I have said before in the Committee, there is a strong case for having regard to the views of learned societies and balancing them against that which we believe to be in the interests of maintaining the right balance between police powers and the freedom of the individual.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Having regard to what has been argued before in this Committee, the amendment gives very clear definition, and it would greatly improve the clause and would be widely welcomed by all the parties—that is, the police and the courts—if the clause were to be adopted.<br><br>
I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, about police officers, and my information —and that of all members of the Committee—has been added to by the clarity of what you said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is a further attempt to refine this section of the Bill. Before the Solicitor-General replies to the debate, we should paint the picture just a bit broader than hitherto has been the case. As the Solicitor-General will remember, this is the section of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
Labour Government's Bill in which the Solicitor-General, then the Opposition spokesman, moved an amendment which took out the word "shall" and inserted the word "may". That amendment was carried by six votes to four. The Solicitor-General rightly claimed, in my view now, that that provided the constable with a great deal more flexibility than the original wording of the original Bill.<br><br>
Having said that, it must also be borne in mind during this debate that we are not now debating the principle whether we agree that someone should be required to give his name and address. We are debating the situation where the name and address has been asked for and given, and we are seeking, through the amendment— and I give notice now that I will support it —to define the rights of both the constable and the person whose name and address has been asked for. That is in the interests of the Solicitor-General, it is in the interests of the police officer at the scene of any suspected offence, and it is also in the interests of the person if we can write this into the statute, as the Solicitor-General was keen to do in the Labour Government's Bill. The Committee supported him then in his desire to introduce flexibility into the Bill.<br><br>
If the amendment were to be carried, we would be in a position which should be attractive to the Solicitor-General because, first, the flexibility that the constable has in the clause that has been introduced by the Solicitor-General in the present Government's Bill would mean that he would have to decide whether he was going to ask for a name and address. That is the first piece of flexibility that the constable has. Secondly, once he has made that decision to ask for a name and address, he then has a further decision to make as to whether he is to verify it. So, if he decides to verify the name and address, then and then only would this particular amendment come into play, because obviously in the other two situations I have posed the amendment would not come into play. If the constable decided not to ask for a name and address, the amendment would not be relevant to the situation and, secondly, if the constable decided not to verify the name and address, the amendment would not be relevant to the situation either.<br><br>
Where a constable says to a person "I think I had better check that name and address", it is reasonable from both the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
constable's point of view and the person's point of view to define the circumstances, the situation, that would then prevail. The amendment does not seek to undermine anybody and it does not seek to make it more difficult for the constable to do his job. It does not seek to do any of these things, and that is what makes it so attractive. It only seeks, in the third of the three situations which I have presented to the Solicitor-General, to define the position of the constable and define the position of the person.<br><br>
It may well be that in reply the Solicitor-General will say that the drafting of the amendment is defective, that it is impracticable, or that there is a whole host of reasons why the Government do not want to accept it. All I would say to the Solicitor-General is that, if the will is there on the part of the Government somehow or other to define the position of the person whose name and address has been asked for, and of the constable, in the third of these three situations which I have painted for the Solicitor-General, it ought not to be beyond the ability of the Government's draftsmen to come up with a form of words which would at least meet the points made by my hon. Friends in this debate.<br><br>
We can all draw on personal experiences. Once I lived in a house at 16 Robertson Avenue. I remember a policeman coming to my door at about 1 o'clock in the morning. When I opened the door he said to me, "Does Elizabeth Taylor live here?" I could not believe my luck, nor could I convince the police officer that Elizabeth Taylor did not live there. He even said, "Could I come in and check that?" I said, "No, you can't come in."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Member have a luncheon voucher?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks whether I had a luncheon voucher. When I have a luncheon voucher I prefer to spend it on steak and onions rather than on the forbidden fruit. Those who want to spend their luncheon vouchers on forbidden fruit are free to do so, but to me steak and onions have always been much more appetising.<br><br>
Unknown to me, Mr. Gourlay—like yourself I am away from home a great deal—there is an Elizabeth Taylor who lives not far from me. She lives in No. 60, and the police officer had merely mistaken
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
16 for 60. I had a terrible job convincing him that Elizabeth Taylor did not live at 16.<br><br>
These are light-hearted incidents which we can all relate as we go through the Bill. Nevertheless, behind all these light-hearted incidents is a serious content. In this case, the serious content is undoubtedly in the third of the three situations which I have presented to the Solicitor-General. In two of the situations the amendment would not operate in any case, and my hon. Friends and myself accept that. It is only in the third situation, where the constable asks for the address and decides to check it, that the amendment would operate. I hope that, with the Solicitor-General's co-operation, we could come up with a form of words that would define the position of the person whose name and address has been asked for and the police constable in that situation.<br><br>
That would be only an extension of the approach taken by the Solicitor-General himself when we were discussing this aspect of the Bill, when the Bill was going through under a Labour Government.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will not come back and say, "This never occurred to us," and so on. That is absolutely true, and there is no denying it. If the Solicitor-General wants to make that the burden of his argument, so be it, but it is not a valid argument in regard to a failure on the part of the Government, helped by us—a failure on all our parts— to try to define the position of these two people at that important time, when a constable has asked for a name and address, and when he has made the other decision that he has the power to make under the clause to verify that name and address. I hope that the Solicitor-General will be helpful on this and will, if he cannot accept the amendment, give us an undertaking that he would come back on Report with a form of words which would define the position of those two people at that particular time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I have no doubt that he is easily confused with Richard Burton—certainly in the extremities of the latter's behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was Michael Wilding at the time.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a confusion, with respect, Mr. Gourlay, which even the blindest drunk person could not make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may have been Richard Todd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first advise hon. Members what the Bill says? It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The constable may require the person mentioned … to remain with him while he … verifies any name and address."</p></blockquote>
Then there is this proviso:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the constable shall exercise his power … only where it appears to him that such verification can be obtained quickly."</p></blockquote>
It would go on:
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the requirement to remain with the constable shall cease to apply if there is unreasonable delay"—</p></blockquote>
which is contrary to "quickly"—
<br><blockquote><p>"in obtaining such verification".</p></blockquote>
Who is to decide that it has ceased to apply? It is rather vague. It would continue:
<br><blockquote><p>"and the period of time that a person is required to remain for the purpose … shall not in any event exceed thirty minutes from the time the requirement is made."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate what the Law Society has said and I appreciate that great minds think alike, but just as the great mind of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) who, the story of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) reminded us, is not only brained but scatterbrained, sometimes changes its view, so does the Law Society. The Law Society gave evidence to the Thomson Committee and the purport of that evidence and the conclusion which was drawn from it appears at paragraph 3.18, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We decided, however, that a rigid time-limit was not desirable where such short periods of time were concerned, and that it would be sufficient to provide that no person should be detained elsewhere than in a police station for longer than is necessary for the following purposes."</p></blockquote>
"As quickly as possible" or "to obtain quickly" is a restriction even on that point of view.<br><br>
A very large number of people in fact, most people, although not all have on them at almost any time some letter, document, bill or card of some kind. Of course, there are people who do not. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
constable would have to ask himself whether, in the circumstances, he could verify the name and address sensibly. He might be able to do it by radio. It might require a visit to somebody's house or something of that kind. People do give false names or the name of a neighbour, but I would have thought a constable would not go to the door and say "Does Elizabeth Taylor live here?" I would have thought that he would take Elizabeth Taylor with him and say "Is this your wife?" or whatever, if the address is near at hand and he can go there quickly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden is concerned whether the constable will remain in the same place. I do not consider that in all circumstances he would remain in the same place. It would seem to me sensible, if one saw someone coming out of a pub and suspected that he had been responsible for some offence and he told you who he was, to take him back to the pub to see whether that could be verified. If that had been done in the case of Joseph Boyle he would not have been sentenced to 10 years for attempted murder an offence which he did not commit.<br><br>
It would seem to me perfectly reasonable that a constable should be in a position to verify by taking somebody to another location, provided it can be done quickly, in order to ask "Is that so?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now getting on to very dangerous ground. I must get this clear. Is the Solicitor-General now saying—as distinct from the advice that the Labour Government received on this point—that the new Government have got different advice, that the position has now changed, and that where a person has been asked for his name and address the constable is not required to keep him in that place where he has been asked for his name and address? I gather from what the Solicitor-General said that the constable is now free to take the person to any place which he considers would help to verify the person's name and address. If that is the position, that is a very major change since we last considered this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had any advice on the matter. All I am saying to the hon. Gentleman is that it seems to me that there may be circumstances in which the intelligent and fastest way to verify a name and address would be to take that person to the place from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
which he says he has just come in order to verify the name and address. After all, we are considering circumstances in which the constable is alone with the person.<br><br>
Let us take the example I have just given. One hundred yards from the "Wee Man" public house the constable comes up to this person. He has been called to the scene because there has been a disturbance of some kind and he believes this person answers the description and he therefore suspects him. He asks him for his name and address; the man has no identification on him and he says that he is so-and-so. He has a choice. If he has to remain rooted to that spot he has to radio for assistance, and then what does he do? Another policeman cannot go to the pub and say "Would you mind coming out here and saying whether this is or is not Harry Smith?" He cannot take Harry Smith to the pub, so what can he do?<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I should have thought that it would be sensible for a constable to use his discretion. The requirement of the Bill is that the person remains with the constable. It does not say that they have to be nailed through the feet to the very place where arrest occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, because it is a clear departure from the advice that the Committee was given at the last sitting. The trigger phrase is "to remain with him". If the constable says "Here we are in the centre of Glasgow, you say that you come from a certain street on a peripheral housing scheme five miles way", is the Solicitor-General suggesting that he can require that person to enter a police car to be taken to that address to be checked; or perhaps—this is a little more worrying—can he say to him "You get into this police car and we will take you along to Baird Street police station where we will detain you while we do the checking"?<br><br>
In that situation, clearly, the checking can be leisurely because it is not inconvenient. The safeguard which I thought the Solicitor-General was going to rely on— and I have some sneaking sympathy with it—is that we do not need to worry about abuse here because they all have to stay at the spot while the checking goes on, and it is going to be very inconvenient for the policeman if he starts abusing it. But if he can take the person concerned back to a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
police station and dump him, the checking might take many hours. In that situation, if that is possible, the matter of a time limit becomes very serious and the need for a time limit becomes a very serious point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has no power to take him to a police station and dump him because he has to remain with him and, obviously, with the proviso that he has to make the verification quickly, the question of taking him on long journeys in order to verify is out of the question. Most people will be able to satisfy the verification on the spot, and it will be a matter for those concerned to exercise their sensible discretion.<br><br>
The argument which may appeal to the Opposition Members is that if we anticipate and we make the time 30 minutes, the ordinary constable will say to himself, "I have got this chap for half an hour," and that could become a norm that would not appear to be objectionable; whereas, if I were a police constable and knew I could only require a person to remain with me if the verification could be obtained quickly, I would have thought half an hour was far too long. Therefore, it would have the reverse effect in these cases.<br><br>
Obviously, there are going to be many different circumstances. A question of discovering quickly who somebody is if he is in the centre of Glasgow may be very different from being in the open countryside with a constable who may not even have a radio with him. It is a matter upon which one could not put limits and it would be unrealistic to do so. But suppose that we make half an hour the time for detaining a suspect, and take the case of Costello again. Costello might not have stolen the coal in those circumstances and might have just had brown paper in the parcel, as he said. Therefore, to detain somebody who is innocent for half an hour seems to me a very long time. I would much rather that it remained flexible. I am quite certain that in the circumstances of each individual situation the proviso will be an absolute protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find this a little difficult, because I am not totally unsympathetic to the argument about building in inflexibility. This is an area of the Bill where in the last Committee stage we came and went quite a bit. The Solicitor-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
General will remember that the word "shall" became "may" with the assistance of my vote joined with his. I welcome the fact that an attempt was made in the last Committee to take out any reference to speed. The words "where verification can speedily be obtained" were to be deleted if the then Opposition had had their way. At least, I suppose that I should be grateful that a similar phrase is in the Bill with the Solicitor-General's blessing.<br><br>
However, I confess that I am a little worried about the business of remaining with the constable. It complicates matters. I accept in a sense that the artificiality of keeping a person at the spot, the locus, had difficulties but, as I tried to indicate in my intervention, it had built in a very great safeguard that I do not think that there will be any great danger of abuse if there was that limitation. That limitation was emphatically endorsed by the then Government Front Bench. The phrase used, as I quoted earlier, was:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would be ridiculous to transport witnesses to a police station."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; col. 51.]</p></blockquote>
That was very firm guidance which I am sure was the result of consultation and not just off the cuff. If we are to depart from that, it seems to me that there are real dangers of having no time limit. If the Solicitor-General had even made a non-binding assurance that he would be prepared to look at the time limit again, I should have suggested to my hon. Friends that we do not divide the Committee on this. But if he cannot make any gesture of that kind to look at it again, I think that we should divide the Committee on the lines that the Law Society has suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to a Division, might I say to my hon. Friends and to hon. Gentlemen that there are times in Committee when we have to pass amendments to make a Government do something that they ought to do in any case. I take issue with the Solicitor-General over the wording which says "shall not exceed 30 minutes", which means from one to 30 minutes. I take the point also that it could easily become the norm. But I do not think there is any doubt in the Committee that something ought to be written into the Bill to cover the kind of situation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
that my hon. Friends and I have posed to the Committee. If this amendment being passed were to make the Government come back on Report and do something about it, we would have served the purpose for which we are here.<br><br>
On that basis, I advise my hon. Friends to put this amendment to a Division and to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one brief point. I disagree with the Solicitor-General when he says that most people carry some form of identification and therefore in most cases it can be readily proved.<br><br>
I accept that the Solicitor-General is an extremely smartly if somewhat unusually dressed man who perhaps is never seen outside his house without a suit and without a wallet which carries some form of identification. But I go out at weekends in a sweater and I do not carry identification because I hate putting a driving licence or a cheque book or my banker's card into the back pocket of my trousers because of the danger of losing them from the back pocket.<br><br>
I know that in the areas of the big peripheral housing schemes in Glasgow there are large numbers of young people who very rarely, if ever, receive letters, who certainly do not have driving licences, who do not have bank cards or cheque books and who would not normally have any form of identification on them. These are exactly the sorts of people we are gravely concerned about being held and detained by the police for excessive periods while verification takes place. I would have to disagree with the Solicitor-General on the issue that large numbers of ordinary working people do not carry identification with them as a regular feature of their lives.<br><br>
What worries me is that perhaps an extension of this is that, once one starts to introduce this sort of law in terms of detainees and witnesses, the only way in which the public can be protected—and this may be an argument which may come later from the police after this becomes a statute—is that everybody must carry an identity card to prove who he is. That would make the police's job of identification very much easier, and we have heard that sort of suggestion put from the police forces.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 9, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(and also that the person is under no obligation to answer any question or give any statement other than to give his name and address)".</p></blockquote>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
This is not an amendment which deals with the principle of clause 1. It is an amendment, as I said earlier, on the last series of amendments, which seeks again to define in the Bill the statutory rights of the person involved when the police officer asks for names and addresses.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear what the Solicitor-General says and whether he is minded to reject the amendment, although I hope that, as this is the last amendment to clause 1 and a necessary amendment, he will be minded to accept it.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General will remember that on the debate on amendment No. 9 on which we have just voted, there was considerable concern expressed by the Opposition about the right of the constable written into the legislation—and not written into the previous legislation— where it says in clause 1 (2) (<i>b</i>).
<br><blockquote><p>"notes any explanation proffered by the person".</p></blockquote>
There was a considerable debate about this and we were all worried about the</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 8.</p>
<p>standing of the statements that are to be noted by the constable, having been proffered by the person whom the constable was interviewing. While the Solicitor-General may have the feeling that it resolves any worries or doubts that I had in my mind, I am still deeply concerned about the standing of these statements.</p>
<p>I can see in court cases in future great debates about the admissibility in evidence of such statements as are now envisaged when the Solicitor-General is sitting as a judge in the Court of Session, as Lord Fairbairn, with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) perhaps defending one of his clients, as is his wont, and pleading that his client did not do it and that the statements that were made to the police were made because the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South's client did not know that he was only under a requirement to give his name and address and to make no other statement. I can easily hear the words of the Solicitor-General as a future High Court judge in Scotland being quoted to the jury by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South. We can all imagine the scene in the High Court when the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, after he loses the redistributed seat that he has at present and returns to court work. It will be very embarrassing for the then Lord Fairbairn, presiding over a High Court, to persuade the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, the defence advocate, that he really
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
did not mean what he said during the Committee proceedings of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, 1980 as it will be then. The Opposition are trying to save the Solicitor-General from himself in the years that lie ahead.</p>
<p>We feel that one of the ways to help save the Solicitor-General from himself in the years ahead is to write into the Bill the words that are contained in amendment No. 12. If these reasons are not persuasive enough for the Solicitor-General, clearly there are very many other good reasons why those words should be incorporated in the legislation so that people are in no doubt.</p>
<p>I think we all agree that one of the reasons why this legislation has seen the light of day is because there are so many situations in Scotland where an accused or suspected person does not know his rights. This is one of the main reasons why it saw the light of day in the first place. If we are here to try to resolve that position and make clear to both the accused persons on the one hand what their rights are and to the police forces on the other how far they can go and no further, surely it is much better that we are more specific than this particular clause appears to be in relation to a person suspected of an offence.</p>
<p>Clearly, as the Solicitor-General will appreciate, the amendment applies to the subsection of the clause which deals only with those people who are suspected of an offence and does not deal with those whose names and addresses the police want to know as potential witnesses. It deals only with people who are suspected of committing an offence.</p>
<p>I can see no reason why we ought not to write this in. It would improve the Bill. I know that the Solicitor-General is a great champion of saving words. I remember him saying that on the previous Bill. Nevertheless, there are times when we should use more words in order to make the statute that bit clearer.</p>
<p>May I call in aid what the Government are doing on clause 2 without straying out of order, Mr. Gourlay? The Government have tabled seven or eight amendments on clause 2, to be much more specific. They define the rights of an individual. All we say is that that principle should be extended to this clause, without dealing with the principle of the clause and without doing anything to water the clause down or to write in reservations. All we say is that this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
should be written in in order to define the position of someone who is suspected of an offence. This does not deal with witnesses; this deals with people who are suspected of having committed an offence.</p>
<p>I regret having to say this, but I hope that some of the advocates on the Government side, who were appointed to the Committee to take part in our proceedings, will say something on this amendment. They have courtroom experience which they can bring to the Committee, which so far they have failed to bring. People outside are noticing that of the six advocates whom we have on the Committee, only one has so far spoken, and that is the Solicitor-General. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has also spoken but his contribution was so insignificant that it went over my head. Nevertheless, people are beginning to wonder why the six advocates were appointed to the Committee in the first place. The original view that these six advocates were here to help us make good law is now seriously suspect. We now have the view that they are here merely to make up the numbers and to vote according to "Mr. Whippy", the Government Whip— to vote according to the way in which they are told to vote.</p>
<p>I hope that the Solicitor-General will be a bit more co-operative, a bit more forthcoming, and will accept the amendment, because it would do a great deal to define the statute in relation to those people who are suspected of having committed an offence.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) ruins his argument by always descending, at the end of his argument, to abusing the other side of the Committee. But in this case I find it quite refreshing, because for once his arguments have been well worth listening to, except for his argument on this amendment. He says that this amendment will clarify the position concerning the person who is being stopped by the police. To my mind, it does exactly the opposite. It confuses the situation. When one reads the words it is neither fish nor fowl. It pretends to be a caution. It sets out, in the initial words of a caution, that one is not required to answer any question or to make any statement, but it fails to have the second part, that if one does make a statement it will be written down and may be used in evidence against one. Therefore, in effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
it actually says nothing, but it is more dangerous than that, because it gives the impression that this actually clarifies the position of any statement that is made concerning any subsequent court case.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear whether the Solicitor-General confirms this, but it is certainly my view that the effect of the amendment, were it to become law, would be to have no effect on the existing law relating to the admissibility of evidence at a subsequent trial. So all the discussions and submissions that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth is trying to save me from—if and when I appear to defend people again in the High Court— he is failing to achieve.<br><br>
It is very dangerous to put in words of this sort, which really are extraneous and irrelevant, and which may give a person the idea that it gives a special value or position to any statement he makes, whereas at the end of the day, when he arrives in the court, he finds that the position is still open and that the laws and rules of evidence still apply as they always have done in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member, if I understand the gravamen of his argument, believes that a warning should be added. Would he therefore agree with the words of the then Solicitor-General on the previous Labour Government's Bill, when he said that it was important that a warning should be given that no explanation need be given? The Solicitor-General has in fact argued the case for an addition to our amendment here—to add the warning. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That power already exists in the hands of the police. When they feel that a situation has arrived where there is sufficient ground for suspicion to have centred and eventually for an arrest to be made, then a policeman cautions a suspect. That power already exists.<br><br>
What the amendment is doing is to try to create a hybrid caution, which to my mind has absolutely no value, at an earlier stage. As I said to the Committee, and say again, this actually misleads. It certainly would mislead the person, and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth is, I believe, sincerely trying to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with some interest to what the hon. Member for Edinburgh,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
South (Mr. Ancram), had to say. I intend to return in a few minutes to his contribution to an earlier debate in this particular area. Even if I accepted, as I do not entirely, his strictures about the amendment's not protecting the likely admissibility or otherwise of evidence, and even if he were right that this were a sort of hybrid proposition put before the Committee, there is some virtue in it even at that level. We have a situation here in which a person who is, after all, being asked to give an explanation by the police because he is suspected of having committed an offence, is told a number of things. He is told, if I remember rightly, about the general nature of the offence which it is suspected the person has committed or is committing, but he is not told anything further. In that situation, if the police have him, if he knows that he is an object of suspicion, and if he is told why he is an object of suspicion and is asked for an explanation, he may then be under the misapprehension that he must give a reply.<br><br>
It seems to me that there is value in terms of telling a person what his rights are. The police should then go on, in simple lay language, to say, "But you have to understand that you do not need to say anything unless you want to do so".<br><br>
If that is not added, they may get replies which are on a basis of misapprehension as to the person's rights. That is not something which should be written into the law.<br><br>
Leaving aside the highly technical arguments about admissibility and so on, to which we may want to come in a minute or two, it seems to me, just in general terms of informing people of what is happening to them—what the police powers are under the statute, what are the obligations of someone who is the object of police activity authorised by this statute, and what his rights are—that that amendment should be written into the Bill so that there is no misapprehension on the part of anyone who is an object of suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this is a caution without the caution? This seems to be the danger of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am taking this at two levels, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) will appreciate the two levels. At the first, I am saying that it can be justified in the way in which I have outlined, as an attempt to tell people what their rights are in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
situation where very likely 999 out of 1,000 of them will not know what their rights are. The law has a duty to try to explain to someone where he stands, and ensure that he is under no misapprehension before he commits himself, perhaps fatally, in reply to this request for an explanation of the circumstances which have given rise to the constable's suspicion.<br><br>
Frankly, I would want my amendment to stand, and the Committee to include it in the Bill as it is. Conceivably, however, it could be improved, and we ought to address ourselves to the interesting argument that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, has advised—that is, that it is defective, that it does not go far enough. That is a proposition to which I prepared to turn my mind.<br><br>
If, for example, the Solicitor-General echoes this view, and says—I am probably being over-optimistic, because, after all, we are in the world of the attraction of opposites, and the fact that he has argued strongly for an amendment like this in the previous Committee stage does not hold out much hope for his good offices on this occasion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be accurate, I did not argue in favour of any such amendment in the last Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the Solicitor-General that we shall come to the text, no doubt in a moment. We have all been reading his speeches with interest.<br><br>
In any event, if the Solicitor-General is prepared to take the line that he would support the clause if it were toughened up by the addition of the normal second half of the caution, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, said, to the effect that if the suspect says something it may be taken down and used in evidence against him, then I would be prepared to look at that, but it is perfectly fair at the moment to have it on the information basis. That is my first submission.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
On the admissibility point—as this is important, we ought to turn our minds to it—I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that this is a matter of fundamental importance, and we ought to be clear before we vote exactly what the status of any explanation offered will be.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
We have had a number of competing pieces of advice already before the Committee. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, at the second sitting of the Committee—it seems like the twenty-second at the moment but it was only the second—said:
<br><blockquote><p>"once suspicion has centred—and the clause actually talks about suspicion—and before a caution is given, the evidence would in all likelihood, unless it was spontaneous, be inadmissible under the normal rules of evidence."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall be interested to hear what the Solicitor-General has to say on that point."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April 1980; col. 83.]</p></blockquote>
Those were famous last words, because there erupted from the Solicitor-General what was meant to be a magisterial rebuke but which turned out to be a slightly undignified bicker between the learned Gentlemen about the law of Scotland.<br><br>
In any event, we had from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South the suggestion that where suspicion has centred on an individual—and he is totally right in saying that by definition that is the situation we are dealing with, because that is the trigger part of the clause— the only sort of evidence that would be admissible would be that which was blurted out spontaneously, a flow of consciousness, one might say, and the fact that it was the result of a specific demand for an explanation, perhaps repeated but by definition a specific demand, would almost certainly mean that it was inadmissible.<br><br>
I would like, in terms of the arguments that we are to come to in clause 2 of the Bill, to go along with that as the law of Scotland, but that seems to be harking back to a rather rigid view of the doctrine of Chalmers which has long been departed from by the Scottish courts. I use only one piece of evidence for that. I have the case here because I know it will come up again in clause 2. I refer to Hartley v. Her Majesty's Advocate, which I have been studying with eager interest, having heard it so often on the lips of members of the Committee.<br><br>
In Lord Avonside's leading judgment in Hartley v. Her Majesty's Advocate, we find the following. First, he quotes Browden v. Her Majesty's Advocate and Lord Justice-General Clyde who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the test in all of them is the simple and intelligible test which has worked well in practice—has what has taken place been fair or not?"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
Then Lord Avonside goes on with great approbation to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"I pause to interject that that, in my understanding, is today in law the basic test and only test."</p></blockquote>
So the test is fairness, and it is quite clear if one reads Hartley, Rigg and Bullock and all sorts of others. We shall read this judgment extensively in the Committee when we come to clause 2, but, just taking that short extract as an aperitif to what is to come, it is quite clear that the test of fairness does not, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South suggests, mean that anything is inadmissible after suspicion has centred unless it is a spontaneous outburst unprovoked by questioning.<br><br>
In that situation, if the test is fairness, my guess—and none of us can know because the courts have never had to consider clause 1—is that when the courts come to consider an explanation offered in reply to a question on clause 1, it is extremely likely that they would allow that it was admissible, applying the test of fairness. Therefore, we would be in a situation where very often any sort of incriminating or damaging statement that was made in reply to this demand for an explanation will, if before a jury, be in the High Court of Justiciary, and in those circumstances it seems to me that it is important that we should have some sort of caution included in the Bill.<br><br>
I feel very strongly about this. Going back to Hartley—and I use it merely as a text which is to hand—those of us who are familiar with the case will remember that it involved the questioning of a youth of 17 by Detective Superintendent Sampson. I quote again from Lord Avonside's no doubt accurate account of what happened, in terms at least of the evidence that was given, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Detective Superintendent Sampson, who was in charge of the case, and a constable, Turner, saw the appellant at 2.30 a.m. on Thursday morning. His purpose was to go over the statement of the appellant in detail. He cautioned the appellant. He considered him a suspect."</p></blockquote>
I think it is clear from that—I use this as one example but one could duplicate it many times—that Lord Avonside is implying that of course he cautioned the suspect because he thought he was a suspect. Here we have a situation where quite simply we have someone who is by definition a suspect. One cannot operate clause 1 unless he is a suspect. My simple proposition to the Committee as a matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
of elementary justice and one which all of us ought to endorse is that, if one has someone who is a suspect and one is not only just going to note a statement which is spontaneously given but one has specifically invited that statement from him by asking him for an explanation, it follows as night follows day, given the fact that that explanation could well be admissible as evidence, given the present practice of the courts, that there ought at that stage to be an adequate caution or, at least, that the man should be told that he does not need to say anything at all. That seems a simple proposition but one of great importance.<br><br>
We have a suspicion; we have the demand for an explanation; we do not have a caution in the Bill as it presently stands. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South will give the assurance that he wants a caution written in but he is not satisfied with my caution, I think I speak for all of us if I say that we should be very happy to withdraw this form of words on the understanding that another form of words will come forward either from the Conservative Front Bench or indeed from the Conservative Back Benches.<br><br>
This is something which we must look at closely and pursue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing or interpreting this clause in such a way that, if no caution was given, in all the circumstances what was said in answer to that would be admissible as evidence, or inadmissible? If the ordinary laws of evidence apply which are established in common law, why is there a need for a caution at this stage?<br><br>
If the points in the statement which is obtained are to be used in evidence, surely there is nothing in the Bill which would put those to the side? If the particular circumstances were such that one wanted to use that statement in evidence against that person, why does the common law of Scotland with regard to statements obtained not continue to apply, whether or not there is a caution within this clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is saying. It is because I think that the common law of Scotland will apply that I think that it will be better to have the caution. My thesis is that it might be admissible, with or without a caution,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
because the test—Lord Avonside says the only test—is: is it fair?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is referring to what Lord Avonside said in Hartley, he must follow it through and read it properly. What is being considered by Lord Avonside there is, first, referring to the test in Chalmers; then talking about in what circumstances he may continue to question: whether it goes beyond the bounds of cross-examination and into interrogation. It is specifically in those circumstances that Lord Avonside says that it is very difficult to say what is interrogation and what is cross-examination: what one has to look at is whether it is fair. To refer to what Lord Avonside said there and attempt to translate it into the set of circumstances that might apply in clause 1 is improper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it is improper at all. We might argue that but let us get to the point. If the hon. Member is saying to me that, as clause 1 is drafted, anything that is said in reply to a request for explanation is not admissible as evidence, and if that is backed up by the Solicitor-General, it certainly would remove many of our fears. Clearly, then we would not have to worry about it being incriminating in court if it was clearly inadmissible.<br><br>
However, I do not believe that that is the position. I believe that the courts, given the modern judgments, given that the test of fairness is the over-riding consideration, may well say that this was fairly obtained and it should be admissible. We would await the final judgment of the Solicitor-General on it, but if there is no danger of that I might well be prepared to look at my anxieties again and recognise that they are exaggerated. But if the Solicitor-General says to me, as I think in all honesty he will have to, that this may be admissible evidence, just applying the normal rules, we need the caution. That is a simple proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that the great mistake that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is making is that he obviously believes that this Bill is going to be read only by lawyers. Clause 1 is about defining the police powers.<br><br>
Is it not right that when a Bill is defining the police powers in relation to a suspected
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
person, it is also right and proper in that same clause to define the suspected person's rights in relation to the police? Is this not the core of the debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There are the two levels, as I said at the beginning of the debate. I agree with my hon. Friend. There are two reasons for having this: one is to inform the person who is suspected of his rights, which is very important. I am not being sarcastic when I say that the hon. Member for South Angus would appreciate that, given his past interests. Then there is the second level which he is now arguing about with me, which is the admissibility and the legal concept. It is a perfectly simple proposition that I am putting: if he is right in saying that under no circumstances would it be admissible, then at that level we do not need the caution but we still need the information. It does no harm and it is helpful informing the public.<br><br>
If there is a danger, as I think, that it will be admissible, then, applying the test of fairness, we need the caution. That is a simple argument and one which I would certainly found on. I do not want to rub salt in the hon. Gentleman's wounds, but I was supported in this by the Solicitor-General at earlier sittings.<br><br>
I had the opportunity of re-reading, when I came in early to the Committee, the Solicitor-General's speeches, particularly column 88 of the second sitting of the Committee where he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"But I made no suggestion, nor would I have made a suggestion, in any of those remarks"—</p></blockquote>
that is, his remarks on the previous Labour Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"that the caution should be a statutory caution."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April 1980; c. 88.]</p></blockquote>
That is a piece of special pleading. It is dancing on the head of a pin. I would not use terms like paranoid humbuggery in describing it, but let me remind him again, very briefly, of what he said at column 38 when he was talking specifically in the context of an amendment which he was rightly disapproving for other reasons, an amendment which was going to produce a caution, a warning that the person need not make any response, and then went on to provide other forms of sanctions which the Committee was not willing to accept. In the context of talking about the need for a caution he said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"I stress that it is important that a person should be warned at this very early stage that he need not give an explanation to a police officer"—</p></blockquote>
he went on at column 40 of the same debate—
<br><blockquote><p>"I suggest that we should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations, without warning that people need not give them at that stage."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 38, 40.]</p></blockquote>
The Solicitor-General is entitled to say that he has changed his mind, that he was merely going in for an Opposition exercise —we are all guilty of that on occasion— but he cannot say he did not argue that case. I found it persuasive then, as I think I made clear in the debates, and I find it persuasive now. It is on that basis that I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only a moment or two remains and we shall be having another
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
sitting this afternoon. I had hoped that we would have had a reasonable unanimity throughout the Committee. I think that all of us from time to time exaggerate and emphasise in order to arrive at the truth, certainly on this side of the Committee, but there are occasions when, quite apart from the main objections to the Bill, we have to say to ourselves that if these provisions are going to go through we must get it right and we have got to get the safeguards.<br><br>
This might not be regarded in this context were one to accept the position put forward by the hon. Member—</span></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
