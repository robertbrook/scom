	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 has considerable merit. The same provision appeared in the Labour Government's Bill. It is unfortunate that it appears in part I, with some very objectionable clauses, as it is rather more liberal-minded than the rest of part I and takes a more liberal approach to the law and to police powers. The rest of part I increases police powers and encroaches on the rights of the individual, but in some ways clause 5 is an attempt to try to improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think most members of the Committee agree that, as at present worded, clause 5 is a step in the right direction. It is an attempt to see the problems of the drunken offender in a new light—to see the drunken offender as someone who, in many cases, needs treatment rather than prosecution and the full process of the law. That view is borne out by the criminal statistics relating to this problem. The figures show that very few people charged with any of the drunkenness offences are sentenced to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
imprisonment. Very few people are sentenced to imprisonment for being drunk and disorderly or drunk and incapable, but I should be interested to know how many are finally imprisoned because of their failure to pay the fines imposed. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General could answer that question, among others, because it is one that concerns us. It appears to be the case in England and Wales that large numbers of people are fined for the offence, but eventually serve a prison sentence since, because of the position they are in, they are incapable of paying their fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is worded at present is to give the constable a pure right to make up his own mind whether he will take a person to any place:
	<br><blockquote><p>"designated by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 189 is designed, first, to clarify the circumstances in which a person shall be taken to a designated place. I have separated subsection (1) into two parts. First, there is the case when a constable would have arrested a person without warrant on a drink charge—that is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for being drunk and disorderly, drunk and incapable, drunk and in charge of a child, and drunk and attempting to enter licensed premises".</p></blockquote>
I left out of that list at least one other instance—drinking or drunk in a shebeen. There is still such an offence on the statute book in Scottish law, but I did not think it entirely relevant to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those charges are clearly drunkenness charges. They have nothing to do with any other offence. They are purely concerned with the effect of drink. Where that is the case, the constable shall take the person to a designated place. I have tried to say in amendment No. 188 what those designated places will be. Being fair-minded, I acknowledge that in certain cases the constable may not be able, or may not wish, to take a person to a designated place. My amendment allow some modification of that absolute "shall."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First there has to be some procedure for a case where a person refuses to be taken to a designated place. For example one could imagine that for the first time in five years the Solicitor-General was out on a bender and became so drunk and incapable that the police picked him up. He is not in need of treatment for drink; he does not require to be taken to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
designated place so he says "I should prefer to be taken straight to the police station and charged with an offence, and that's it. I don't need treatment. I don't need to be taken to this designated place." Such a person may not wish to go, and he should be given that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the constable thinks that his initial charge would have been drunk and incapable, or one of the other drunken charges, but he feels that another offence has been committed by that person, he should be able to take him to the police station and charge him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there will be many places in Scotland where designated places, certainly in the short term, will not be available or accessible. For example, if someone who is drunk and incapable is picked up in one of the Western Isles, or even in a boat, the nearest designated place may be Inverness. The constable could not take the person there within a time during which it would do much good. In that case, the constable would take him to the police station and charge him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a certain amount of leeway, but I think that there should be a mandatory imposition on the constable to take to a designated place a person accused of drink charges, with the exceptions I have made, rather than that it should be something that the constable may do if he wishes as the clause states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the clause and in the amendment, we are attempting to find some way of doing two specific jobs. One is to try to cure the problems of the drunken person in our society. We are too well aware in Scotland that this is an immense problem. We want to take such people off the streets and cure them of their problem and their dependence upon alcohol. That is the first thing that we should attempt to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aim is the public expenditure aspect, although I agree that there may be some public expenditure involved in the first. We want to take pressure off the police station, particularly on a Friday or a Saturday night, off the courts, and off the prisons by trying to treat such people rather than locking them up in the cells, charging them with offences, bringing them before the courts, having them fined, finding them incapable of paying their fines and then having them finish up in prison. That is public expenditure which most hon. Members would agree is not warranted and we should try to stop it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
Some concern has been expressed—that concern came after I had written the amendment—by various organisations, including the Federation of Alcoholic and Residential Establishments, the Lothian social work department and the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless. I gather that these organisations had a meeting about the clause with officials from the Scottish Office last week. They came away, whether rightly or wrongly, I am not sure, with the impression that in talking about designated places the Scottish Office was considering night shelters for drunken or homeless people. In other words, they interpret that as meaning a Salvation Army home or other organisations of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the greatest concern among all these organisations, which are very aware of the problems of a drunken person, that that is what Ministers intend when they implement the Bill. The fear is that the Ministers will take the Salvation Army home, perhaps in Edinburgh, and make it a designated place. If that is so, we may as well take the clause out of the Bill here and now, because it will serve no purpose. In many cases night shelters are being increasingly condemned by those involved in the rehabilitation of alcoholics as being unsuitable for the job, not capable of doing it because of a lack of trained staff, and not as hygienic as or giving the same kind of care as a police station. The Government may intend merely that there should be night shelter accommodation at designated places for the care of the drunken offender. I prefer that he goes to the police station and is charged rather than be put in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 188, which is a new schedule, I have given specifications of what designated places should be. Various principles are involved in the schedule. The first is that this matter should be the concern of the regional authority. It should submit to the Secretary of State a list of places to be designated by him as being suitable for the care of the drunken offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting the new schedule, I was in difficulties because I was aware that I could not subvent the money resolution, so I had to word it so vaguely, almost, that while it was not exactly meaningless, it did not have anything like the clarity that I preferred. Can the Minister say whether under clause 77, which allows money that presumably is included in the money
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
resolution to be given, such establishments may benefit in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such places should be under the control of the regional authority, and the social work department, in conjunction with the local health boards, should oversee them. It is, of course, the responsibility of the Secretary of State to designate, but I suggest that within six months of the Bill being enacted each authority should submit a list of places it considers suitable for designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have laid down certain criteria for accommodation which most night shelters would not meet. The first is that the accommodation meets the needs of the drunken person. That is rather general and wide, but it means that there has to be a bed or somewhere for the person to sleep not merely a mattress on the floor, which often happens in shelters for drunken people, or some hammock accommodation. Equally—no one would deny this, although some night shelters would not meet this requirement—the statutory and local authority health and safety standards must be complied with in the building. Thirdly—this is in some ways the most important requirement—there shall be on the staff of the designated place at least one person who is qualified to take care of a drunken person. It could be a doctor—although it is unlikely—or a social worker or someone with a nursing or other paramedical qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a new area here, so I have left it that if there is no qualified person, if the social work department or the local health board feels that there is a person on the staff who has considerable experience in dealing with drunken people that, too, shall be suitable. I did not wish to make it so absolute that there had to be a qualified person. There are many people who have devoted their time voluntarily to this kind of work and have given much effort and experience—perhaps more than a young newly qualified social worker or even a newly qualified doctor—and simply through their experience these people should be allowed to play their part in the institution or designated place. It would be totally wrong, when we are dealing with something as new as this—it is a new concept—to bar from dealing with drunken people those who have experience, even though they have no paper qualifications. I think that we all know of those who have given a lot of time to voluntary social work without necessarily gaining qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new schedule then states—which is where I must use the word "may"—that where local authorities feel that there are not sufficient places, they may, if they so wish, establish their own. Equally, they may give grants to other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of my new schedule makes it clear that we are concerned not with just getting rid of the drunken person from the police station and the court and allowing him back on the streets but with rehabilitation. It was suggested to me rather late by the director of social work of Lothian region, and I gather that it came from the Association of Directors of Social Work, that it would have been sensible—if I had had time I probably would have done it—to have included after the word "care" in subsection (1), and perhaps in my amendments, the words "and rehabilitation of drunken persons". Depending on the Government's response to my amendments, I may consider doing that on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the new schedule takes care of that to some extent. It provides that a person taken into one of the designated places shall be offered treatment for his problems. I think that most of us would accept that those who are found drunk and incapable have a problem of alcoholism, particularly those regularly found so. Most people now recognise that alcoholism is not a crime. It is a medically recognisable disease and should be treated accordingly. I am not saying that the treatment should be mandatory. It should be offered by the qualified or experienced person and the offender should be asked to stay for such time as the qualified or experienced person considers necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment and the new schedule give some meat to what the clause is trying to suggest. Without them, the clause will be wide open. If we had a Government committed to expanding public expenditure and the social services, we should say "Hear, hear", and let the clause go ahead as it stands. But we do not have such a Government. Therefore, we must tighten up the clause and give some indication where the Government and the Committee intend it to go to ensure that the principle behind it is carried out in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause could work and be a panacea to all the ills of alcoholism if certain people, the Secretary of State included, used it rightly and spent money to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
that facilities were available for rehabilitation. Equally, if there is no commitment to provide money and ensure that there are proper designated places with trained and qualified people available on the premises, and if the idea is that the places should be the night shelters, or wet shelters, as they are sometimes called, the clause is a dead duck from the word "go".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Government will feel that my amendments are provocative or are trying to get across some wild socialist point. They attempt to clarify. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter, although I accept that he may point out that the drafting of these amendments is not in order, or is faulty. I am still a comparatively new boy here, and I accept that my drafting may not be correct. The drafting is very much my own, but I hope that the Minister will accept the principles that lie behind the amendments. If he considers the drafting faulty, I hope that he will at least promise to come back on Report with amendments better than my own, but which embody the principles that I have tried to insert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will forgive me if, while acknowledging that his amendments are entirely well-intentioned, I first state one principle. The common law has vast advantages over all statute law in that it can be adapted to any situation since it embodies matters of principle rather than absolutes. To the extent that statute law is necessary at all, it is desirable as far as possible that it should not only clear but flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, correctly, this is a new departure, and a humane departure, and is not a matter of division between the two sides of the Committee. The fact is that people who are drunk and incapable, drunk and disorderly, or drunk and anything else, are a nuisance to other people and may be frightening. For that reason, hitherto drunkenness has been a criminal offence, and a large proportion of cases are in fact treated and charged as breaches of the peace, which they are—that is the menace—rather than as drunkenness as an offence in itself. But I do not think that we should overlook the scale of the problem, which is fairly considerable. It is estimated that there are probably 3,000 homeless alcoholics in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
Scotland, not all of whom are necessarily habitual drunken offenders. Some may never have been charged with any offence at all—breach of the peace or any form of drunkenness. In 1976, there were 18,477 cases of people found drunk and incapable, and 202 drunk and disorderly. In the last criminal statistics, the figures are similar—about 15,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are anxious to separate those more sinned against than sinning from those who are more sinning than sinned against. For that reason, we do not wish to apply either the indignity or the rigour of the criminal process to those who merely suffer from an addiction to, or dependence on, alcohol. That was the motivation of the recommendation of the Thomson committee. It was the motivation of the Labour Government when they introduced this provision, and I am sure is the motivation of all of us in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has attempted to categorise those persons who must be taken to designated places. With the greatest respect to him, there are many matters which I should like to categorise, but I think that probably one of the most difficult questions to be dogmatic about is when a person falls into categories such as he has produced in his amendment—"drunk and disorderly" or "drunk and incapable." There are so many spheres of intoxication, so many manifestations of disorder, and so many variables in any particular situation that to attempt to categorise persons into one type of drunk or another is impossible. I should prefer that the constable used his judgment in the circumstances of the situation. He may come along and say "Here is poor old Maxton again, plastered. We will take him to the reception centre." He might, on the other hand, find someone completely unknown to him who is being aggressive and upsetting people, and that would be a very different situation. But both might be drunk and disorderly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not give those offences off the top of my head. I took them from the list of classified crimes and offences, appendix I to the criminal statistics for Scotland. I clearly separate those offences. Being drunk and disorderly may have other connotations. But if the constable does not want to charge a person with being drunk and disorderly, he can normally charge him with some other offence. Subsection (1A)
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
of my amendment, which essentially is the same as the first part of the clause itself, deals with that problem and the one that the Solicitor-General is raising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another difficulty raised by the hon. Gentleman's intervention is that there is almost no situation in which the constable could not elude this provision. It is rare that a person who is in any of these categories is not also committing a breach of the peace, and so it would be a chimaera rather than a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we must leave it to the judgment of the individual policeman in the innumerable and variable situations in which this will arise to decide what is the right thing to do. I do not think that we, attempting to anticipate all the possible categories and situations, ought to attempt to imagine how this clause will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member suggests that a person shall be allowed not to go to a designated place if he refuses. We have discovered in England that more than 50 per cent. of those who are told they are to be taken to a designated place refuse to go. But when they have been taken, since they cannot refuse to go, there is a considerable chance that they will remain and will be sympathetic to or tolerant of attempts to treat them. It is getting them there which is the stumbling block. It is to be hoped that they will be persuaded to remain when they get there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard to imagine that some people could be more unreasonable when they are drunk than when they are sober. Of course, I do not refer to any member of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even autobiographically?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Therefore I think that it is important that the person cannot just say "I am drunk. I am petulant. I am obstinate because I am drunk. I am not going."

The second matter raised by the hon. Gentleman is the new schedule, which is a very complicated anticipation of all sorts of regulations. It is almost a compilation of the Factories Acts, the Health and Safety at Work Act, the Shops Act and the working hours legislation. If we accepted the schedule, these reception centres would almost be subject to more statutory care and attention than those who were taken to them. We cannot anticipate how in any particular area the co-ordination of voluntary effort—the Salvation Army, which plays an excellent part, and all sorts of other organisations—will operate when the Secretary of State has designated places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has said twice that we cannot anticipate in this Committee. The whole purpose of legislation is to try to anticipate and legislate for these likely events. All legislation deals with the future and future circumstances. I cannot see how we can possibly fault the very careful drafting of the new schedule on that basis. On the contrary, it is analogous to any other schedule dealing with places for residential care. It lays down the circumstances, the basic requirements and the conditions. Why it can be faulted on a general basis, I cannot understand. If the Solicitor-General has any specific points, we shall be glad to hear them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, legislation attempts to anticipate the future. But as a general rule it is wiser if it does not attempt to anticipate its effect with certainty, but leaves it to the Bill to be effective as a result of its flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a novel situation. It is an attempt to be humane. It is obvious that the situation of an upright citizen found drunk after a Socialist Workers' Party dinner in Tiree, who has never been drunk before, will be different from that of somebody living in a model lodging house or under a bridge over the Clyde in the middle of Glasgow. The variations are so multiple that it is unreasonable to try to pin the matter down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he was not trying to make a Socialist point, or
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
anything like that. In fact, he made a very Socialist point. He said that unless the Secretary of State spent money, the idea would not work. He said that the Government were not committed to expanding public expenditure, but that the Secretary of State should give the money. Here is the rich Secretary of State who will go to the bank, take out some of his money and give it. The money is not there. The hon. Gentleman is inviting the Government to spend money that is not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not there. The biggest item of expenditure in the Budget this year is the interest on the money that his Government spent that they did not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Claw back the handouts to the rich. The Government will get plenty of money from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that in allowing a small reference to the monetary side we shall not expand this into a debate on the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this specific point, rather than on the wider Budget implications in the tortuous arguments that the Solicitor-General for Scotland is putting forward on the economy, will the hon. and learned Gentleman accept that, if this is carried out properly, money will be available? Savings elsewhere in public expenditure can be used. Savings will be made by cutting the number of people in prison, which is a public saving on the police and courts in dealing with these people. That money would be available. If he gave Opposition Members a guarantee that the money saved would be diverted to this purpose, we should feel a little happier than we do at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not have gone up the road of those who believe that spending is of itself the essence of virility. But it is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Maxton) to remain virile, but we do not want merely a commitment to luxury extravagance on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to put this provision in the Bill, and in all the circumstances of all the different places in Scotland and all the different circumstances of each case in which drunkeness in any form is involved, to use it in order to make a humane treatment for those who essentially are a public nuisance because they are committed to, or controlled by, alcohol, rather than to punish them for what is in reality no more than an affliction which may become an unfortunate disturbance for other people. We are anxious to make it work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman said. The Secretary of State—I urge this upon the hon. Gentleman, and I am not being obstructive—that in an act of humanity of the scale of this departure we should leave the matter as simple and as flexible as possible. I urge him to accept the Government's commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I accept that it would be difficult to introduce a schedule with the type of provisions that, with the best of intentions, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has suggested, does my hon. and learned Friend recognise there is considerable concern in Scotland about the absence of any definition of the type of establishment that the Secretary of State might designate? Would he not accept that there is some validity in the point that the hon. Member for Cathcart made that it would be unfortunate if the type of establishment to be designated were of a lower standard than might be expected in an ordinary police station? If that were so, although this is an extremely emancipated and important item in this legislation, it would be very regrettable if that type of establishment were to be allowed to continue when we were trying to improve the position for these unfortunates in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be honest with my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), I have seen a very large number of police cells—with the door fortunately open, or closed with a return ticket—and I cannot imagine much more barren facilities. But the Committee must remember that these will be places which can be provided under the Social Work (Scotland) Act, and the Government are investigating what regula-
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
tions are necessary in order to enlarge the provisions that may be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However we must be realistic about this matter. Designated places must be places where the person will be encouraged to stay, and where he will obtain some help in his difficulty or will be guided to a place where he will be treated. But we do not want to be too Utopian in our imaginings of those who are committed alcoholics and who have fallen foul of the various categories of drunkeness in one form or another—drunk and disorderly, drunk and incapable, and so on. I doubt that even the most devoted staff of the Andrew Duncan clinic would imagine that the retrieval rate for those persons would be particularly high, even if they underwent a course there. Therefore, let us not set out sights too high. Let us remember that we are indulging in an act of humane decency towards people who are pitiful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman was underlining the fact that these places would not be luxurious or Utopian, as he had earlier seemed to think might be the case. I wish he would go to these places and see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been to a very large number of such places and seen them. One cannot expect them to be places of grandeur, but let us hope that they will be places of mercy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To use a most abused phrase in this Committee, I rise to intervene briefly, largely because I have an amendment on the Notice Paper which I think I should draw to the Solicitor-General's attention. It is perhaps a minor probing amendment, but it is worth a small hearing. Amendment No. 85 seeks to add the words "and incapable" after the word "drunk" in line 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter was debated, as has so often happened, on the last Administration's Bill. The Solicitor-General will remember that he was one of those on the Opposition Front Bench. I would not wish to give prime of place either to him or to his Under-Secretary since I am sure they are a harmonious team. He will see that in the fourth sitting of that Committee he moved an amendment to add the words "relating to drunkenness". I had some sympathy with his argument, which sought to limit—in this sense I am being a little more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
authoritarian than the Government—the policeman's discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman argued at that time, I think rightly, that people who were affected by drink but whose main offence was considerable in its own right irrespective of drink could, through an error of judgment, end up inappropriately in a detoxification centre. He wished to insert the words "relating to drunkenness" to ensure that the offence was basically an offence of drunkenness, either being drunk and incapable or a similar offence where the accused's principal characteristic was that he was under the influence of drink and not merely committing a common law offence, which under any circumstances would be a common law offence and might or might not have been aggravated by drink taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that that was a reasonably sensible limitation. It was in that spirit that I suggested that the words "drunk and incapable" should appear in this Bill. I hoped that it would not discourage any constable who wished to use the very welcome powers of this clause, but would ensure that the people taken to detoxification centres were those who would particularly benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt, Mr. Gourlay, that you will later allow a brief debate on clause stand part, when we can perhaps talk about the wider issues of detoxification centres. Therefore, I confine myself to those brief and, I hope, specific remarks on the amendment in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to draw attention to the fact that we ought not to introduce into legislation provision whose cost we have not looked at carefully enough. I am always terribly worried that, however well intentioned they may be, they could add greatly to the cost by requiring considerable sacrifices elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is in the Bill because in Scotland we have an enormous drink problem. It ought to be acknowledged and recognised and not swept under the carpet. Having recognised it, we must then say that the problem falls into two fairly clearly defined categories. There are those who are drunk and who are a problem only because they are drunk; and there are those who have been drinking and are a problem because drink makes them violent and dangerous. I accept that. I appreciate that that is the motivation behind the clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
and I sympathise with that. I wish that we lived in an ideal world where we could find the wherewithal to solve this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is very concerned about the cost of providing this kind of care. He has tabled an amendment dealing with birching. He has looked at the cost of the birches that we would need throughout Scotland for the flogging that he proposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be improper for me to answer that, but at least I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, which was remarkable, because I listened to the hon. Gentleman for a long time this morning and could not make out a word that he was saying. Perhaps it was just as well!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point. We have to be careful when we introduce legislation that it is financially practicable and possible. That is essential. We should also recognise that we have to move slowly in this area because it is such an enormous problem. It is like diving into the deep end. We do not really know the depth and scale of the problem, and therefore it would be most unwise for us to include the new schedule. It is an amalgam of all sorts of other provisions and would add considerably to the cost burden on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be extremely grateful if the hon. Gentleman would show me where in the new schedule the extra cost will arise. There may be extra cost if the local authority so wishes, but except for that, the only extra cost would be the cost of employing people to inspect the premises of voluntary organisations. Presumably that would be done by existing social work and health authority personnel. There is no extra cost involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless I have difficulty reading, para 2 of part II clearly says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Social Work Department and Local Health Board shall inspect the designated places every six months".</p></blockquote>
I can see an immediate cost factor there. I support in principle what the hon. Member is trying to achieve. I am deeply concerned that we should not introduce into statute that which we have not carefully costed. I am prepared to speak to that later when I have the opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak loudly and particularly to amendment No. 188. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said that he had difficulty in hearing me. A moment ago he said that he had difficulty in reading. He must be in a very bad way!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been slightly taken aback by the concentration on the possible costs if we were to introduce this clause, buttressed by the schedule outlined in amendment No. 188. Surely we are agreed that we are not simply concerned, in clause 5, with the proposition. We are concerned that that proposition should lead to the right kind of treatment. I do not fault the clause as it stands, though. I think that it would be improved by my hon. Friend's amendment. But I do think that a schedule is necessary even if not this one. The schedule does no more than draw attention to the conditions that would be necessary if this proposition were to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dislike legislation which empowers constables to use their discretion to take people to detoxification units but does not set out the duties upon local authorities or other bodies to provide the right kind of detoxification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saddened by the words of the Solicitor-General at one point. He said that the Government were not concerned about providing accommodation in circumstances of luxury or in Utopian circumstances. He should really look at the voluntary community centres run at present, such as the Simon Community in Glasgow, the Cyrenean centre in Aberdeen and the Talbot centre which are working under such extreme difficulties that the Scottish Council for Single Homeless said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On behalf of the Council I would sincerely urge the Government to support an amendment that quite specifically defines a designated place as one that fits into the proper spectrum of provision required if the needs of the drunken offender are to be properly met"—</p></blockquote>
that is what my hon. Friend's schedule seeks—
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise they will be worse off physically than they are at present when they are in prison".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, when the comparison with prison is made, those who are involved in this sphere recognise the existing total inadequacy of these centres so that to an extent they feel that the offender would often be better off in prison than in the sort of detoxification units that are established. It is right that a schedule should be intro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
duced which at least lays down minimum requirements, and if my hon. Friend's schedule is not accepted, there is a duty on the Solicitor-General to go through the schedule to point out those aspects to which he objects. Does he object to part I, paragraph 2, of the new schedule, for example? That paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such places shall be those that having been inspected by the Social Work Department and the Local Health Board, are considered to have met the criteria".</p></blockquote>
The criteria are listed in the new schedule. They relate to suitable accommodation, fire, health and safety standards and the presence of at least one person qualified to deal with drunken persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not rigid demands, and why the Solicitor-General should use terms such as "luxury" and "Utopia" I cannot understand. If the aim of the clause is to be met, there has to be provision made that the designated places should reach a certain standard which it would be perfectly appropriate for the Government to establish as a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that one of the shelters suggested as a likely designated place is in Aberdeen, where the managers of the Cyrenian group have taken a policy decision to close it down. Voluntary groups are in extremely difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the cuts. Therefore, the schedule is closely linked to the question of financial provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is right in that it is related to cost. The Solicitor-General and the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire tell us that there is no money available, but that is not true. There is money available—£1½ billion was given out to the top 7 per cent. of the richest earners in this country last year. Instead of giving money to those in need, the Government chose to give it to those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drunks of Scotland are in most desperate need of care, but instead of giving money in that direction, the Government chose to give it to the very rich. The money is there, but the Government are not prepared to make a decision to distribute it in that way. There is no shortage of money for what is needed if the Government remove a few hundred million pounds from the top 2 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not allowing discussion on the money side because the money resolution covers the situation, and that is irrelevant to the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely answering the point made by Conservative Members who said that the Government did not have the money. I agree with you, Mr. Gourlay, that a money resolution was moved by them in relation to the Bill which they assured us was competent to deal with the additional costs implied by the Bill. The total cost of running the Bill was given as £650,000. On a crucial clause such as this, which is one of the humane clauses of the Bill that we welcome, Conservative Members tell us that there is no money to meet these costs. It is quite directly related to the Bill and to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see that this problem has already arisen in relation to England and Wales—there is nothing new in it. Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 also dealt with the question, as hon. Members know. But eight years after the passing of that Act, there are only two such facilities designated in England and Wales—only two in eight years. Therefore, there is no point in passing a clause of this sort if it takes eight years to implement even two minor centres. Only in Leeds and Manchester have people grapsed the need to have such centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter from the Federation of Alcoholic Rehabilitation Establishments sets out requirements which, curiously enough, are exactly in line with the new schedule put forward by my hon. Friend. We must listen to these people who have devoted their lives to such groups of alcoholics, have worked with them and know their problems. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>"There should be minimum laid down physical and environmental standards.</li>
	<li>There should be provision for detoxification on a 24 hour basis, with appropriate social and medical care either available or on call.</li>
	<li>The centres should be formally recognised as the appropriate alternative to arrest and legal sanction with the clear aim of, on a local basis, becoming an effective means of diverting petty persistent drink offenders from the penal system."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is relevant to the intention of my hon. Friend's amendment. Like him, I am unable to say whether the drafting is absolutely correct. However, the so-called lack of flexibility, the sense that it is essential for such treatment to take place, is in line with the advice of those who are familiar with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"4. There should be no limit on the number of times an individual might use the centre.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>5. It should provide information and advice as appropriate, and should provide a clear channel of access whereby users might proceed to other rehabilitation facilities if they so desire."</p></blockquote>
That body, like the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, sees the designated places playing a part in the de-criminalisation of the drunken offender—the attempt to take him out of the penal system. However, there will be no means of achieving that if the sordid, squalid, abysmal slum conditions in which the units have to operate at present are allowed to continue. As one who has often gone to the Simon community to give things, to help out with food and so on, I can confirm that conditions are like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to improve conditions for a most deserving group of people. I cannot think of anything more shocking than Government hon. Members saying that they will not lay down conditions to allow the measures in the Bill to be implemented properly because the cost would be too great. It is not a question of cost but a question of choice. The Government have chosen to assist the rich and those who are able to look after themselves. It is time that they saw the logic of their own legislation and provided the means for the units to do an adequate job in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to de-criminalise the drunk and to bring in rehabilitation measures. That is a crucial issue in Scotland. Here is a glorious opportunity for the Solicitor-General to have his name go down in history as one of the great emancipators of the Scottish psyche. There could be a stone statue of him in Perth. We shall rejoice if he accepts the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Solicitor-General's response to the amendments rather disappointing. I admit that I did not expect him to accept the amendments and the new schedule in their present form. I accept that the wording is probably faulty in various respects. However, I expected him to have a more sympathetic approach to the underlying principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendment may be a little too tight. I certainly accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point about people not being allowed the right to refuse to be taken to a designated place. However, I hoped that he would accept the principle behind the rest of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
amendment and state his intention to return to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found his whole argument about the new schedule almost unbelievable. He tried to suggest that the intention of the schedule was to lay down in detail, including all the dots and commas, exactly what was to be in each designated place. That is far from the truth. The schedule would probably be considered far too loose and vague by most people concerned with the rehabilitation of drunken people. Most experts would want much more than is specified in the schedule. However, as you might point out, Mr. Gourlay, I was to some extent restricted by the money resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also considered that, as we were dealing with a fairly new concept, the schedule should be vague enough to allow voluntary bodies and other expert organisations to play their full part. That would not necessitate any great input of public money. The idea that the six-monthly inspection of such places would be an enormous burden on the public purse is quite incredible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that my schedule might have been treated more sympathetically. The Solicitor-General could have said that although the Government could not accept my amendment but that they recognise that something must be done about the conduct of designated places, and that therefore the Secretary of State will introduce an amendment on Report, which will make regulations as to the conduct of places so designated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is rejected, I shall move an amendment on Report to require the Secretary of State to make regulations as to the conduct of places designated under this clause. I still might have reservations about it, because I might not like the regulations that the Secretary of State made, but there would at least be some commitment about such places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific questions that I asked on costs were not answered. I shall ask them again now if I may, Mr. Gourlay. First, I shall be grateful if the Solicitor-General will tell us the number of people who are in prison. Secondly, I would ask him to clarify clause 77 which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After section 27A of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 there shall be inserted the following section—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Grants in respect of hostel accommodation for persons under supervision.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>27B. The Secretary of State may make to a local authority grants of such amount and subject to such conditions as he may with the consent of the Treasury determine in respect of expenditure … under this Act in providing residential accommodation wholly or mainly for the persons mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of section 27(1)(	<i>b</i>)of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
I shall be grateful if he will tell us whether clause 77 will apply to pele taken into hospital care under clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 61 of schedule 5, dealing with legal custody, proposes to substitute the following section for section 426 of the 1975 Act:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person required or authorised by or under this Act or Part I of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 to be taken to any place, or to be detained or kept in custody shall, while being so taken or detained or kept, be deemed to be in legal custody."</p></blockquote>
If those two are taken together it means that a person taken to a designated place for the care of drunken people under clause 5 will, under these terms, be deemed to be in legal custody. If he is in legal custody, does it mean that he is under supervision and that grants will be forthcoming from the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument on expense may already be covered. It may be that the money is already there under the existing legislation, if the clause is interpreted in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a plea, both from the Solicitor-General and from the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) about the increased money that might be required to do the job properly. It would be futile to include a clause in the Bill unless it is intended to do it properly, but the Government, far from increasing money for these organisations and bodies is cutting it, although not directly in the Bill or through grants. I believe that most of us had a letter recently from the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Responsibility with a copy of a letter it sent to the Secretary of State for Social Services, in which it expressed concern about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the abolition of the Supplementary Benefits Commission and their power to exercise discretion in payments, (paragraph 4(1) 4(1)(	<i>a</i>) of Schedule 1, Supplementary Benefits Act, 1976)."</p></blockquote>
The letter says that in the majority of their 81 homes and establishments there will be no difficulty. The Committee has six specialist hostels in Scotland for recovering alcoholics, with accommodation for 92 residents, who would have been entitled to supplementary benefit payable to the hostel for overnight accommodation, but it fears that that money will no longer be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
available under the new Social Security Act. If the money is not available, the committee will be unable to continue its present care for these drunken people because of the extra burden that the Bill imposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how my hon. Friends feel about this. Some may wish to respond to other parts of the debate. I did not wish to press the amendments to a Division, as I hoped that I would have a more sympathetic hearing from the Government, but now I am not so sure. I hope that the Solicitor-General for Scotland will make one more intervention which will allow me to make up my mind. I hope that he will answer the questions that I have posed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to reply to the hon. Gentleman. I also wish to speak to the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) with which I have sympathy. I will deal with the first. As regards his proposal to include the words "and incapable", I have never been sure how drunk one has to be to be incapable. Does it mean incapable of walking at all or incapable of walking straight? Does it mean incapable of thinking or incapable of thinking rationally or that one has to be comatose before being incapable? To restrict the provision to so advanced a state of intoxication and incapability might frustrate his intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I intended to answer his question about the number of people who end up in prison because of not being able to pay the fine. My answer must be that I do not have that information. It is unlikely that I will be able to get it. It would probably be an extremely complicated exercise but if I can get even so much as an estimated proportion I will write to him telling him what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's second question was whether it would be possible to deal with this matter under section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act. I must say something that I hope will clear the minds of hon. Members. This is a criminal Bill the purpose of which is to give the police a power that they do not have. If they find persons committing any of the offences with which we are dealing either they have to leave them where they are or they must
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
arrest them and take them to a police station. That is their only power. We are extending that power by saying that they may take a person to a designated place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is not for the Bill to set up those designated places. There is provision under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and under the urban aid programme. Those are the proper sources from which local authorities, knowing their budget and their commitments, will have to make their own priorities and their application to the Secretary of State for such support as he may reasonably think appropriate. It is not appropriate while debating this Bill to start suggesting what we should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 27 would not apply, It deals with after-care establishments and would not cover designated places under section 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman and that he will not divide the Committee. This is an experiment which we all hope will be successful. But whatever one's views of the finance that is available, let us not forget that the Government will have to provide funds and in each case there will be different requirements. Let us remember that the number of these persons—I do not know, for instance, how the number relates to the number of people in hospital in one night—is considerable and we cannot provide vast services. It is an attempt to introduce humanity into a branch of the law when people are unfortunate victims of their condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number of people who went to prison in England and Wales in 1977 for drinking offences was 2,697, which—oddly enough—was higher than it had been in previous years, despite the fact that people could no longer be imprisoned for drunkenness, as such, under the 1977 Criminal Law Act. One could not be imprisoned for drunkenness, but the number of people in prison for not paying fines increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to press these amendments at this point. We are all in sympathy with the motives behind the clause. It may be that some of us will wish to look at it further on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is that clause 5 stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. With great respect, the Committee started its proceedings at half-past four. It is now one hour and 10 minutes later and we have been discussing a series of fairly important amendments. It is now suggested that we ought not to have a debate on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all honesty, Mr. Gourlay, I must say that if the Committee is to proceed in this way it will do the work of the Committee no good. I plead with you, Mr. Gourlay, to allow a debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotalnd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland may ask "Why?" if he likes, but we are still living in a democracy, and there is no reason why we should not have a debate on clause stand part. Neither is there a reason why the debate need take any great time. But there are good reasons why a number of points—which could not be put within the restricted terms of the amendment—have not been put, and therefore should be made during a debate on clause stand part. I plead with you, Mr. Gourlay, to allow a debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was being guided by the proceedings of the Committee earlier today, but as subsection (2) of clause 5 has not been debated fully by way of amendments perhaps we could have a short debate on clause stand part. But I must indicate that I am not prepared to accept wide-ranging debates, such as we had this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am sorry, but I must protest. You are suggesting that the wide-ranging debate went away from the matters which were under discussion. As someone who contributed to that debate I would argue that everything that I said kept not only closely, but tightly, to the matter we were discussing. If you feel that you wish to object to particular hon. Members, perhaps you could exemplify them, Mr. Gourlay, because I have never found this treatment on a Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
before, and I have been in this House for 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have actually ruled very lightly during the whole proceedings of the Committee on the basis that there was an understanding as to the finishing date. But there seemed in my opinion to be a rather unnecessarily long debate this fornoon, and while I did not want to pull up the hon. Gentleman when he was in fact out of order, he must not assume that he was entirely in order. In any case, I am prepared to have a short debate on clause 5 stand part in view of the fact that subsection (2) has not been fully discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Gourlay, I will certainly not try your patience on this occasion. I am tempted into the debate, partly and initially, to say that I give a warm welcome to the clause. We have been dealing with controversial parts of the Bill up to now, and I think that we have divided against clause stand part on every occasion. I can confidently predict—I certainly speak for myself—that whatever reservations we may have about the future of the clause, we shall not be dividing against it. We positively wish it a fair wind and benevolent and sympathetic support from the Government. It is on that second point that some of us have at least minor reservations about its prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to make it clear that this is a discretionary power which will be left with a member of the police force, presumably the constable who arrests and charges the person who then becomes the accused. It will presumably be a matter entirely in police discretion whether the man is released, held in custody in the normal sense or taken to a detoxification centre. That will be a decision in which the fiscal will have no part whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume—perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland will be able to reassure me—that there will be fairly close monitoring, at least for a considerable period, to see how the provision operates. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and many other of my hon. Friends will be anxious to see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
what extent the provision is used by the police. We hope that they will be encouraged, not perhaps to take an over-enthusiastic view, because we must not swamp what facilities are available, but to have it in their minds as an active option when they are considering a case which falls within clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, if a decision is taken at a police station, it will then be up to the police to transport the person to the detoxification centre, rather than the social work department. That may seem a minor point, but it is one which I want to get clear in my own mind. There might be a case for saying that once that decision has been taken it could become—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause says "may take them."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points out that the clause says that they "may" take the person, but the word "may" is open to a number of interpretations. It leaves the situation ambiguous. I should be interested to hear the Solicitor-General for Scotland's view of the normal machinery that would operate in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, although someone may be taken to a detoxification centre, it will in no way affect the fiscal's range of options to proceed with the prosecution on the basis of the charge brought and the information given to him by the police. This is not an alternative to a prison sentence which may result from a prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision may reduce the prison population by stopping people being held in custody prior to their first appearance or prior to trial, if the magistrate finds himself in the unfortunate position of feeling that he cannot release the accused because of his clear onus in terms of drink addiction. He has no alternative at present to consigning him to Barlinnie. All those options presumably remain unaffected by clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go over familiarly ploughed ground, but I want to put in my plea about the provision of these facilities. We have been bandying about compliments regarding good intentions and good will. I accept that the Solicitor-General for Scotland and, no doubt, his colleagues, want the Bill to be a success. But I think that they will recognise that
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
there is a considerable limit to the additional strain that can be taken by the present voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to wander into the question of cuts in the general economic sense. But I have had contact over a number of years with voluntary organisations, some of them in this specific area, and I know that they are feeling the pinch as they have not felt it before. They are struggling, some of them desperately, to maintain their level of service. There is no prospect, with present financial provision of any kind of expansion, in the Simon Community, the Talbot centre, the Salvation Army or any other organisation that provides facilities that might be used under clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the option that we are creating for the enlightened police constable, who considers that it is in the community's best interests that a person receives treatment, is to be a real option, I am afraid that some energetic steps will have to be taken either to support private initiative—the voluntary organisations—with State help, or to enable local authorities to help, as I am sure they would wish to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said about the English experience. My hon. Friend picked up my 	<i>sotto voce</i> remark that it sounded rather like the tale about tape recordings. The Committee will remember that eight years have passed and we are still carrying out tentative little experiments. Eight long years have passed since the Criminal Justice Act 1972 became law, and we are told on reliable authority that only two facilities—an ugly word—have been designated in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to see some traces—perhaps rather faint—of the liberal past of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) when the hon. Gentleman piped up his caveat in defence of the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I hope that I speak for all members of the Committee when I say that we hope that substantial progress will be made in designating places and in making the funds and resources available so that this option is available to police constables who might wish, very properly, to exercise it. I do not know how that will be done. I do not know what encouragement the Solicitor-General can give us. I recognise that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
Law Officers are not in charge of the purse-strings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be being over-confident in hoping that the Solicitor-General will be able to be rather more forthcoming than he has been so far, but I can assure him that we shall ask frequently for information about how many places have been designated and what support is going to this programme. Good intentions are of no use at all if we do not have the resource on the ground, and we desperately need this resource to relieve the pressure on the prison polulation and to help those poor unfortunates who might benefit. If not all the facilities are needed for the narrow use under section 5 of this Act, as it may one day be, there will always, unfortunately, be a need for support and help in the community for people with a drink problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not made that point at tedious length. I give this measure my support. I welcome the fact that clause 5 has survived the disaster of the last general election and lives again, even in a Conservative Bill, but I assure Conservative Members of the Committee that we expect action, as well as two paragraphs of black print in an Act of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support clause 5. It identifies what is in Scotland an enormous and very difficult problem. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) made that observation, and to that extent his speech was sound. It is an enormous problem and one that we shall have to tackle soon. A great deal of work has been done on the prblem, however, and I took exception to part of what the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire said. We know a lot about the problem. Extensive studies have been carried out into the problem in Scotland. It has been widely aired in some of our newspapers. Last Sunday's 	<i>Sunday Mail</i> carried an excellent centrepiece on health conditions in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will be persuaded soon to ask the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs to investigate alcoholism. That would be a very useful investigation. I expect that hon. Members in all parts of the Committee will support that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for us to make a declaration and say in two paragraphs that
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
the problem exists and that we will establish places
	<br><blockquote><p>"designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this section as a place suitable for the care of drunken persons."</p></blockquote>
It is very easy to do that. If, in the first place, the Government take on the commitment of having such places and the Secretary of State is to have the commitment of designating such places, we must be prepared to find the funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) very reasonably withdrew his amendment—I am not sure that I would have done that in his place, but he is a very reasonable man—but if clause 5 reaches the statute book, we shall be required to carry out the provisions of the new schedule anyway, because that must flow from designating places. The Secretary of State cannot designate places and then take no responsibility for what goes on inside them. Undoubtedly social work departments throughout the country will have to do that work and local health boards will have to inspect them and be satisfied on the medical provisions within such establishments. Fire, health and safety standards will have to be consistent with the existing statute, because that would be a requirement anyway. Those conditions would have to obtain to places designated by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will feel able to give some undertaking that they will be prepared to provide the funds. There is no doubt that charities are no longer able to do that. I do not want to wander into the realms of cost, but the Church of Scotland has a contracting capacity for making such a provision. Local authorities faced with a reduction in the funds available from the central Exchequer will first protect their own organisation. That means that charities which have hitherto received grants will not now receive such grants. That happened in 1976 in Tayside region. When the social work department there was faced with cuts from the central Exchequer, it decided to look carefully at external organisations which were receiving grants. I make that point specifically to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire because that happened, in his area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I believe that clause 5 is to be welcomed in relation to the Scottish drink problem, the Government must give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
an undertaking that they will honour their commitment. That means that the Government must provide funds for such centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be very brief because I made some points on the new schedule and I do not want to take much more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I was sticking closely to the amendment, I was not given an opportunity to give a general welcome to these proposals. I understand that the reference to speeches possibly being out of order was to those of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) and South Angus (Mr. Fraser). Therefore, I feel absolved from those implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is to be a designation by the Secretary of State for Scotland, will the Solicitor-General let us know what criteria will be established? Will he approve of a place or will he lay down minimal conditions before a local authority or a local area opens such a place? To what extent will the Secretary of State be involved in either having to endorse or, in advance, to set down criteria? I should like to hear from the Solicitor-General on that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to stress how strongly I welcome the clause. Undoubtedly the drug problem in Scotland is not the same drug problem we mean when we talk about police powers of search—of "sus" in England and Wales. The problem in Scotland is alcoholism. This is the first step in recognising that it is not merely a criminal problem but a medical and social problem and it must be seized with both hands. It raises the question of costs sharply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge those responsible for bringing the Bill forward, both the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary, to use what pressure they can to make sense of this clause, which has been universally approved, so that the anxieties of the voluntary bodies can be allayed and we can proceed in a proper fashion, publicly financed and equipped, in designated centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like, I think, every other member of the Committee, I welcome the provisions of clause 5, even though I have some reservations about its loose wording. But the major point, which I think has
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
been made by every Opposition Member, is that, without a financial commitment, it will not work. We have to see what is happening with regard to money and get it into perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales at present there are 63 residential facilities for drunken offenders run by non-statutory organisations. That is 80 per cent. of all organisations for drunken offenders. Government funding for 32 of these facilities expires this year. In another 10 cases, local authorities have said already that they will not continue funding after this year. Even the other 22 have considerable problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, even as we are introducing this legislation in Scotland, such provision as already exists in England and Wales appears to be collapsing around our ears. There is little point in producing this legislation if we do not have some guarantee—we are not asking for luxurious homes for these people—that some money will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The revenue to the Government from the tax on alcohol in 1978 was £2,800 million. Surely it is not unreasonable for the Government, having got that money from alcohol, to put a fair amount of it back into solving the problems that alcohol causes. The invested capital of the drink industry is £1,700 million. Of the gross national product, 4.5 per cent. is in the drink industry. Again it does not seem unreasonable that taxation on the profits of those companies should be put towards solving some of the problems created by their products, whereas last year, as we have heard, the Government gave money back to these companies instead of taking it from them and perhaps solving some of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, enormous social costs arise from alcoholism and its related problems. It has been estimated that in 1977 the loss of industrial production through alcoholism was £350 million in this country and that the total loss, including illness, accident, fires, property damage and so on, was about £1,000 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that what can be done under clause 5 is very limited, but it will be valuable if it makes some saving in return for that £1,000 million, stops some fires taking place, stops some people from continuing that path of decline from heavy drinking into alcoholism, then into prison and finally into hospital, with all the public expenditure involved. If the clause,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
with proper public money behind it, can catch those people and stop their decline, that will mean a saving to the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I welcome the clause, but only if it is properly financed. If it is not, it will be a complete dead duck, and we need not have wasted our time discussing it this afternoon. If it is given money, it will be one of the most ambitious and hopeful parts of the Bill and perhaps of the social programme of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short 25-minute debate we have had is justification of your decision to allow a debate on clause stand part, Mr. Gourlay, because probably for the first time on this Bill we have agreement between all members of the Committee that the Government are doing something good. Clause 5 is, of course, a repeat of the Labour Government's clause 4. I do not make a political point, but, just as clause 4 in the Labour Government's Bill was a timid first step, I think that we all accept that clause 5 in the present Government's Bill is equally a timid first step. I do not think that we should claim for the legislation something that it will not do. That merely discredits Parliament and the legislation that we enact, builds up false hopes and gives people the wrong kind of confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say advisedly that this clause will not solve the problem of alcoholism. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) mentioned the problem of alcoholism, which is directly linked to the provisions of clause 5. It is a growing problem. If I remember the figures correctly, over a four or five-year period the number of people attending outpatients' departments in Scottish hospitals for alcoholic psychosis, cirrhosis of the liver and other alcohol-related diseases rose from about 400 to 14,000. That was due partly to the success of advertising campaigns persuading people to recognise that they had a problem and that help was available if they would ask for it. But it highlighted the extent of the problem that we are seeking to do something about. So first it must be said, as was said of the Labour Government's Bill, that this is a timid first step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to funding. I should like the Solicitor-General to take up three points. First, what discussions have the Government had with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the funding that
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
might be made available for the provision of detoxification centres? I should imagine that there have been some discussions about that with COSLA; I should be very surprised if there had not. I should like to hear about them from the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Solicitor-General raised the question of urban aid. Obviously, if it is possible that detoxification centres could qualify for a grant under urban aid, it is important that such a possibility should be spelled out, so that local authorities know that the possibility existed, and the conditions under which they could qualify for a grant under urban aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point on funding is the possibility of exploring joint funding between the health boards and the social work departments, because alcoholism is both a health and a social problem. There is no good reason why we should not seek to develop the possibility of joint funding between health boards and the social work departments because both are linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the types of places likely to be designated. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), I find that the question of voluntary agencies is wearing thin. I was made aware of that when I was responsible for the previous Bill. Many of the voluntary agencies were not willing to take part in such a scheme, because, rightly or wrongly, they felt that they were being used for a policy being introduced by the then Government and now by the present Government. I should be interested to know whether the anxieties of, for instance, the Church of Scotland moral and social welfare committee have been overcome in this regard and whether it is prepared to have some of its places considered for designation by the Secretary of State. I am also anxious to know the position of the Salvation Army, which is the organisation most deeply involved in such work. I think that we would all want to pay tribute to the marvellous job that the Salvation Army does, not only in this area but in many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of local authority establishment likely to be designated is also very important, and I have no doubt that the Government have given thought to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to the problem, not only of alcoholism, but to that created once it is decided to take a drunken person to a detoxification centre. As we discussed previously, there is no compulsion upon
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
the person to stay. I remember going to Sunnyside hospital in Montrose—I suspect that it is in the constituency of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), rather than in South Angus. A great deal of good work was being done there. But the view was expressed to me by the consultant psychiatrist that there was a problem when someone was referred to him for treatment, because there was no control over that person to ensure that the treatment embarked upon was completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the first to recognise that once we compel a person to remain in a designated place, we are basically turning such places into pseudo-prisons. That is the last thing that we want and what we most want to avoid. Nevertheless, I think that we all recognise that there is a conflict between the need for treatment and the need to ensure that the course of treatment and the need to ensure that the course of treatment is completed in order to give the alcoholic the chance of recovering. I wish to know what thought the Government have given to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all recognise that those suffering from alcoholism—and it is an illness—are a danger to themselves. They are also a great danger to society. To digress for a moment, I was impressed when I went to Sweden to study the way that the Swedes dealt with the problem. They had a sophisticated method, but central to the system was the fact that when a person was taken drunk and incapable from the streets, his name and address was recorded and kept on computer, as was the fact of his having a driving licence or not. It did not matter whether he was driving at the time that he was taken from the street. If it happened a second time, his driving licence was withdrawn on the basis that he was a risk to society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I say that clause 5 is the first timid step—that is not a political point but a recognition of reality—towards what I hope will be a much better and more open approach to alcoholism. If we bring it to the surface and get people to recognise the problem, we can deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that the Solicitor-General can advise the Committee that when a person is taken under a clause 5 removal to a police station, or perhaps even to a prison, and is then removed to a detoxification centre, the procurator-fiscal
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
will know when he receives the report that the person concerned has been removed under clause 5 provisions. As we have said before, that would obviously be of help to the procurator-fiscal in deciding how to proceed with the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), drawing on his experience as reporter to the Lanarkshire children's panel, said that he found a great deal of use in the notes, the social background and other information which was appended, very often by police officers, when deciding whether a case should be referred to a children's panel. I think that we all agree that it would also be a good idea if, in these cases, the procurator-fiscal knew that someone had been removed under a clause 5 removal provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made all these point, I say to the Solicitor-General that we welcome and support the clause. I do not expect him to have answers to everything that I have asked, but I am anxious to have answers to many of the points which I have raised, and I should welcome his agreement to write to me on any points which he cannot answer now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and to the other hon. Members who have contributed to this debate in such a constructive way and welcomed these proposals. I do not wish to appear churlish, but we are embarking on the beginning of an experiment, and many of the questions raised by hon. Members are, in a certain sense, premature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal first with some of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth. Hitherto, there have been no discussions between the SSHD and COSLA, but if COSLA seeks them, discussions will occur. This provision has not yet taken statutory form, and no local authority has worked out what sort of detoxification centres it would have or where it would have them, and so on. Nor, I regret to say, have we reached a stage when the Salvation Army or the Church of Scotland have come to COSLA, the SSHD or the Social Work Services Group and either offered or asked for help. These matters have not yet been entered into. I do not think that that is surprising, but I hope that discussions will take place
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
involving all these organisations. It will essentially be a matter for the SSHD and the Social Work Services Group to set up these detoxification centres for designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked me about finance under urban aid. I am able to tell him that funding is available for rehabilitation facilities under urban aid programmes or inner city reconstruction packages if certain criteria are met, and I understand that a number of projects for alcoholics are already being assisted in this way. That seems to be one source of funds for the establishment of these centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As all hon. Members know, alcoholism is an extremely intractable condition. Even if a person undergoes full treatment, the risks of return and of temptation are always there. The counsel of perfection would no doubt be to have available in every centre for every person picked up, hospitals such as the Andrew Duncan clinic in Morningside Road in Edinburgh which involve vast expense. But we must keep these things in perspective. All expenditure on any health project is prospectively endless, and we have to decide on the scale of what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause, as with that of the previous Government, is to remove the criminal status from people who just get drunk in public and who are addicted alcoholics. That is the first upland at which we are aiming. Whether it can ever be developed so that, as a result of being taken there, a person voluntarily agrees to undergo a cure and hopes for its success, is a matter which we must leave today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the subject of control over alcoholics. This is one of the great difficulties. Once they sober up, they say "I would like to go out and have another drink"; or, halfway through, they say "I have not had one, and I am not keen on this orange juice they keep injecting into to me to give me withdrawal symptoms. I'm off". Opposition Members talk about civil liberties, but even sober alcoholics have civil liberties. Surely we will not detain them and force them to undergo the process, because that is the alternative. It is a very difficult dilemma which I do not underestimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), of course the police would take the person, as a matter of judgment and decision, to the centre. Of course the procurator-fiscal would take into account, and be advised
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
on instruction by the Lord Advocate to take into account, whether the person, when taken there, remained, or merely went out again. The question whether a prosecution should be brought would be raised on such criteria. I have no doubt that chief constables will instruct their forces that a person should be advised—no doubt the staff of these places will be advised—that if they are, so to speak, co-operative they will be treated with more leniency when the matter of prosecution arises. That is the humane and proper approach. I hope that it will humanise this branch of the law, although I do not for a moment pretend to that it will have dramatic effects on alcoholism in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a preliminary point of order, Mr. Gourlay, on which we need a little guidance from you. I need hardly say that clause 6 is a major item, which I fear gives rise to a fairly lengthy debate. Amendments Nos. 70, 71, 72 and 75 are technical and fairly narrow in scope. Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 seem to raise the whole principle of the clause, because they remove from section 20 of the 1975 Act a fundamental provision without which it will be difficult for clause 6 to survive. Should they, therefore, be taken in two separate groups for the convenience of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always amenable to suggestions, but while amendments Nos. 70, 71, 72 and 75 are more or less technical and the Committee can have separate Divisions on them if it so desires, I cannot see that this in any way inhibits the discussion on the main questions raised by amendments Nos. 131 and 132 in the same debate. I do not see the tremendous difficulty about putting the arguments on the two groups of amendments in the same debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trying to be helpful as always, may I say that in a sense amendments Nos. 131 and 132 were put down as probing amendments. I was slightly surprised that they were in order, because even as I put them down I recognised that they removed, presumably, the preliminaries reaching subsection (2), where the provision is set out in more detail. However, they were chosen to be in order by the fount of wisdom. My intention in that case was to use them as probing amendments, and therefore my intervention will be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are introducing in this clause a remarkable departure from the existing theory of the judicial process in this country. With respect, it will be difficult to discuss these amendments narrowly, because they raise the whole question of the nature of our judicial system. This is why the Thomson report says in paragraph 8.09:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some of our witnesses were strongly opposed on grounds of principle to the revival of judicial examination; they thought that it conflicted with the concept of the accusatorial system which operates in this country in that it introduces an element of the 'continental' inquisitorial system into Scottish procedure."</p></blockquote>
One would have no anxiety over the fact that it was continental. We, too, I take it,
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
are part of the continent. But the report is right in saying that it alters an accusatorial to an inquisitorial system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that if we were doing that, it was appropriate for me to enable the Solicitor-General to say why the Government had the same view as the Thomson report. In other words, he could use these probing amendments to outline what gave rise to the view that it was appropriate to bring in this provision. I am trying to help the Committee. If that is done, it will give us a possibility of not treating my amendments as technical amendments, because they are clearly not technical amendments. They remove the whole of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>), down to the end of the page, in which are written a number of provisions which we need to look at in detail. To an extent, that detail can be looked at under subsection (2). If the Government are willing to adopt such a procedure, in order to speed the work of the Committee I shall be prepared almost to leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the question of silence, with the fact that there is the prosecutor only, and above all that we are changing the rules of the game—the 	<i>règles du jeu</i>—to a completely different form. If it would be helpful to the Committee, I should be prepared to move the amendment in that form as a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The selection of amendments has been on the list for some time. If the hon. Gentleman had raised the matter previously, we might have discussed it in more detail. But in view of the situation that we face today, we should proceed along the lines of the present selection. If there are any difficulties, we may get them sorted out. Amendment No. 131 is being moved, and hon. Members may discuss the other amendments at the same time. I think it would make for a better debate if the hon. Member dealt with all those aspects on one issue and then went through them as required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The only thing that worries me is certain other amendments in the next group, amendment No. 73 in particular, for example. It is a key amendment which seeks to confine any questioning at a judicial examination to extra-judicial confessions and not to special defences and the circumstances surrounding the offence. It is in a separate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
group, and it will inevitably again raise a far-reaching general debate. In a sense, it seems that we are likely to raise your wrath, Mr. Gourlay, through no fault of our own, and that worries me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy and willing for amendment No. 73 to be taken with the first group of amendments, or if the hon. Member prefers it, with the second or third group—with amendment No. 154 or amendment No. 134.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the solution will be for one to move amendment Nos. 131 and for us to proceed to debate that with amendment No. 132. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) could recommend to you through your usual channels how he would like his amendment to be taken. I think he has a valid point. Is that a helpful suggestion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot accept that suggestion. We have considered this matter fully before. That was the group of amendments which it was decided should be taken together. But if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) wishes amendment No. 73 to be put with another group, the Chair is more than willing to accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the opinions of yourself and your advisers. I do not wish to delay the Committee. We shall travel hopefully and see how we progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my contribution, which started off as a point of order, became transformed into an explanation which became a moving of my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has moved amendment No. 131?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). It may well be helpful to the Committee if the reasons which he asks for are given at this stage, because he has tabled a number of probing amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can best remind the Committee of a number of relevant facts of law. The first is that until the end of the last century, an
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
accused person was not entitled to give evidence at all, although he was entitled to be judicially examined as such persons as Jessie McLachlan were. In such examination, as we shall see, the answers were written down, but for some reason the questions were not. After that, an accused person was entitled to give evidence, and judicial examination fell into desuetude because a person was able to give evidence. But that reversed the roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, a person could not give evidence, and any evidence that he wished to give could only be by judicial examination, and that person had to give that evidence before he heard what the witnesses in the court had to say. The concept of allowing the accused to give evidence was to allow him to explain or deny, to add to or to subtract from, or to retract, what he had said at judicial examination, or to give his explanation of his position. But it had the added disadvantage that an untruthful person, giving evidence last—as he did—could make his explanation fit in with whatever evidence he had listened to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we moved the advantage from the innocent person to the guilty one. That state has persisted, and I say with great humility—and also great confidence—that a guilty person is more likely to be able to concoct a false defence or spin a plausible yarn if he first has listened to the pitfalls of the evidence. If he intended to say that he was carrying not a knife but a newspaper, or that he was not carrying anything, somebody says that he was carrying a knife, and he says "No, no, it wasn't; it was rolled up photograph that glinted in the light," it is much easier to get round such evidence than it is to say in advance what one's position is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement of warning a person about to reply to a charge is related partly to the fact that he was not entitled—except at judicial examination—to give evidence to explain what he had said, or to deny that he had said it, or to add to it. But that is when a person is in a "hostile" position. In other words, the only witnesses to what he says or denies are himself and the arresting or inquiring officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we have a very different situation when we come to judicial examination. Here we have a completely neurtal position: a judicial examination before a sheriff. It is—I say so with great humility—my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
certain conviction that no innocent person is likely to be convicted by giving a truthful explanation in anticipation of his trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, a guilty person may escape conviction by deciding to withhold his explanation—perhaps for good—until he has assessed the evidence which is before the court and which points to his guilt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there is a member of the Committee who does not wish to protect the innocent and, equally, to convict the guilty. Therefore, as Thomson suggests on page 41—and as the Bill proposes—a person should be judicially examined by simple, open question so that he can state his attitude to the charge against him; state any defence, denial, explanation, or qualified admission. He can state his position. I cannot imagine an innocent man not wishing to state his position. I cannot imagine circumstances in which it would be prejudicial for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the argument of the Solicitor-General. He has said a great deal, but there is one slight snag that occurs to me. Although it would prevent a guilty person from concocting a dubious defence at a later date, does not the hon. and learned Gentleman also see a slight risk? I want to emphasise here that I have no doubt about the probity of the people in charge of the police, but if there were bendable bobbies around it would enable them to see how their cases could be fitted up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot, in the flash of a second, conceive how that could be so. But I suppose it would be possible if an innocent man genuinely said "I was in Committee Room 9 at 6.40 p.m., so I was not robbing the bank at Hyde Park Corner." Thereafter, on reading that judicial confession, I suppose that it is conceivable that a policeman—or 20 policemen—could be corruptly persuaded to say "Not at all. I saw him hanging about at the Royal Artillery monument, casing the joint," for an hour which bracketed 6.40 p.m. I suppose that is conceivable. But if we go into that realm of corruption there is no safeguard that any law can provide against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply concerned about what I know to be a fact, and fear to be a blot on
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
the law of Scotland: that persons who are guilty are able wrongly to obtain an acquittal by not stating their defence in advance of hearing the evidence. If that happens in serious cases—one a year, five a year, or even 100 a year—it is very bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am also following the hon. and learned Gentleman with interest. It seems to be a dangerous line of argument. Would the Solicitor-General, for example, accept that he is nearly arguing for an advocate being able to comment adversely to a jury on a failure to make a reply to a cautional charge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. For the convenience of the Committee—and I hope to its benefit—we have provided a model clause 6 as it would be if all the Government amendments were passed. I hope that has been for the convenience of the Committee and it has been sent to all members as there are a large number of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will see that comment can be made by the prosecutor, the co-accused or the court in the event of a person who is asked a question at judicial examination failing to answer it and then giving the answer to that question at his trial; in other words, reserving the answer until he knows it is one that will fit in with the evidence, when he could have perfectly well have given the answer when he was first asked the question. On the other hand—and this is the valid point raised by the hon. Gentleman—if he says "I put the Crown to its proof. There is no evidence. I need say nothing", and he says nothing at judicial examination or in evidence because he is innocent and the Crown cannot prove otherwise, no comment can be made on the fact that he does not open his mouth either in reply to caution and charge or at judicial examination or that he chooses not to go into the witness box when the time comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that suffices as an explanation of the justification of judicial examination, we hope, to safeguard against false defences and, secondly, of course, we hope, to obtain more timeous, sensible, accurate and rational pleas to save jurors, witnesses and all concerned their time, trouble and patience. That, of course, is a subsidiary matter; the principal purpose—and I hope this will satisfy the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
Buchan)—is to ensure that a person has an opportunity to state his position at the first possible moment and, secondly, to enable that person at the first possible moment to admit or deny any extrajudicial confession, reply, statement or other comment which he has made. That will also be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, I am afraid, will be a complicated debate because there is a plethora of amendments, many of which overlap, as I said earlier. I shall do my best to help the Committee by not knowingly and perversely ploughing ground which has already been canvassed at an earlier stage—if one can canvas ploughed ground, which I doubt when I think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear the Solicitor-General when he is most humble, and I regard with some suspicion the argument that he put forward in his best court room style. I felt a little like a jury member as I watched his foot going up on the chair and the elegant lean on the thigh. However, despite the style, I was not entirely convinced by the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage—I think it was on Second Reading—I said that I thought that judicial examination was beguiling. I believe that was the word I used. I think that it is a beguiling and plausible concept and, of course, it was endorsed by Thomson, and there is a substantial argument for it. We would be very silly if we did not say that. But as with all these matters, there is a question of balance. If I disagree with the Solicitor-General on where the balance should be struck, I am sure that he will accept that there are arguments on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to concede that, of course, it is an important concept that the aim of the judicial process is to get at the truth and that if men have committed offences, the object of the investigation and, ultimately, the trial is to reveal that truth and, if the facts justify it, to convict and take the necessary action on the behalf of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the force of the argument that a man should be asked at the earliest possible opportunity to state his defence. If he does not do that, there is always the possibility that he will spend the next 109 days if he is in custody, or maybe the next 11 months if he is not in custody, considering how best he can defeat the ends of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit freely, as a solicitor, that I have had clients who have produced on the very day of the pleading diet an alibi ora special defence that, mysteriously, was sadly absent from earlier precognitions that they had given me. I may say—I do not hide it—that on occasions clients have had great difficulty in giving me the names and addresses of the witnesses they assure me exist. People may be horrified, but I think that someone in a tight spot has a natural wish to escape from it; that is human nature. Perhaps we expect too high a standard from that group of people—or any group of people—if we expect them to say "I will take my medicine. I will not try to get out of this tight spot."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General will accept that it is very seldom indeed that such a fake alibi or cobbled-together special defence hoodwinks judge, jury or solicitor. In no case in which I have ever been involved have I ever suspected that a false alibi had succeeded. I have sometimes been troubled because alibis that seemed to me to be extremely solid have not succeeded—but that is another question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there may be a tendency for the great danger to justice of the invented special defence to assume exaggerated proportions. I do not believe that it is as great a danger as it is sometimes said to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The probing amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) seems to me to be very important and to provide an opportunity to rehearse one or two of the arguments. I should like to explain some of my reservations about clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first reservation is a practical one. Anyone who has practised in a sheriff court in Scotland must have the gravest reservations about the practicality of this machinery. Indeed, some of the amendments I have put down, which I will shortly relate to this general theme, constitute an attempt to mitigate the damage. If judicial examination becomes a routine part of the procedure in a jury trial—whether trial by jury on indictment in the sheriff court or a high court trial— we shall run into substantial difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend guide me on this? Will there now be a difference between summary and solemn procedures—the right of silence being available in one but not in the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has made a useful point. I am glad to have been reminded of it. There are very many arguments to be put forward, and I might well have omitted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing in the clause is writing in a double standard. If judicial examination is so important a part of the process, why should it not be introduced for summary trials as well? Clearly it is to be limited to trials, on indictment. If it is so essential, there must be a case for not making the distinction. No doubt the Solicitor-General will have a word to say about that later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West that the Government are limiting the introduction of judicial examination to offences taken on indictment to solemn procedure. I understand that when someone is brought before the sheriff, judicial examination will take place as a matter of routine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As originally envisaged by the Thomson committee—this is an important point and one on which the Solicitor-General may wish to comment—the judicial examination would take place at the first appearance. I shall quote from paragraph 8.13 of the Thomson report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is obviously important that the judicial examination should take place soon after arrest. We have therefore recommended that it should take place when the accused is brought before the sheriff on the next lawful day."</p></blockquote>
I am digressing slightly, but as I understand it, that is not a limitation that the Government have imported into the proposed new section. The new section 20A of the 1975 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the following provisions of this section, an accused on being brought before the sheriff for examination on any charge (whether that examination is the first examination or a further examination) may be questioned by the prosecutor".</p></blockquote>
That suggests that at any point a judicial examination can suddenly be introduced. That implication is strongly reinforced by the complicated and far-reaching amendments which include provision for appeal regarding what happened at the judicial examination. The Solciitor-General will remember that in that provision there are complicated suggestions for handling the situation when the judicial examination takes place so late after arrest that the normal time limits for the procedure Cannot be implemented—the 14 days'
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
notice, and so on—because the trial has already arrived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of Lord Thomson's principal recommendations, that judicial examinatior should take place on the first lawful day, has been abandoned by the Government. Even taking a most enthusiastic view of the proposals, I think that an early opportunity to put the matter to the test is essential. It seems as plain as a pikestaff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will take place at the first appearance before the sheriff, which is on the next lawful day, but it can take place again, as Thomson anticipated, because a man may make a further statement and may wish to admit, deny, qualify or explain it. The provision is that it will happen on the next lawful day, and the further provision is that it can happen again. If it will in any way foreshorten what the hon. Member has to say, I give him that explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. As it is nearly 7 o'clock, perhaps the hon. Member for Garscadden would find it convenient for me now to interrupt what looks from the encyclopaedia of notes that he has like a fairly major philippic, and move, That the debate be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can you explain, Mr. Gourlay, where we stand? The Solicitor^ General purported to move an open-ended adjournment and not a timed adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall clarify the situation. In an open-ended Committee, such as that in which we are engaged, it is for the Chairman, at an hour he decides, to suspend the Committee for dinner. I was proposing to do that at 7 o'clock. I think that the Solicitor-General anticipated my decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. You said that the sitting could be suspended, but the Solictior-General moved the adjournment of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not accept the motion, because it was not relevant. I suggest that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who has the Floor, proceeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to clarify the position, Mr. Gourlay. Is there a difference between a motion to adjourn the Committee and a motion to move progress? We should like to know the Solicitor-General's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General was trying to be helpful to the Chair in moving that the Committee adjourn for dinner. I have already described the procedure that will take place. I suggest that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden proceeds with his speech until I suspend the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From all that, I deduce that the Solicitor-General had got it wrong. But that is not a matter for extended comment and I shall continue until 7 p.m. No doubt we can then adjourn for a suitable period for refreshment before returning to these important matters.

I am obliged to the Solicitor-General for the first part of his intervention, because I know that it was meant to be helpful. It has elicited the fact that the Government assume, and I underline the word "assume", that judicial examination will take place on the first lawful day, as Thomson recommended. The fact that the statute has been drawn in a way which quite clearly assumes that later judicial examination is possible, is only to encompass a situation in which the accused says "Please sir, please sir, I want to see the nice kind sheriff again and say something further". That is not a very helpful or plausible scenario. I should prefer some sort of limitation, not necessarily the one suggested in amendment No. 70, which is that the examination must take place within 10 days of the accused's first appearance. I should certainly like to have some time limit on judicial examination so that the element of spontaneity will give it some value. I am doubtful about that value, but any value must depend upon that spontaneity, before there has been time for thought, or perhaps, for conspiracy, if we take the prejudiced view of the workings of the accused's mind which lies behind the Solicitor-General's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy the clause has been drawn in this way, even though we have had the Solicitor-General's explanation. I fear that the judicial examination will come up much delayed, and as a result we shall find ourselves in difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend help me? I was not clear about what the Solicitor-General said, and I could not intervene. Is he saying that any future examination of this kind should be in cases only where the accused person has said something to the police? The Thomson committee says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where after a judicial examination has been held there are brought to the procurator fiscal's notice remarks blurted out to the police",</p></blockquote>
he will then
	<br><blockquote><p>"be entitled to require a further judicial examination".</p></blockquote>
Did the Solicitor-General say that the clause restricted any further judicial examination only to that situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the situation—perhaps it is dangerous for me to act as interpreter for the Solicitor-General because we might both deplore the duty thrust upon me—the Solicitor-General said that it was the Government's intention, presumably they speak for the Crown Office, that judicial examination as recommended by Thomson should take place on the first lawful day after arrest— that is, at the first appearance—except, of course, if the unfortunate was picked up on a Friday, and therefore had to wait until the Monday when he would presumably make his judicial examination. Or, if we start taking indictments in Glasgow district court, the judicial examination might be on a Saturday because of the interesting dispute which is presently raging in that area, but I will not be tempted into that by-way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the examination shall be on the first lawful day. The provisions in the Bill that would allow judicial examination at a very much later stage are there only to allow for where the accused himself says "I want to be judicially examined. I want to appear again before the sheriff." As I understand it, that is what the Solicitor-General envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Shylock once said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Tis not in the bond".</p></blockquote>
I cannot see it in the clause; it is not so recommended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point which I am making. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I should like to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
see this tightened up. But the phrase that I am objecting to is on page 6, at the beginning of new clause 20A:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an accused on being brought before the sheriff for examination on any charge (whether that examination is the first examination or a further examination)".</p></blockquote>
Now the further examination, as I understand the Solicitor-General, would be the one which was initiated by the accused person, and would not be a delayed action by the fiscal—a second bite of the cherry because he was not satisfied that he had got sufficiently incriminating replies at his first attempt. My difficulty is that I recognise the good intentions of the Solicitor-General. Unfortunately, he cannot stand at the shoulder of every junior fiscal in the land. I fear that the second bite of the cherry may in fact creep in, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
of the loose way in which the clause has been drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say with great respect to the hon. Gentleman that he has got the matter slightly wrong. For instance, if the accused made a further statement it would have to be brought before the court for admission or denial. If the hon. Gentleman reads the Bill he will see that the procurator-fiscal is not entitled to ask the same questions twice in the hope of getting a different answer, so the safeguard that was put in in another place would apply equally to a second examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
