	<p>[MR. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [	<i>LORDS</i>]</h1></div>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DETENTION AND QUESTIONING AT POLICE STATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. In your provisional selection of amendments you have given amendment No. 138 as the first amendment the Committee should consider. I would respectfully ask you to consider whether you could link with that amendments Nos. 152 and 153.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 152 is a purely consequential amendment with no significance in itself. However, the first half of amendment No. 153 was previously numbered amendment No. 148. The essence of it has already been discussed by the Committee and there is no specific new point in it. The second part of amendment No. 153 relates to the mandatory requirement to inform parents or guardians when a child under 16 years of age is being detained by the police. This is closely related to amendment No. 138, which deals with the question of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no desire to push this matter, but if it was agreeable to the Committee it would seem sensible that the whole question of the position of children under the age of 16 should be taken jointly. If that is agreeable to the Opposition, I hope you would feel able to do that, Mr. Gourlay. If it is not agreeable to the Opposition I have no desire to insist on it. It is a matter which should be done, if at all, by general agreement but it seems a more sensible way of approaching the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. First, it is acceptable that we should take these amendments together and discuss the whole question of children under 16 in a comprehensive way, but the difficulty is that amendment No. 153 does not appear on your selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has not had sufficient time to examine the position. Amendments Nos. 152 and 153 are essentially starred amendments, and, as the Minister has explained, amendment No. 153 incorporates the previous amendment No. 148 which the Committee discussed on a previous occasion. In view of that, there was a feeling that it would be advantageous to the Committee to discuss the two Government starred amendments along with amendment No. 138, for the convenience of the Committee and of the debate. However, if the hon. Gentleman objects, since they are starred the Chair would virtually have to miss them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not objecting, Mr. Gourlay. I am merely trying to find out the background against which the request has been made. We are perfectly happy to take all these amendments together and discuss the whole question of the under-16s in a comprehensive debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. While I accept that we should take these new amendments, I am concerned that they have been tabled so late, because it makes it difficult for us to study them and understand their full meaning. They are rather different to the amendment put down by my hon. Friend. It makes our job incredibly difficult that the Government should put down amendments as late as this when they knew that an amendment had already been tabled referring to this specific point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but if there is general agreement to overcome these difficulties in the debate I should like to proceed and call amendment No. 138, with which we might discuss amendments Nos. 152 and 153.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I therefore beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 4, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Subsection (1) of this section shall only apply to persons who have attained the age of 16 before the date of the suspected offence.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment stand in the name of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). First, I thank you, Mr. Gourlay, and my colleagues for ensuring that the amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
ment is taken at this stage, which is a great convenience to me and, I understand, gives no inconvenience to my colleagues, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been observed by some of my hon. Friends and by some hon. Gentlemen opposite that on rare occasions I have lapsed into levity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if on this occasion there is not as much of that as usual. I feel strongly on the issue and I wish to make my points as seriously and carefully as possible. Some hon. Members on both sides of the Committee tend sometimes to indulge in opposition for the sake of it. On this amendment there is no hint of that. I and my colleagues feel that this is one of the most important issues in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Under-Secretary of his enthusiasm for 	<i>The Guardian.</i> He has quoted from it on previous occasions and set great store by the leader which suported his own way of thinking. I refer him to 	<i>The Guardian</i> of last Monday, which contained a detailed and presumably accurate report of the Scottish conference of the Conservative Party. It was reported that in the debate on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill four out of five speakers were against the proposals contained in the Bill and many were critical of the attack on civil liberties contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even allowing for some exaggeration in the report—I have had a brief discussion with the Under-Secretary, who indicated that there may be some exaggeration—it shows that there is disquiet. I have experienced this in discussions that I have had with Conservatives—not just with Members of this House, but outwith this House. I do not say that there is outright criticism or a revolution on this issue within the Conservative Party, but I know the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary to be reasonable men and I hope that they will concede that there is some disquiet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked some weeks ago if I would be willing to put forward this kind of amendment. I was not only willing but enthusiastic. The matter has been raised with me by a number of people none of whom, to my knowledge, is a Socialist or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
member of the Labour Party. One of them at least can be identified with political affiliations elsewhere. But they are genuinely concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, not merely because I tabled it along with my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, that this is an important amendment. It allows us to look at how we deal with criminality among young people. I hope that we can have a wider look at that. It also allows us to consider the possibility of developing positive attitudes among young people to the police. I want young people to be positive towards the police and to have some degree of trust in police officers. I welcome the many activities of some our chief constables to encourage policemen to go into schools and develop among young children a trusting attitude to the police. It is important to discuss the attitude of the police to high-spirited young people as well as to those who may be more criminally inclined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways it may seem a surprising amendment. I wondered whether there had been an oversight by the Government with regard to the definition of "person"—and, indeed, and oversight by the previous Government. I wondered whether they meant that children should be included in the detention provision. I wondered whether this was the intention of both Governments, because "person" is often equated in people's minds to "adult person", and there may have been some misunderstanding about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask members of the Committee to look at what this means in practice, to consider what the detention of children actually means. My understanding is that the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is 8, which means that at the age of 8 and over young people are considered to be responsible for their acts and to be accountable for their criminal acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I ask hon. Members to consider that a 9-year-old person, or an 11- or 12-year-old person, can be detained by the police. I ask whether that person will understand what is happening to him, whether he will understand the nuances of what is meant by his detention and his rights in being detained. Will a 9- or 10-year-old child understand the difference between detention and arrest? That child can then be questioned, alone, if the provisions of the Bill as it is currently drafted go through. He—a 9-year-old-child—can be questioned on his own in the police station,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
with all the grown-up, forbidding, frightening policemen around him. He can be searched, under the present provisions of the Bill. His fingerprints can be taken, or any other prints, as we found out on Tuesday. Reasonable force can be used against that 9-year-old child, and his parents have no absolute right to be informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden points us to amendment No. 153. He is quite right. I welcome the fact that the Government have moved some way towards us. This is one of the crucial elements in the area that we are discussing, but it is not our only concern. I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden who quoted Lord Cooper the other day as saying that detention in the presence of a number of policemen in uniform, including some of high rank, could constitute frightening circumstances for an adult. How much more frightening those circumstances are for a young child. Imagine the effect that such an experience would have on an innocent child. As I said on a previous occasion, many innocent people will be detained, and if these provisions apply to children, many innocent children will be detained. How will that experience condition their attitudes towards the police? How can we expect that such a child can ever again have positive attitudes towards the police? As I said earlier, there is genuine concern about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that some hon. Members have today received a letter from the secretary of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels. I was approached by Mrs. Helen Millar, the chairman of the Strathclyde Children's Panel, who is very concerned about this provision in the Bill. I understand that Mrs. Helen Millar is not of my own political persuasion, but that she is an active and enthusiastic member of the Conservative Party. I forgive her for that, because in this area she is a very active and well-respected chairman of the Children's Panel for half of Scotland, and I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will give serious consideration to her views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been approached by the Secretary and the vice-chairman of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels. The vice-chairman, who worked in a drop forging establishment in Ayr, was talking informally with my colleague about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
drop forging industry. It is a hard industry, and the people who work in it are knowledgeable about other aspects of life. Mr Stevenson, the vice-chairman of the Association, who is not a namby-pamby man, is concerned about the way in which children might be dealt with under this provision. The secretary, who has written to some hon. Members, is herself the wife of a solicitor, and is aware of the legal procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An hon. Member</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no Press Association here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not going to pick up these asides too much today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people stress the importance of parental co-operation in dealing with criminality and potential criminality amongst young people. They point out that referrals to children's panels have declined in the last three years. Some of the cynics may say that this is because the police have less faith in the ability of the children's panels to deal with the cases referred to them. The evidence does not support that. The evidence supports the fact that the children's panels are being successful, and that some of the people with whom they have been dealing—treating, not punishing—have not been coming back into criminal activity as much as they have done in the past when dealt with by different systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the strong views of people who are active in dealing with young people who have broken the law in Scotland. I would like to ask the Minister specifically about the consultation that he has had on this aspect of the Bill. I understand that representations have been made to him, or perhaps to his officials, about this, and I should be glad if he could say whether the Scottish Association of Children's Panels, to which I referred earlier, the Reporters Association, the Association of Directors of Social Work and the British Association of Social Workers have made representations to him. My information is that they are all in favour of the kind of amendment which I suggest today. I understand that some sympathy was expressed by some of the officials within the social work field, who have responsibility for this matter at a national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will try to anticipate some of the criticism that may arise from the Minister, or from hon. Members opposite, about what we are suggesting today. It may be suggested that police would not use these
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
powers against children, and that it is inconceivable that any policeman would ever use the powers of detention on a 9, 10-or even an 11-or 12-year-old child. Why, then, should Parliament enact such powers? Is it not ridiculous for us to enact powers that we know will not be used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it not be taken as the wish of Parliament that the powers should apply to young people if we do not pass the amendment? Will it not be accepted that hon. Members of this House have agreed that these powers should apply to young people and to 9-year-olds? I understand that the reason why we are going through these provisions in Committee in such detail is so that we can consider this kind of issue, and whether the provisions should apply to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested to me—and in the light of recent events in Hampden it is not inappropriate—that many of the football hooligans with whom the police have to deal are under the age of 16, and, therefore, that it is important to enact these powers to deal with young people. I should have thought, having seen the incidents on television and spoken with people who were there, that the question of detention was not so relevant, because arrest was obvious for those who had manifestly broken the law. There was no need to detain; it was clear that they could just be arrested. The question of detention did not arise. Even if detention was relevant in certain circumstances, it would not solve the underlying problems that create football hooliganism, and that is something that, no doubt, we can talk about in more detail when we come to some of the specific clauses referring to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been asked: why 16? The Minister and his colleagues have answered this in putting that age in themselves in amendment No. 153. All the people to whom I have spoken think it is an appropriate age. It is the school-leaving age approximately, and it is an age which, for other purposes, is accepted in similar contexts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be asked: how do we tell that they are 16? That is becoming increasingly difficult to do. I find that with advancing years myself it is much more difficult to tell the age differences between young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had better be pretty careful about his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
approaching senility if it is girls about whom he is wondering whether they are 16 or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been particularly aware of that aspect of the problem. It is the case that girls might well be suspected of criminal acts and come under this provision as well. That supports the view that it is difficult in all circumstances to tell the ages of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a problem, and I do not think we can get round it. All members of the Committee will agree that this is an inherent problem and is included in other legislation where ages are mentioned. With regard to the licensing laws, we know the difficulties that publicans have in assessing the age of people and whether they are above or below 18, and no doubt there are many other examples which hon. Gentlemen who are members of the legal profession and my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden could quote. We must come to some decision about this and accept that there are problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, it may be said that my amendment is too sweeping. I do not think so. We have to decide quite clearly whether we want these provisions to apply to young people, to people under the age of 16, to children; whether we want to stress the importance of parental responsibility. It may be that amendment No. 153 goes some way at least towards one of the points that I was dealing with. It shows, I must concede, a very helpful and positive attitude on the part of the Government, but it does not deal with many of the other aspects—with the powers of search of young people, with the powers of fingerprinting these children, with the frightening experience that these children will undergo even if their parents are informed immediately but before they arrive at the police station. It does not deal with all these points. Therefore, my amendment is the right way of dealing with it. There is in existing legislation enough power to deal with young people under the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am willing, and my hon. Friends are willing, to look at amendment No. 153 to see if that is the way forward and to encourage the Minister and his colleagues to suggest other amendments which might, more appropriately and in a more detailed way, deal with some of the points I have raised. I would ask the Minister to remember that under the present powers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
contained in the Bill detention will be a frightening experience for young people. It will undermine the community work done by police with young people in schools and elsewhere. It will undermine the work of the children's panels that have been built up painstakingly over the last decade. It will undermine the position of parents and the importance of building up parental responsibility. I hope the Minister will accept the good intentions and the sincertiy with which my hon. Friends and I move this amendment and that he will deal not just with the question raised in amendment No. 153 of informing the parents but the other aspects that worry us over the detention of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I at this stage indicate to the Committee that with the agreement of the Opposition, of whatever political complexion it is, I shall be tabling a sittings motion on Thursday to allow for afternoon sittings of the Committee after the Whitsun recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the important amendment of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). I accept without any qualification the sincerity with which he moved the amendment and his concern for the matters under discussion. I ask him to accept that not only the Government but the police themselves feel just as strongly about the importance of the most proper and appropriate care and attention whenever any child is involved in possible criminal activity, where the police have to make contact with that child, where a child has to be held at a police station for any period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new problem for the police. For example, at the moment when the police arrest a child or a child comes voluntarily to a police station, exactly the sort of problems to which the hon Gentleman has referred inevitably arise. Over the years, the police, who are very conscious of the difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, have developed procedures for ensuring not only that youngsters are notified and that all appropriate steps are taken to ensure the minimum of problems of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this both as a general point and also because certain of the more alarming observations of the hon. Gentleman appear to suggest that, with a child in their custody in a police station, the police would do all sorts of alarming things to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
that child in a way that would be gruesome, unfortunate and indefensible. Let me stress that the police over the years have had plenty of opportunity to have children in their effective custody in a police station without circumstances of this sort arising. To that extent, this is not a new situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would seek to prevent in all circumstances the powers under clause 2 being utilised in the case of potential offenders under the age of 16. There was no such qualification in the previous Bill that Parliament considered. In fact, I do not think that I can even recollect the subject being discussed. I may be wrong about that, but certainly there were no representations to the previous Government and I do not recall any member of the Committee either on Second Reading or during the Committee stage raising this as an important point and certainly not making the somewhat alarming observations that the hon Gentleman for South Ayrshire made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I am entitled to make that point, because if the change involved was as fundamental as is being suggested, it is remarkable that no such observations were made at that time or at any time over the years since Thomson report recommended. They have been made only over the past few weeks by the couple of groups mentioned. That does not mean that the points have to be ignored or ought not to be considered. I simply say that when we consider how fundamental a change is envisaged, it is worth while making the point that the subject had not been raised until relatively recently, although there would have been plenty of opportunity to do so when the previous Bill was going through Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That I will accept, but what I find curiouser and curiouser is that this last-minute amendment comes in after the point has been raised, after the letter has been received from the Association of Children's Panels. Yet surely if the Government Departments had been giving full consideration to all the implications of the Thomson report on police procedures, one of the obvious things to have considered was its relationship to the existence of such things as the children's panels. I find it curious how swiftly in the Lords and here the Government bring in amendments to things that one would have thought would have been absolutely

basic to original thinking. It worries me a great deal that, despite the fact that this is the second version of the Bill after a year, the Bill remains incredibly half-baked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. What the hon. Gentleman is saying, although he does not clearly realise it, is that a Bill once presented by Government to Parliament should never be amended by the voluntary choice of the Government because that would be an indication that they had not thought out the Bill properly in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should come to terms with this. He is saying either that Bills can only reasonably be amended when the Government are defeated and amendments are pushed through against the Government's wishes or that, if the Government seek to improve a Bill because representations have been made or because points have been argued, that will always suggest that the Government had never thought it out in the first place. That is not doing credit not only to the present Administration but to every Government over the last 50 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I am saying nothing of the kind. I am saying that in this situation—we have seen it exemplified in other situations—it is one thing when Ministers say "That is a serious matter and we must consider it", but it is another thing when, for the first time apparently, they are confronted with perfectly simple and obvious amendments which they accept on the spot. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is this. We are bringing in measures which change dramatically all the police procedures, leading up to and including the new principle of the judicial examination. It seems incredible to me that the Minister can now stand up and say that this aspect of the matter has not been considered. I do not understand how this could happen. That is what astonishes me—not that he should not be willing to accept amendments, but that such a serious and involved matter as this has not been considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I do not accept that we are making sweeping new changes. What we are doing is regularising existing practice, not providing for fundamental new practices. Secondly, I must point out that the Thomson Committee in all its weighty documents made no reference to this point. The previous Government did not have it drawn to their attention, nor did they consider it. Indeed, it is only in the past couple of weeks that even those bodies which have a particular interest in the position of children have sought to make recommendations. If bodies such as the children's panels organisation—which existed a year ago when the previous Bill was being discussed—did not seek to bring it to the attention of the Labour Government then, that is a factor which one is entitled to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister not agree that it is difficult to interpret legislation and to understand the implications of legislation, even for experienced lawyers such as himself? Lay people are very often not in touch. The media—because there is such a welter of legislation—often do not cover exactly what is happening. People cannot get hold of Bills. There was a problem over the number of copies of this Bill that were available. Therefore, it is understandable if some organisations may not have understood the full implications of the proposal when it was first put forward. That does not mean that these representations are any less relevant now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the last remark of the hon. Gentleman, but he must appreciate that the proposals relating to detention were not just published six months ago; they were published a year and a half ago by the previous Government. Therefore, this is a factor I am entitled to take into account. I make that point, and I see no reason to depart from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now return to the actual merits of the amendment, as clearly it is right that they should be considered properly and fully. The first point the Committee should consider is the extent to which children are actually involved not just in minor acts of bad behaviour but in criminal activity in Scotland. Clearly, if children were hardly involved in criminal activity at all and it was just a question of children misbehav-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
ing who might become the subject of these powers, that might have a substantial influence on the Committee's view as to the appropriateness of the amendment before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I would refer the hon. Member for South Ayrshire to the criminal statistics, which do not make particularly cheerful reading. It gives me no great pleasure to make the quotations I am about to make from them but it is necessary that the Committee should be aware of the very serious extent to which children under the age of 16 have been involved in responsible for not just petty acts of bad behaviour but serious criminal activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to the publication "Criminal Statistics Scotland 1978", which gives the latest figures available. On page 27 in paragraph 5.6 it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The number of reports on children for crimes in 1978 represented one in four of all crimes cleared up in that year".</p></blockquote>
One quarter of all crimes cleared up in that year were crimes that were apparently committed by children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Crimes, not offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As my hon. and learned Friend points out, these were crimes, not offences. In the actual statistics we have a breakdown of the sort of matters we are talking about. In Table 5.2—"Initial Reports on Children, by Crime and Offence, 1978" we find that in crimes against the person—clearly the most important crimes—761 children were involved. In housebreaking and robbery 7,718 were involved; in theft reset 11,611; in damage to property 1,012; in forgery 11, and in other crimes, 143. "Total crimes" were 21,256 and "Total crimes and offences" 31,535.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are not talking about minor matters, involving a few children, that the Committee and the country should not take seriously. We are talking about one in four of all crimes, and a total of 31,535 crimes and offences that apparently were believed to have been committed by children. We cannot ignore that when determining whether the proposed power should or should not apply to those under the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Gentleman can paint lurid details about 8 or 9-year-old children
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
being dragged to the police station against their will, he knows perfectly well that that is not how the procedure operates with the present irregular procedures and not how it would happen in the future if these procedures were regularised. It is the normal practice of the police, whenever appropriate, to ensure that, for example, parents or guardians are informed. If they do not know who are the parents are or cannot contact them, they regularly contact a headmaster or someone who can be though to be 	<i>in loco parentis,</i> to ensure that they are properly informed. It is by no means unusual for parents to be present when questioning takes place—though that is not always appropriate, as the hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree, because sometimes the crimes may involve the parents as well as the children. Clearly, therefore, that could not be made an automatic or statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the police are more sensitive than the hon. Gentleman seems to appreciate to the problems and difficulties that can arise if a child is by himself in the presence of police officers. He does not seem to have taken that point on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered carefully the observations of the children's panels chairmen's group and the Scottish Association of Children's Panels. They had a meeting with officials of my Department to discuss this and the Government's view is that, because of the serious involvement of youngsters under 16 in criminal activities, it would not be appropriate simply to leave any possible criminal activity by them to the irregular procedures presently undertaken. At the moment adults and youngsters are the subject of irregular procedures in being invited to the police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to regularise the position for adults, it is illogical and unsound to argue that we should not regularise it for children. The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that if his amendment is accepted and the police had no powers to detain youngsters, it would not stop youngsters from going to the police station. The situation would be the same as it is now. A youngster of, say, 12 or 13 whom the police believed had been involved in a crime or an offence would be told "Come on laddie. You are coming to the police station." He would volunteer, as it were, to go. The hon. Gentleman did not address himself to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it might, however, be appropriate to regularise things in a different way for children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the subject of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. He has not put forward any specific proposals with that in mind. If he has any thoughts on that, clearly we shall be happy to hear them and see the strength of the points that he makes. But, in one respect, we have already conceded that by amendment No. 153. It proposes that if a youngster under 16 is detained in a police station, there should be no possibility of his parents or guardian not being informed by the police at the earliest opportunity. That is clearly a distinction between children and parents, for reasons which are so self-evident that I do not need to expand on them. They will be acceptable to both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will see that amendment No. 153 is expressed in slightly qualified terms—not for reasons of principle but because of the practical situation. Clearly, there will be occasions when the child simply refuses to tell the police who his parents are or where they can be found, and the police will not have the power to carry out what is required of them. Sometimes, even if the parents and their address are known, they may not be at home and it may be difficult to contact them for perfectly acceptable reasons. But the intention of the amendment will commend itself to the Committee—that the police will, where possible, contact the parents or guardian as soon as possible to inform them of the child's detention or arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels, Mrs Margaret Tait, states in her letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish you to consider the following amendment to this clause namely that, if the person is a child under 16 years of age…there will be a duty on the police to make every available effort to contact the child's parents and to inform them of his whereabouts."</p></blockquote>
That is the Association's specific request in a letter dated 12 May. Within hours the Government responded to that request by tabling the appropriate amendment, and I understand that when Mrs Tait was informed on the telephone by one of my officials of our intention to put down such an amendment, she understandably expressed substantial satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
I hope that in these circumstances, and with the general background that I have indicated to the hon. Gentleman, he will appreciate that, certainly in the light of the amendment which the Government have put down—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal of confusion about the amendment. Will the Under-Secretary explain what is meant by subsection (2)? By the way, where is subsection (1)? There is no subsection (1) in clause 3. Second, subsection (2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the person mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) above".</p></blockquote>
We are simple souls. Will the Under-Secretary please explain it to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 147 inserts "(1)" Only subsections (3) and (4) of amendment No. 153 relate to the question of children. Subsection (2) is not concerned specifically with the position of children, but provides that where a person requests intimation to be made to his solicitor, or to his relatives, that the time should be recorded when that request is made, and when it is complied with. That does not apply specifically to children, it applies to any person. The hon. Gentleman may recall the point that the Committee has agreed, that the suspect should be specifically informed of his right to have intimation made to his relatives or his solicitor, and it was thought appropriate by the Committee that the times at which this happened and was complied with should be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the light of my remarks and the specific amendment which I have put down—which has been welcomed by Mrs Tait of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels—the hon. Member for South Ayrshire will agree that it is better that the existing practice should be regularised, and that it would be inappropriate if, when the position for adults had been regularised, an irregular and unsatisfactory situation was allowed to continue for those under the age of 16. For these reasons I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate, and I know that the Under-Secretary is anxious to acknowledge that. I do not say this in any carping criticism, but it is a little unfortunate that amend-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
ment No. 153 was tabled so late. There has been extensive correspondence on this subject with a number of interested bodies, running for some months. There is a phrase in the children's panel letter to which we have been referring which illustrates that point. Mrs. Tait says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may wonder why I am writing to you. Our association has already made representations through the Scottish Office, but I gather that these have been unsuccessful."</p></blockquote>
For a number of months to my personal knowledge there has been discussions about this. Although I make not too big a point of it, like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) I have anxiously trying to disentangle the mysterious appearance of subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>) and trying to make sure that I understand exactly what is involved in amendment No. 153. I have some questions of importance about that, to which I shall come in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that we have had this debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) for putting down this amendment, to which I added my name. It allows us to look at the very important area of the inter-reaction between the age group under 16 and the police. Although I do not necessarily accept as gospel the report in 	<i>The Guardian,</i> I am aware that at the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Perth a good deal of anxiety was responsibly expressed, particularly on this point, the powers of detention, and juveniles under the age of 16. The chairman of that rare organisation, a Conservative constituency association in the West of Scotland that returns a Conservative Member, was among those who specifically expressed anxiety from the platform on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also refer in passing to the document on children's panels, the discussion document that has just been issued. As someone who was once concerned in the children's panel system professionally, I greatly welcome not necessarily the specific proposals contained in that document but the recognition in the preamble from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that the children's panel system has established itself as an integral part of our legal system and our system of treating the juvenile offender and is doing extremely valuable work. I make that point because so often, particularly, if I may say so, sometimes in Con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
servative circles, the children's panels are seen as unpleasant soft options, failures and the worst sort of do-goodery. I find it very reassuring that in the Government's discussion document there is a total and unambiguous acceptance that the children's panels are valuable and successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that arose on the question of clause 2 and the juvenile offender was whether clause 2 applied at all to the juvenile offender. I had circulated to me, and I am sure other members of the Committee also did, some extremely interesting correspondence between Mrs. Helen Millar and a number of people including Mr. Roddie McGregor who is the reporter to the children's panel in Strathclyde region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. McGregor was invited by Mrs. Millar to consider whether someone under the age of 16 could be detained in terms of clause 2, and in his letter of 22 February he took the view that they probably could not be. He founded on the phrase which we find in clause 2(1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment".</p></blockquote>
Mr. McGregor, no doubt having taken advice from the legal experts in the Strathclyde region and those involved in his own department, came to the conclusion that "punishable by imprisonment" could not apply to juveniles because juveniles could not be imprisoned. It is quite clear that the powers under clause 2 could not be used on someone who had not yet reached his sixteenth birthday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The situation would therefore appear to be clear-cut … unless Parliament in its wisdom introduces different legislation."</p></blockquote>
At least, it is clear from what we have heard from the Minister and discovered subsequently that Mr. McGregor, who is a very senior official in the system and who obviously gave consideration to the point, is wrong in his assumption that it could not apply to a person under 16. Maybe the point about imprisonment will be commented on by the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 relates to the offence being punishable by imprisonment, not necessarily the offender. There-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
fore, it is the nature of the offence that determines whether the power of detention can be used, not the particular personality or identity of the individual person suspected of committing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having read the letter and being initially impressed by its ingenuity, I had been driven to the conclusion that it was invalid, but I use it merely as an instance of the fact that in very responsible places there was an assumption which perhaps was coloured by the wish, if I may say so, that this clause should not apply to juveniles. Anyway, it would appear that we now have the situation where it does apply and it is the Government's intention that it should apply, and what we have to decide is whether that is a situation which we should allow to continue or whether there are other amendments that we can bring in, whether the new amendment No. 153 is adequate in terms of safeguards, whether it should be strengthened or whether we should not look with genuine consideration and care at the amendment that stands in the name of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is common ground in the Committee that we cannot just rely on the system of work in the police force. The Under-Secretary rather unfairly rebutted what he described as the horrific catalogue of possibilities which was outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. Frankly, I thought he was merely reading the text of the Bill contained in clause 2(5) in terms of fingerprinting, searching and so on. But in rebutting that the Under-Secretary spent some time suggesting that we should not presume that horrific things happened. I agree that very seldom do horrific things happen, but the system is open to abuse and we are not in a situation where we can rely heavily upon just a system of working, however much the police may try to enforce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that in the same batch of correspondence that was circulated there was a letter from the Scottish Home and Health Department to Mrs. Murchieson, who is the chairman of the Children's Panel in Inverness, from a Mr. J. T. Williamson. I do not know Mr. Williamson but he is clearly an official in the Scottish Home and Health Department. He refers to the fact that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the police have developed a code of practice for cases where a child is arrested, and this will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
followed where a child is detained under the proposed powers of Clause 2 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to make the interesting statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is highly unlikely that in such a case"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the detention of a juvenile—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the police would seek to exercise the right to delay notification."</p></blockquote>
The very fact that he has to say that it is highly unlikely but he cannot preclude the possibility suggests that it is very unsafe to rely on working practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the Under-Secretary, amendment No. 153 is a tacit acceptance of that fact. The Government are saying "All right, we want to insist. Hon. Members on this side of the Committee who put down the amendment to exclude juveniles are wrong but we accept that safeguards are necessary". I want to address my mind to whether the safeguards in amendment No. 153 are such as should reassure the members of this Committee and those who work in the children's panels system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to Mrs Tait—I do not know the lady but I am certainly impressed by the energy with which she has pushed her case, which I think is a good one—I am not sure whether on more mature reflection she may not be a little less happy about amendment No. 153 than she was initially. When one receives mysterious phone calls form high personages in the Scottish Office saying that the Minister has caved in, naturally one's initial reaction is gratification. But I think that one must see to what extent the Minister has caved in and whether he has given effectively what is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will consider the letter from Mrs. Tait on behalf of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels dated 12 May he will see that all the writer requests is a right for parents to be notified of the fact of a child's detention. As the amendment meets the request in the letter, it is not surprising that she was quite pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I have been discussing it informally in the last few minutes on these Benches, but I can only tell the Minister that it may well be that the safeguards are not satisfactory. There is a large body of opinion from BASW, from the Glasgow Bar Associa-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
tion, from other members of the Children's Panel with whom I am in contact. I spoke to some reporters this morning before I came to this debate, and I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that if he thinks that the gratification will be both universal and absolute he is in for a very sad disappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at amendment No. 153, one of the things I want to know immediately is what is meant by:
	<br><blockquote><p>"send without delay such intimation".</p></blockquote>
Quite clearly, we have a situation where the child has been detained, has been taken to a police station, and at that stage presumably efforts will be made to contact the parents. In the nature of things—we went over this ground in other contexts—contacting is often a lengthy process. You will remember, Mr Gourley, that it arose in the debate about witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how satisfactory a safeguard this is. The child is detained in, let us say, a peripheral housing scheme. He is then taken in by car to the police station. At the police station it becomes clear that he is a juvenile—that is perhaps the first thing that becomes clear—and he then says that his parents live at such-and-such an address which may be a number of miles away. Intimation must then be sent, presumably in terms of a squad car or a local policeman is contacted at a local office and sent round. At that stage, the police have intimated to the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By that time the child may have been in the police station for a considerable period of time. It may well be that one third of the six-hour period has run its course before intimation has been effected. In that time—I may be wrong—I presume that questioning may have started and the child may have been put under pressure, perhaps unintentionally, perhaps through over-enthusiam on the part of junior police officers, or for any combination of circumstances, perhaps self-induced pressure. But pressure may have built up and the child may have severely compromised himself, perhaps on a totally false basis. As the Minister rightly said, childen are often open to pressure and sometimes do not know exactly what is happening in terms of distinctions, as to their rights and their legal position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the questioning which is allowed under clause 2 start before intimation?
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
That raises the question: will intimation be sent to the parents even if it is not requested by the child? As originally drawn, any intimation under clause 3 of the Bill had to be triggered by a request by the suspect. Presumably it is an unreasonably high standard to expect a child to recognise. He may start bawling for his mammy. But I suspect that many of them will do nothing and will not specifically ask that intimation be sent. I want to establish that that is an automatic process under statute and not one that has to be triggered by a request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall not be accused of special pleading—though I fear that the suspicion may enter some minds. I am not sure that the intimation to a parent alone is sufficient. Intimation to a solicitor, for example, should perhaps be on the same mandatory basis if requested. The parent might not be sure of his legal rights any more than is his child, and advice from a solicitor might be of immense importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What comes out of all these questions the Minister will not be surprised to hear me say this is the absolutely fundamental one to which the Committee must address itself: whether intimation to a parent is of any value as a safeguard. We are trying to build in protections for a child under 16, in Lord Cooper's sinister venue, in a police station—with all the pressures and confusion that will certainly build up in his mind. If we have safeguards, they must be safeguards that will affect what happens in the police room where the child is being interviewed. The fact that the parent has been told where he is and at some point during the six-hour period has knowledge of what has happened to his child is in no sense a protection or safeguard for the child in the interview room, under pressure from questioning in terms of clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to accept amendment No. 153, it would have to go a bit further. It would have to provide that not only would there be intimation to the parent but that the parent should have a right of access to his child and should be present during any questioning. That might be a good police practice. If one suspected a 14-year-old of a serious offence, one might want his parents to be present when he was being questioned. If it is to be a meaningful safeguard, that protection should be built-in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow Bar Association's memorandum states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>427</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association also believes that a new clause should be inserted providing that in a case of a person aged 17 years or under no questions should u put to him other than those designed to elicit his name and address, until a Solicitor or parent is in attendance".</p></blockquote>
I shall not quarrel about "solicitor" as against "parent". But certainly there should be right of access for a parent, and probably the Glasgow Bar Association is right to say that if a solicitor is approached by the parents he should have a right of access and should be in attendance as well. Otherwise, at the end of the day, is the safeguard not totally illusory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it is important that a parent should know that his child is being detained. But if he cannot get to his child and cannot be present to see that the questioning is fair, does that not mean that we should be going for the shadow of a safeguard rather than the substance in accepting amendment No. 153?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the police would, as a matter of normal practice, have the parents present, how would the hon. Gentleman, if he insisted on a statutory requirement, deal with a situation in which the child was clearly frightened of his parents? The last thing in the child's interests would be to insist on the parents being present because of the nature of the alleged offence, which might involve the parents as well as the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinarily unlikely set of circumstances. If the Minister is saying that we do not need this additional safeguard because it is normal good police practice anyway, that would be an argument in terms of his own speech for saying that we do not need amendment No. 153 at all because it is good police practice to inform parents. But it is right to have amendment No. 153 because in this sensitive area good police practice should be reinforced by statute.

In the even more important matter of access to the child, clearly the same argument should apply. If there was a quite extraordinary situation—though I cannot envisage it—where the child did not wish to see his parent, I have no doubt that could be dealt with by drafting an amendment, or if the parent refused to exercise his right when it was offered to him, the right could fall. I think it is an important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
safeguard, and one that we should insist on if we are to accept amendment No. 153.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this not in a carping spirit, because I was impressed by the argument of the Under-Secretary that it might be dangerous in terms of juveniles to go back to the situation where there was no power of detention at all. I think there is a case in this area for the power of detention if it is genuinely and properly regulated. I think there is a possibility that that argument could be made to stick but it would have to be by a very much stronger amendment than amendment No. 153.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have at the moment very special arrangements for the disposal of young offenders. They are not taken in normal adult courts, except in special, defined, categories of cases, so there is differential treatment for the under-16s as opposed to adult offenders. That is reflected in disposal, in sentencing, and also in the method of disposal—that is, in the way that the system deals with them. It seems to me that there is nothing illogical or wrong in having a differential method of treatment at the very important pre-charge investigation stage, which we are now discussing. I would not be frightened of going back to the old voluntary system but I can see an argument that in an area where one is dealing with juveniles the false invitation, if I may put it that way, is peculiarly dangerous, because the under-16-year-olds would be unlikely to have the assurance and knowledge to stand on their rights and say "I don't want to be invited" or "It is an invitation that I wish to decline".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I can see the argument of the Under-Secretary for saying that instead of having a false invitation, which might amount to bundling a juvenile into a police van and taking him along on a very compulsory basis indeed, the compulsory invitation ought at least to be regulated by safeguards. However, if we are to have that argument it seems to me that amendment No. 153 must be strengthened in the way I have indicated. No doubt the Minister has seen that amendment No. 92 to clause 3 has been tabled for discussion later. This would insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any solicitor so informed shall have access to his client at the said police station or other premises for the purpose of giving advice."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any solicitor so informed shall have access to his client at the said police station or other premises for the purpose of giving advice."</p></blockquote>
I think that is an important safeguard for the whole generality of suspects who may be detained under clause 2, but it is particularly important in the case of juvenile offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister before Report could give us an assurance that a right of access to parents, or to parents and solicitor, would be written into his amendment No. 153 I should be much more sympathetic to the idea that we might not go right down the road and exclude juveniles from clause 2 altogether. But without that additional safeguard I think we are clutching at straws in pretending that intimation is a real bulwark against abuse or undue pressure in a police station. In those circumstances I think we would do better to try to insist on our original amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to be brief, But I should like to support fully amendment No. 138 and the points that have been made regarding the weakness of amendment No. 153. The Minister is not inclined to accept amendment No. 138—and one always knows that Opposition amendments have defects in their drafting—but the question is whether amendment No. 153 is a sufficient substitute and, clearly, for the reasons adduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of questions must be asked. First, what sense does the amendment itself make? I find that I and others are still in difficulties regarding the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (1), and we should like that point to be cleared up by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the major point which I raised before. I do not know whether the Minister has caved in on this, as my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden said. Ministers do not cave in; I cave in, my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden makes reasonable compromises. Ministers have it in their minds to get Government measures passed all the time. But I think it is terrible that this whole question was not considered before, and I informed my own Government that that was the case. I think it was partly because people just did not believe it could happen. That was my view. I thought that the provision applied to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
adults with different procedures applying to children, as the handling of children was different through the children's panels and so on. It was only when this question was raised by my hon. Friend that I thought it would apply at this age. But people with the sublety of mind to know that the word "offence" in clause 2 does not include offender would have seen this earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, Thomson was dealing not with children's procedures particularly, but with the general case. We have dealt with children's procedures over the years—the establishment of the children's panels and so on—but it is up to the Government to see the consequences of their actions in interpreting the Thomson report. I find it regrettable that this was not seen a year ago and is seen only now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it sufficient to say that it was seen only when it was raised by representatives from the Scottish Association of Children's Panels because the Glasgow Bar Association also raised the matter. It sent a memorandum and presumably made representations not only to Back Benchers but to the Government. It quite clearly stated that the Association believed that a new clause should be inserted providing that no questions should be put to a person aged 17 years and under other than those designed to elicit his name and address until a solicitor or parent was in attendance. The point had been made, as is now being made by my hon. Friend, in relation to this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to seek these further assurances on the presence of the parent at a stage of the process. I do not agree with the Minister that nothing new and dramatic is happening in our procedure. Something profoundly new and dramatic is happening and we should realise the scale of it, beginning with the detention process. The questioning will begin there. We would seek the presence of a parent while the questioning was going on and, above all, we would seek a solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) spoke this morning with brevity but not with levity, which he says he has been eschewing, but the Minister was guilty of it. Of course, children often say, "Don't bring my parents into it." The common cry of a child picked up in a back garden is, "Don't tell my Mammy". They do not want the parents involved at a certain age. But if it is more serious than that, if there is a real fear of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
the parent, a new issue develops. Something else is required, a welfare officer is required in this situation. If there is such a depth of opposition to meeting the parents the police officer faces new circumstances, and a social worker must be called in quickly. It was a flip comment which was unworthy of a Minister for whom I have a great deal of respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will look again at this. Of course, we welcome any progress that is made. I only regret that so much progress has been made on these matters at such short notice. The conduct in the Lords, while it pleased me, astonished me. A point is made for a quarter of an hour and the Minister stands up and says, "You're quite right; we withdraw all this." The same thing has happened here. I wish they would drop the Bill because they certainly have not thought it through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn first to the question of the timing of these amendments being put on the Order Paper. It is fairly obvious that amendments appearing at this late stage, and selected more or less by agreement between both sides of the Committee, is not the most satisfactory way to proceed. I say this because I want to put on the record that we will want to return to this matter on Report, and, as an Opposition, we will want to put down amendments to amendment No. 153 in order to strengthen it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying that at this stage because I hope, although I have no say in the selection of amendments on Report, that consideration will be given to the fact that these amendments have been tabled almost overnight and that that has given us no oportunity to amend them. We are therefore entitled to expect that when we come to the Report stage the amendments that we put down in this respect will be selected for debate. We are dealing here with an important subject. Mrs. Margaret Tait may well be delighted with herself this morning that she has caused this debate to take place and these amendments to be put down. I am not so certain that once Mrs. Tait reads the debate that has taken place in the Committee she will be convinced that she has got what the Scottish Association of Children's Panels asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, she has not got what the association asked for. Let me explain to the Minister why he has not met the point
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
which the association made. I quote from paragraph 2 of the letter which the Minister in now holding in his hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs. Margaret Tait says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish you"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Members of the Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consider the following amendment to this clause namely that, if the person is a child under 16 years of age that is being detained in a police station or other premises under Secton 2 of the Bill,"—</p></blockquote>
this is the important point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"there will be a duty on the police to make every available effort to contact the child's parents and to inform them of his whereabouts."</p></blockquote>
Whatever else amendment No. 153 does, it certainly does not impose any duty on the police to inform the child's parents of the child's whereabouts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly pointed out, the whole subsection contained in amendment No. 153 is triggered off not by any duty placed on the police, but by the request made by the person who is detained. Once that person is advised by the police, when he arrives at the police station, of his rights to have someone informed, he might well not ask to have anyone informed. The Minister in an intervention when my hon. Friend was speaking made precisely that point. There might be cases where the child did not want his or her parents informed, and therefore the police would not be under any obligation to inform them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must stress that the hon. Members for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing} and Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) are under a misapprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So was the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police under the terms of the amendment will be under an absolute duty to inform the parents, wherever possible, of the detention of that child. Only in the case of those above the age of 16 will intimation depend on a request from the person detained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 153 does not make that clear. If that is the purpose of the amendment, it alleviates many of my worries about it, but that does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
meet the point that it does not make the purpose clear. I hope that the Minister will now say that he will come back on Report with further amendments to amendment No. 153 in order to make that clear. Even the Minister said that my hon. Friend and I were under a misapprenhension, or did not understand the subsection, but from the Ministers intervention in my hon. Friend's speech the Minister showed that he did not understand that the police were under an obligation, whether the child wanted it or not. The police are under an obligation whether the child wants them to or not, to inform the parents. I take it that that is the meaning of the subsection, that the child cannot say to the police, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire West (Mr. Buchan) says, "Don't tell my mammy", but the police will go and tell his mammy whether the child wants them to or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that or is it not the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position. If the hon. Gentleman will check the record when it is eventually printed, he will see that the intervention I made to his hon. Friend was not is regard to intimation to parents but as to the question whether parents should be present in the room where the child is being questioned during the period of detention. It was in relation to that and that alone that I indicated my view that the child in certain circumstances might not wish the parents to be present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hopeful that the Minister would also say that he would come to the Report stage with further amendments to make this subsection abundantly clear. Whether the Minister likes it or not, the subsection as it now reads does not place any duty on the police to inform a child's parents of the child's whereabouts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to another point which I should like the Minister to take up. There is a very important and subtle difference between the wording used in The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 and the wording used in this subsection. Anyone reading this subsection reads it in conjunction with subsection (1) which is still to be remembered as a result of the amendment to which the Minister referred. Anyone reading it would read it in the context of the intimation being given to the child's parents as a result of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
the child making the request in the same way as an adult detainee or an adult person who had been arrested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that that is not the case. I am pleased to hear that. But the clause does not make that clear and we shall need to come back to that on Report to make this abundantly clear. That would resolve many of the doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are essentially talking at this stage about a drafting matter. I am quite happy to undertake to look at the drafting and if, as the hon. gentleman fears, it is indeterminate from the drafting whether that is the intention, obviously an amendment would be required. I have no reason at the moment to believe that it would be and therefore I cannot give an assurance that there will be an amendment on Report, but I will certainly have the drafting reconsidered to see if there is any ambiguity. It is certainly the intention in regard to intimation that it should be an absolute duty on the police to intimate to parents wherever possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that. His assurance is very good news. But I must repeat that, if the Minister does not see the need for a further amendment, we would see the need to make this subsection a little more explicit, and would want it amended on Report. So no doubt we will come back to that on Report. We shall not resolve the problem today because we have not had the opportunity to amend these overnight amendments that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To get this matter clarified, the hon. Gentleman has really been looking at amendment No. 153. He will recall that this is being considered with amendment 152. If he re-reads amendment No. 152, he will see that it specifically states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after 'who' insert, 'not being a person in respect of whose custody or detention subsection (3) below applies—'"</p></blockquote>
That phrase makes it abundantly clear that the requirement for the suspect to request intimation does not apply in the case of children. That is the effect of amendment No. 152.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the matter becomes more complex as we go on. Subsection (3) is fairly all-embracing. I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
need to quote it. Every member of the Committee has the order paper before him. The whole subsection does not refer to the child. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person who has been arrested and is in such custody as mentioned"</p></blockquote>
The words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that subsection appears to him to be a child"</p></blockquote>
are the only qualification in that whole subsection. My understanding of the rest of subsection (3) is that it does not apply to children. It applies to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"person who has been arrested … as is mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) above".</p></blockquote>
The whole of subsection (3) does not apply to children. It is only that part of subsection (3) which specifically mentions "child". The debate that we are having clearly illustrates the difficulty in which the Committee has been placed by these overnight amendments. The amendments are not specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->: 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish the sentence. We shall not resolve the matter today because the Opposition did not have time to consider and amend these amendments. We really must return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying, Mr. Gourlay, without in any way trying to interfere with the selection of amendments for Report, that I hope that, when consideration is given to that selection, there will be within the memory of those responsible the difficulty in which the Opposition have been faced on this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much point in arguing with what my hon. Friend has said. I am merely asking what on earth paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) are. I do not think that any of us knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into that. My hon. Friend is like the rest of us. I am no more clear on the matter and I do not think the Minister, from his consultations, is too clear on the matter either. I have a funny feeling that those advising him are not too clear on the matter. The Committee is in utter confusion on this important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
The other point that I intended to raise with the Minister refers to the subtle change in terminology in subsection (3) as distinct from the wording in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. We have made it abundantly clear that the police officer is under a statutory obligation to inform the child's parents, whether the child wants him to do so or not—I cannot emphasise that enough—if the parent or guardian is known. Will the Minister say why the words "if known" were chosen when, in the 1975 act and in all preceding legislation, the words are "if he can be found" It is not just a subtle difference between the phrases "if known" and "if he can be found". I assume that if the words "if he can be found" are used, that means that the police officer has to make an effort to find the parent or guardian. But here we use the words "if known".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry is that it is relatively simple for someone in a police station to say "But he was not known", that would create all sorts of difficulties, which I hope that the Minister will consider. I hope that he will agree to revert to the 1975 wording, "if he can be found". That might be a small point, but, when dealing with such an important matter and seeking to reasure people, he should look at wording which has been used, tried and tested and has obviously succeeded in the past. For the life of me, I cannot see why it should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point—my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden raised a number of meaningful questions—takes me back to the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ii) where he is not arrested, or as the case may be detained, until after such arrival, on such arrest or detention."</p></blockquote>
I know that the Ministers intention is that the period of detention should begin the minute the person is detained, and I take it that he sees no danger of there being read into these words that detention would begin from the time that the detainee arrived at the police station. We have been through this debate already and I am anxious that we should not use words in amendments put down overnight which would create the doubt that the Minister and his colleagues went to the trouble of removing at an earlier sitting, for which I thank them. I hope that he will look at that aspect of his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to another point. I was interested that the Minister was using the crim-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>437</span>
inal statistics for 1978—the last period, the Minister said, for which the statistics were available. It may be a little beyond the bounds of this debate, but it is relevant to ask when the 1979 statistics will be available. If we are discussing juvenile crime—indeed, all crime—we are entitled to expect at least some indication of the trends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My information is that crime in 1979, under the Labour Government, went down by 12½ per cent and that crime in 1980, under the Tory Government, is now climbing almost apace with inflation. I can see this Government with some record at the end of the day: double crime figures, double inflation, double prices, double unemployment. Whatever it is, they have doubled it. We are entitled to ask whether the staff cuts in New St. Andrew's House—and, of course, they will be added to by the Prime Minister's statement the other day that another 75,000 civil servants are to be sacked—will affect the publication of the criminal statistics which in many ways are related to the work of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to produce the criminal statistics overnight, but there is going to be a fairly long period between now and Report. I hope that in the intervening period the up-to-date criminal statistics can be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made all these points, my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who so ably moved his amendment, will obviously make his own decision about what he wants to do about it. But the Minister has come some way—and I do not take that away from him—to meeting the point that was made in the Scottish Association of Children's Panels' letter. From the cross-questioning and answering that has taken place during the debate, we have elicited from the Minister this very important commitment that it is now going to be a statutory obligation on the police to inform the child's parents, whether the child wants the parents informed or not, and that, if the Minister feels that he should amend this on Report to make it more explicit and specific, he will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must repeat that we shall want to consider this matter. At this stage, I have very little doubt that we shall want to put down one or two amendments ourselves on Report to make amendment No. 153 much more explicit and certainly to include a written indication that this is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
statutory obligation, not a discretionary power. We would want that included in writing. We shall come back to that matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on these particular amendments. I always say that at the beginning of every debate, but this time it actually was true until I realised that, if I did not speak, I might annoy my mother-in-law who happens to be a very senior member of a children's panel, having served on such a panel right from the very beginning of the children's panel system. If I do not speak, she might feel that somehow or other I am letting her down—and that would be the last possible thing I should like to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More seriously, I would like to come back to amendment No. 138, because I feel that to some extent the debate has come round to Government amendment No. 153 and has tended to slip away from the original amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). This goes considerably further than the Government's, because it proposed that detention shall not just apply to children under the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on my feet because I want to put on the record that I am opposed to all of clause 2 and to the principle of detention, as it stands, applying to any person, and that has been my position throughout the debate. I do not want it to be taken that, because we support amendments like this, somehow we are supporting that principle. If the Minister stands up and replies to this amendment by saying that if we have detention for those over 16 and it does not apply to those under 16, then the old bad ways of the police would apply to those under 16 and not over 16, I would have to say that our concern with the detention clauses is that a few policemen will abuse these detention powers as much as they abuse the present law. It will be a very few policemen who do it, and police-community relations will be very seriously upset if a few policemen abuse these detention powers as they have abused their powers in the past and there is nothing in the Bill which will stop them from doing so, though the next group of amendments which we are coming to may help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that if we find detention for those over 16 abhorrent,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
how much more abhorrent is it if it is applies to children under the age of 16. The reason why the whole detention clauses were brought in seem to be based on two arguments. The first is that it would regularise the position as it at present stands in Scotland, to which most of us object in the sense that we are saying that the police are breaking the law at present, and, therefore, let us give them the power to break it and make it legal to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason was that this was a way of ensuring that the police could take into short-term custody and question the hardened criminal, the man who knew the ropes, the man who had committed a lot of crimes in the past and knew what it was all about, and, therefore, the invitation would not apply to him because he knows his own position and rights, and says, "No way. I am not coming with you unless you actually arrest and charge me". It was to get that sort of person, who was committing a serious crime, into that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that there are children under the age of 16 who commit serious crimes, but nobody could possibly say they are hardened criminals—people who know their rights under the law, and are able to say when the policeman is inviting them, "We are not coming". Of course there may be a few. I can see the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) smiling at that. There may be a very few who are hardened criminals by the age of 16. If that is the case, it is a very serious indictment of our social system that it has ever arisen and it does arise. The fact is that for most children under the age of 16 it will not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember that if this power of detention is applied to children, even with the safeguards written into amendment No. 153 and future amendments, it applies to any offence for which there is imprisonment. If we go later on into the Bill, we find that the new crime of vandalism which the Government are introducing in the Bill carries imprisonment as punishment for that offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot of vandalism is done by children, and we do not yet know what act of vandalism might be. It might be that a constable sees a wall sprayed with paint, and around he sees children playing and thinks thay may be the ones involved. Under these detention clauses he can actually stop and pick them up, take them into the police station, and detain them for an act
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
of simple vandalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody likes the spraying of paint on walls, but one can hardly call it a serious crime. Yet under the Bill, if it goes through as it presently stands, with vandalism becoming part of it, it will be an offence punishable by imprisonment. Of course I am not saying that the child actually would be imprisoned for spraying paint on the wall, but the fact is that that offence could be punished by imprisonment, and therefore, a police constable would be entitled to detain a child for six hours if he thought he had reasonable grounds for suspecting he had been the child who sprayed the paint on the wall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, in this case, dealing just with people who have committed serious crimes. We are talking about a whole range of offences which carry imprisonment—often as last resort, but it is still there. As the clause is at present worded, it is for any offence for which imprisonment could given, at whatever stage. Therefore, as my hon. Friend says, young children of 8 or 9 could be detained under the clause. It may not happen very often, but it could happen, and there are not sufficient safeguards in the Bill in the whole of the detention clauses, and I should particularly like to see children under the age of 16 taken out of it completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to come to the point of the task which was introduced by my hon. Friend for Stirling and Grangemouth, the Shadow spokesman (Mr. Ewing), earlier. Before doing that, however, I want to put the record straight on one issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused me of raising somewhat spectacular, dramatic or lurid examples of police action. What I was doing, as was said by one of my colleagues, was not describing anything that the police might do beyond their legal powers—no abuse by the police. What I was describing was what is presently contained within the Government's proposals in the Bill which it would be quite legal for police to do, and that would be to detain, to search, to fingerprint a child of 9, to question a child of 9 on their own in a police station in most forbidding circumstances. That will be made quite legal, and the prospect of that to me is horrific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister describes my illustration as horrific or gruesome, that is only his description of my explanation of exactly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
what is in his Bill. If it is gruesome or horrific, it is what he is proposing that is gruesome or horrific, and I am only recounting it. What I thought was lurid and gruesome and horrific was his recitation of the statistics of 1977. I am not happy about these statistics, but what worries me is that the Government are suggesting that we should give more power only to the police. That is all they are suggesting with regard to these statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are more concerned with not punishing criminals. That is important, but that is not our main concern. Our main concern is preventing crime happening in the first place. It is much better to prevent crime than to punish people who commit criminal acts. With the increasing number of unemployed people, with public expenditure cuts which will diminish the leisure opportunities for young people, what the Government are doing will increase the likelihood of crime. As the Shadow spokesman said, I would not be surprised if the statistics are beginning to shoot up again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the more—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Serious?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That was very serious and very important. I come to the more conciliatory part of my speech. If it would be helpful, although it may be academic, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if I could get some assurances from the Minister, and I hope he will say just a few words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want blanket assurances. I was impressed by the intellectual rigour and the essential sense of the Ministers argument that it is better to regularise the position than to have an irregular position. I can see that, although I may have some doubts about the way he is going about it. Like my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I have very fundamental doubts. But all that the Minister has dealt with is one part, and that is the question of informing parents. There are three other parts. I was going to mention a whole constellation of them, but, from what my hon. Friend said, there are three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is if there is no parent available for one reason or another. Would it not be sensible also to have provision that a social worker or some other welfare worker should be informed? That point was raised
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
by my hon. Friend. In the case of people who are under the care of the local authourity, would it automatically be the case that someone from the local authority was informed? Is the local authority the guardian in that circumstance? It would help if there was an additional provision in the case where the parent was unavailable for one reason or another. I ask for that to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I want to make is with regard to the searching, the fingerprinting and the questioning of young people. As I said earlier, I am worried about this being carried out. Would it be possible for the Minister to consider that the searching, fingerprinting and questioning of a young person should take place once the parent has been informed and is present? Thirdly, and most important of all—this is really the crucial point on which I would like an assurance from the Minister, it is the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—is the right to access of the parent once he or she arrives. I know there are problems about the child's wishes and so on, but the parent should have the right of access to the child so that he can be present particularly during the questioning. The right should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that the ideal would be a right of access throughout the questioning, but could the Minister say there will be a right of access in terms of seeing the child when the parent arrives at the police station—not necessarily being there throughout the six-hour period, but at least the right to speak to the child and perhaps give him a little elementary advice and support would be an essential minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that would help. I was about to say, before my hon. Friend added that helpful point, that I would not expect the Minister to get up and say "The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) has made three points, which I immediately accept, which are of undoubted and irreproachable sense." But I hope that he might be able to say that, in the light of this debate—and it has been longer than I expected, I must confess, though perhaps that is not all my fault—he and his colleagues—because I know that he has to consult them on this matter—will give consideration particu-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
larly to these points with a view to the possibility of the Government tabling some amendments to deal with them on Report, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond to the point made by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and to similar points made by other hon. Gentlemen. The assurance that he sought related to the case where the parents of the child or suspect were either not known or could not be traced and whether some thought could be given to contacting someone else—a social worker or someone of that kind. I think that what the Government had in mind was that parents who were expecting the child to return home—who would obviously be concerned if the child did not return home should automatically be informed wherever possible. I am not certain what advantage there would be from anyone's point of view in an automatic notification to a social worker or someone of that kind if the parents were not known, but I shall look at that point to see whether it would be an improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is helpful. Can I say that it is only part of the reason why a parent should be informed. He should know where his child is, so that his anxiety, because of the absence of his child, can be alleviated. The other reason that has come out of this debate, which I did not adduce in my introductory remarks, was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden—so that he could offer advice, help and parental guidance to the child, which could be done by someone acting 	<i>in loco parentis.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; but in this case we are talking only about intimation, so as to reassure parents who wondered what had happened to their child. That would not be particularly advanced by notification to someone who was not directly expecting the child to be in a particular place at a particular time. But I shall certainly look at the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other suggestions by the hon. Gentleman related to whether parents should have access either to questioning or to any of the othe powers that can be exercised under clause 2. Here we are in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
a very real predicament. It may interest hon. Members opposite to know that I am informed that the children's panels chairmen's group was divided on this whole subject. There was a meeting of the children's panels chairmen's group with officials of my Department, at which about 30 people were present. A minority of those actually involved in the children's panels were hostile not only to parents having a right to be present, but to be informed of the fact of the child's detention. This was a minority, I stress, but the argument was put with some vehemence, I understand, that the child also has rights and that, unless the child requests the intimation to be made and other matters of that kind to happen, then the right should not be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->: 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can complete this particular point. The view of the Government with regard to intimation, as I indicated to be the hon. Member for Stirling, (Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is that there should be an absolute right of the kind we have indicated. Therefore, I do not see that it would be appropriate to have a right that parents be present during questioning or other matters of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) raised the wider issue not just of the right to be present during actual questioning or during the exercise of other powers, but whether it would be possible, once the parents came to the police station, for them to have some opportunity to see the child. I am happy to look at that proposal, because that raises a different issue from those we have been considering up to now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can continue in this helpful vein—because the Minister is being helpful—I understand that the executive of the Scottish Association of Children's Panels is to meet in the near future. I would also accept that total wisdom on this matter does not lie within Parliament. Most of it is outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister also indicate that he would consult the Association of Reporters and the Association of Directors of Social Work and anyone else he thinks is relevant on this issue before finally deciding? It might be helpful. We agree that there may be a division of opin-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
ion, and I think that they would welcome being consulted on this issue. It would be a very helpful lesson. It might help the Government. I would hesitate to suggest anything that would help the Government, but if it helps young people as well, I would suggest it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly look very closely at any points that any of these organisations wish to bring to our attention between now and Report. Obviously this matter is not closed. The whole point of the Report stage is to deal with any subsequent changes that are required. If representations are received from these organisations, we shall give them the fullest consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is being helpful. Will he accept that there is a strong feeling on this side that intimation in itself is not enough? The ideal that we would want is the right to be present at the pressure point, the questioning. But I accept that there may be arguments about that and that it may be very difficult for the police. But would the Under-Secretary consider his own feelings if he gets intimation from a policeman that his son has been detained in connection with an offence which is only described to him in general terms say, a child of 14 or 15? I think that the first thing that the parent would want to do is to go immediately to the police station, first, to find out what was happening and, second, to see his child and make sure that it was all right and to give, one would hope, a little understanding and support to the child, possibly even in terms of helping the police as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of police public relationships, to turn up in that situation with—an ill chosen phrase—one's appetite whetted by intimation and then to be told that one cannot even see one's child would be positively damaging to the relationship with the police. I hope that the Under-Secretary will look at this seriously before Report. I would take it as a very helpful gesture if he could make a move in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. One should emphasise that in the vast majority of cases at the moment the police, as a matter of normal practice, not only allow parents to have access to children but would actually wish the par-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
ents to be present during questioning or during anything of that kind. This is what happens in the vast majority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are unfortunately concerned with is the small minority of cases where it would not, or might not, be in the child's interest for the parents to be present because of the poor relationship between the child and the parents, because of the nature of the crime or alleged crime or offence which is involved. This is the matter which some members of the Children's Panel Chairman Group brought to the attention of the Department as to why they did not wish such a right to be provided for. Therefore, what we are talking about is not what will happen in the vast majority of cases but whether there should be a statutory obligation for it to happen in 100 per cent. of cases. That is what is of concern to us and was of concern to a minority of the very people whose views have been quoted today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Under-Secretary's problems and the difficulty of getting this drafted, in that we are dealing with a minority of cases. But would he not agree that if the situation was such that the child did not want the person present—not just the business of breaking down in tears and "Don't tell my daddy and mammy", but in the full sense when there is clearly a breakdown in the relationship—it would not be helpful to the child, the police or to the parents? In that case, it is a new situation. It is no longer a criminal situation but a social problem. Therefore, could it not be suggested here that, except in cases where it is clear, a social worker should be called in and then this process should take place in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as the police practice is concerned, I am not aware of any complaints over the years as to the way the police on a purely voluntary basis without any statutory obligation actually conduct inquiries involving children at the police station and questioning of that kind. If we had substantial evidence or even any evidence at all to suggest that this was a serious problem at the present time, that would be a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we do not want to delay this matter too long. I shall be happy to look at the point which the hon. Gentleman has raised, in particular the question of the normal situation that will arise when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>447</span>
the parents, having been informed, wish at least to have access to the child, not necessarily during the period of questioning or other matters of that kind, but simply, having arrived at the police station, they wish to make contact with the child. I cannot give any undertaking at this stage so far as any statutory amendments are concerned because I am genuinely concerned by that small minority of cases where the police at present do not think it appropriate that parents should be in the presence of the child for that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a small minority of cases, but the problem about statutory obligations is that they make no allowance for that small minority. They are, by definition, concerned with the total generality. But we shall certainly look at the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised. If it is thought appropriate to make any amendments, the Report stage will provide an opportunity to do so. But the specific amendments that the Government have introduced, requiring—I emphasise to the Shadow spokesman—statutory intimation to parents wherever possible, will be a major improvement which meets most of the representations that hon. Members have received in recent correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the assurances given by the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

and new clause 4—Complaints procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank you for making the decision to alter the selection so that the two principles involved in the first group can be discussed separately. I must thank you for that, following the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said today about bringing his amendment No. 138 forward first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is in some ways the most crucial amendment with which we have had to deal. The Opposition have largely detested the idea of the new power of detention. We are opposed to it fundamentally. I cannot speak for all my hon. Friends but certainly most of us here and the party in the House of Commons are opposed to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned because it is against a background not only of the proposal itself but of what is happening in society in general, and under this Government in particular. Giving new powers to the police is always dangerous. I am not suspicious of the individual policeman. On the contrary, I accept that the British police are the best and most competent in the world. I have had experience of the police in Italy, France and elsewhere and I accept that. But things can change, and we must be concerned with how they can change. Giving a new power is dangerous. It must be brought under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why I advocate this amendment to provide that we should not apply these new powers until an independent tribunal has been established—I draw the Committee's attention to new clause 4, is that it will be of assistance also to the police, certainly to the good police, which most of them are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have certain authority for this. I can again call in aid the Solicitor-General, on the last occasion when we discussed these matters, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>But where</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a police officer who is, so to speak, on one side of the battle, makes allegations about explanations which a person subsequently denies, that does nothing for the cause of justice."—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January, 1979; c.38.]</p></blockquote>
His concern was that under this procedure the number of complaints of this kind—denial by the police and denial by the suspect—would do nothing for the cause of justice. I happen, despite his cracks about my so-called liberal conscience, to be on the side of law and order in this matter. He said on exactly this point:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is this unfortunate and undesirable questioning of the credibility of the police with regard to written statements, we shall get it all the more under this procedure."—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30 January, 1979; c.147.]</p></blockquote>
If it is going to increase—I think that the Solicitor-General is right that it is—it will mean more tension, more argument and more problems in regard to public relations, and people must be satisfied that justice is done and is seen to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against this background that we say that—with this new power and the increase in disagreements between witnesses, suspects and the police that will take place, as the Solicitor-General himself underlines—security must be given by having an independent inquiry into complaints instead of only a police inquiry, and that, for the sake of the police themselves, this will be seen to have been judged through an independent inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now it is even more important because the clause, and the Bill, are not in isolation. It must be seen against a background of increasing surveillance, investigation and the expansion of the Special Branch—a problem that Conservative Members never understand. They have the security of their own background. They do not understand the situation that some of us who have come through the Labour movement will perhaps understand. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), who was in unfortunate error some years ago in assisting the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, is on the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will have taken him off now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They go as far as putting on the national police computer members of the anti-blood sports league, as has been shown recently. The hon. Member on that unfortunate occasion once gave evidence on behalf of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. When he has had our experience he will understand why we dislike increasing surveillance in society, and probably more, we know against which class, which groups and which ideas, it is generally waged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more dangerous, given that background of increasing surveillance and the increasing technology of computerising the information, and the rest, is the background of the Government. This happens
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
to be the most reactionary Government of this century. In their social measures they are probably the most reactionary Government since Sidmouth and Castlereagh. They are the only literally reactionary Government that I have ever encountered. Most Governments have been reactionary because they have failed to push progress forward, and they are reactionary because they are deliberately pushing it back, not only in economic affairs but in the whole question of freedom and civil liberties too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talk to a black kid down in Brixton, and he will reflect the new position that is coming through under the Government into police practice. Talk to immigrants coming in to Heathrow and to my airport at Glasgow, and they will tell you that a tougher line is emerging, knowing that it has the backing of a reactionary Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that Governments, even if by his own definition they may be reactionary, may also be very popular. Does he recollect a reference in a Chilean newspaper before the general election of 1973 in that country? It was a Communist newspaper, which reported the results of the election as "The people, 46 per cent, the reactionaries 54 per cent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that reaction can often be popular. People always believe that it is other people who are the baddies. In the same way that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) spends his time looking for scroungers on social security, he never sends the investigators out to Ascot to ask what they are doing on Derby afternoon. Of course it is popular. Everyone thinks that a scrounger is someone else, everyone thinks that a dissident is someone else. I remember that Pastor Bonhoeffer said this, in talking about the Nazis. He said, "First they came for the Jews. I was not a Jew so I did not act. Then they came for the Communists. I was not a Communist, so I did not act. Then they came for the trade unionists. I was not a trade unionist, so I did not act. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to act." We have to be aware of the extension of police powers in this society, and especially under this Government at the present time, and if this is not enough, one can see that the specific theorising and developing of a conscious atti-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>451</span>
tude to this is taking place. I call in aid the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Robert Mark. This is what he said about the police in his book 	<i>Policing in a Perplexed Society:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We discharge the communal will, not that of any government minister, mayor or other public official, or that of any political party, while remaining fully accountable to the community for what we do or fail to do."</p></blockquote>
This is what he sees as the role of the police, discharging the communal will, not that of a Government Minister, not that of a public official, a major, or any political party. The communal will is the will that will be decided by the police, says Sir Robert Mark, because he has rejected all the other expressions of the communal will. His view is rejected by other police, it is true, but it is a view that is gathering favour with very large sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notice what Sir Robert has down when he says that they are above politics—"We discharge the communal will". The surest sign of danger is when people tend to speak with arrogance and confidence that they speak for the community at large. In the past the tradition has been that police were above political affairs. This previously was the defence of the police to be inactive in political affairs. Sir Robert has turned this on its head. He is turning the business of the police being above politics and apart from politics on its head, and then it becomes in itself a justification for action, a justification for intervention, because he says that the police should not be political but they represent the communal will as opposed to the communal will as decided through political voting or democracy or responsible officials; the action, therefore, comes from them. That is the danger of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He goes further in his book, 	<i>The Office of Constable:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The police are…very much on their own in attempting to preserve order in an increasingly turbulent society in which Socialist philosphy has changed from raising the standard of the poor and deprived to reducing the standards of the wealthy, the skilled and the deserving to the lowest denominator."</p></blockquote>
So, we now see how the communal will is to be expressed. The communal will is to be expressed against these unfortunate Socialists who have stopped thinking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
about increasing the standards of the poor and are looking at reducing the standards of the wealthy, the skilled and the deserving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a dangerous line of thinking, and the Government had better recognise that it is a dangerous line of thinking, because it is a popular line of thinking; it is a line of thinking developed by the present chief constable of Manchester, for example. May I find the same kind of thing being said by the present Commissioner, not with regard to the same theoretical position; but we will deal with that in a moment. I am stressing this because I believe we are facing a danger, and the danger in clause 2 is the beginning of bringing this kind of danger into our police procedures. Sir Robert Mark goes further when he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The post-war years have seen a gradual change in our role from mere law enforcement."</p></blockquote>
"mere"—note the word "mere", "from mere law enforcement", changing their role. I thought this was their role, and I see nothing "mere". I think it valuable and socially important. Sir Robert says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to participants in the role of contributors in the moulding of public opinion and legislation."</p></blockquote>
So, he sees this kind of active role, and he sees an expression of it through proposals which have been put forward in the Royal Commission on England and Wales. We are seeing certain examples coming through the Thomson report and expressed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Sir Robert Mark makes an even more dramatic statement. He specifically puts his finger on what he sees as the danger:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not only do the unions enjoy a high degree of immunity from the law; in any critical situation in which the law does not support them the Government of the day—their partner or their puppet according to your view—"</p></blockquote>
This is his view of politics and of Ministers.

Like most other people, if I believed that this was the danger in front of us would adopt alnost any method in order to prevent it. It is against this background that we seek to introduce an independent police tribunal so that at the starting point care and attention should be given to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other aspects here, and it is very worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these powers are to be given in this way, if complaints are not to have the security of an independent tribunal, we know how in general they will be applied. For example, the Scottish Chief Constable, now the Commissioner in London, described an anti-National Front march in Haringey in April 1977—an anti-National Front, anti-Nazi march—as a counterdemonstration organised by the Socialist Workers Party, the International Marxist Group, the Communist Party of England and others. What is notable there is his reference to "others", because the others included the Labour Party and the Labour Mayor of Haringey. Many Labour councillors and Labour supporters were prominent in this demonstration, even anti-racist Conservative councillors. So we know that these powers will eventually be used. They will be used against the working people in this country; they will be used against the working-class organisations in the country; they will be used against working-class children who are picked up by the police. This is a point, which it is difficult to get through to hon. Members opposite, who have never experienced this, who have no fear of running risks of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background of police theorising under this Government, who accept this point of view. For example, the Commissioner by his criticisms of the right hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior), because he capitulates to the unions, shows the contempt in which police theorising holds all politicians—and that applies to all hon. Members of the Committee. This is the background against which we are now introducing an arguably defendable set of police procedural matters. No one is suggesting that this Bill gives expression to some of the ideas put forward by Sir Robert Mark. Nevertheless—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been speaking for nearly 15 minutes. He has made a very wide-ranging speech giving the background, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>454</span>
I think it is about time that he came to the specific amendment before the Committee. While hon. Members are allowed to make references and analogies in the debate, this is not a Second Reading of the Bill but a debate on the clause and the amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the ruling of the Chair, and note the point about references and analogies. Indeed, I thought that this kind of thing proved the importance of having a public element in police tribunals dealing with complaints. This is now the concept that is developing among the police, that they will obey the communal will rather than that of the democratic bodies, which are treated as politicians. It is precisely because of this that we require the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the proposals in the Bill. The reason we require this amendment is that the process of detention begins without the safeguards and legal redress that come with the formal process of charging and arrest. It puts people into a questioning and interrogation situation, which we have been fighting and resisting, without that kind of safeguard and security. People will complain. If they do not complain they are sheep, and I do not believe people are sheep. People will complain, and I am saying that the only security that we shall have in our consciousness, and, furthermore, the only safeguard that will be given to good police and the only prevention that we shall have against bad police, is the presence of a public representation on the complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is being fought against by Sir Robert Mark and David McNee. Why are they fighting against it. They say that it reduces the authority of the chief constable normally these inquiries are put in the hands of another police force, or the deputy chief constable of another police force that it reduces the authority of the police and that it should be left. I say that it cannot be left here any longer. If the argument has been that the police in the past have gone beyond their remits—as was also referred to by David McNee—the answer that the Thomson committee has come up with, and that this Committee has come up with on the question of detention, is that we will then regularise this. The police have been committing illegalities, so we shall therefore regularise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to bring in this process of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
regularising, it must have some safeguards. We have sought and lost safeguards on the question of the limitation of questioning before it is under proper judicial procedure. There is only one thing left. If it is right to believe that it will not be abused, it does not matter that there should be a public element on the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General was right a year ago when he said that it would lead to more complaints, more aggrievance, it is equally right that a member of the person should be on it. So on both counts the necessity is made for a public presence on the tribunals into police complaints. I think it is necessary, I think it is right, and surely it will have the backing of the Solicitor-General, as I think that he recognises the points I am making. He has argued the case in the past. It does not reduce police authority. On the contrary, it increases police authority in the only way that is right—by creating greater confidence between the community and the police and an assurance that the good will be exonerated and the bad will be punished, dispelling the fear that people will have that process such as detention without legal redress can also be subsumed and that bad police behaviour will not get proper public redress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This time I shall not say that I did not intend to speak, because I had every intention of speaking in this debate. But it is with some reticence that I follow the brilliant speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) laying down the background to the reasons why we feel this series of amendments is essential to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major reason given both by the Labour Government when they introduced a similar Bill containing detention as a new power for the police and by this Government is to regularise the existing position and to give the police greater ability to deal with crime. Why did they suggest that we should regularise the position? I should think it was because that on occasions the police were going beyond their existing powers under the law and that there was a need to bring it under some form of control and to give some sort of legal standing to what the police are at present doing. Whether it is illegal or just a breach of police procedure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
does not matter. The fact is that they are doing something at the present time that they are not supposed to do. That has been the major argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, the problem is not solved by these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the detention clauses give a more regular feature to actual detention but they do not deal with the problem of the police who abuse this power. At that stage, and I repeat it, the whole process of detention as laid down in this Bill is left entirely in the hands of the police. It is the policeman who says when the detention starts. It is the policeman who takes the person to the police station. It is the policeman who lays down the rights of the individual and what he should say. I shall wait until I have the Minister's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for listening to what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us, particularly those who are trained in courts, are perfectly capable of listening with one ear whilst talking to someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why the hon. and learned Gentleman loses so many cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that they may have great success in doing it. I find it rather difficult, and I certainly find it rather difficult to speak when there is a rather loud voice, which I think the Solicitor-General will agree that he has, murmuring away in the background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General's remarks must have been more audible to the hon. Gentleman than to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, Mr. Gourlay. The point I was making was that at all stages through the detention clauses it is the police who are in control. It is the police who decide whether or not someone shall be informed that a person has been detained, whether it be a solicitor or a friend. Only today we discover that the Government are prepared to concede that there is an absolute right that parents shall be informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, the police are in charge. I believe that 98 per cent. of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
police will carry out these new detention powers strictly within the letter of the law. But no Conservative Member will deny that there are policemen—unfortunately sometimes at a very high level—who do not have respect for law and order. The chief constable of Manchester is one of them. He wishes to go beyond law and order as stated by Parliament in terms of the power of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A small percentage of the police will abuse this power. It requires only two or three policemen in one police station of 30 or 40 policemen to start destroying police-community relations. At present, if there is a complaint about the way in which a policeman is using the new detention power, the police will deal with that complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us here are professional people and we all know, whatever our profession—teaching, the law, medicine or quantity surveying—that professional people and workers of any sort tend to band together to protect themselves. That is legitimate for any group of workers to do. It is legitimate to try to defend one's own workers. It is a legitimate trade union activity. The Conservatives often complain when trade unionists try to do that—through the closed shop, through strikes about dismissals or abuse of contracts and so on. That is legitimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police, when complaints are made, on too many occasions close ranks. It is difficult for the public to discover what is happening in a disciplinary case. They are not necessarily told what is going on. There have been examples recently in England and Wales of police refusing to issue reports of internal inquiries into indiscipline to inquest juries and to coroners. As a result there is an increasing cynicism about the way in which the police deal with their own complaints, even if in most cases the police deal fairly with them and try to do something about it. Only three or four public cases are needed for it to appear to the public mind that there is some kind of cover-up by the police, that the true facts are not being given to the public and that the people, if they are guilty, are not being punished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify one thing. Will the hon. Member accept that in a substantial number of cases allegations have been made against the police which are completely unfounded and malicious?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. It is the strongest argument for our amendments. If large numbers of allegations are malicious and unfounded, yet they are always investigated only by the police, the people who make the allegations can always claim: "We were correct, but it was a cover-up job." Who is to deny them the right to say that? There is no independent body, nobody outside the police, looking into the allegations and proving them to be absolute nonsense and a mischievous attempt to do the police down. If there is an independent element these allegations can be dealt with more effectively and more clearly in terms of satisfying public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worrying. We are, as my hon. Friend said, on the side of law and order. It is the way in which we tackle these problems. It is our view that for the police to operate, they must have community help. It has been widely proved through research that about 80 per cent. of all cases solved by the police require community help to secure that result. We are concerned that the new clauses of themselves will destroy that relationship, make it more difficult for the police to solve crime, and therefore make law and order worse, not better. If the public increasingly feel that because there is no way in which their complaints about the police—or any complaint about the police—are dealt with by anybody but the police, then cynicism creeps in. People become increasingly wary of the police. There is an increasing cynicism. Again, I am trying to speak, Mr. Gourlay, over the Solicitor-General's voice. I know he is listening with great attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am. But the fact is that there will be increasing cynicism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Increasing cynicism, again, means poorer police and poorer public relations. Poorer police and poorer public relations mean poorer law and order. It is as simple as that. The way to solve the problems of law and order are twofold. We must ensure that the police have a decent relationship with the community at large, and that the public at large trust the police and want to work with them. The other way, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said earlier, is to try to solve genuinely some of the social prob-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>459</span>
lems which cause crime, and not just to continue to batter way at people when they commit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the police appear to many of the public at large to be above the law by being the only people who have their complaints dealt with by the police. The detention clauses have been written into the Bill but where in the Bill does it state the penalties on a police constable if he breaks this law? I shall be grateful if the Solicitor-General will intervene now to tell me the penalty, who will investigate, who will make sure that it goes to trial with the procurator fiscal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. The Solicitor-General says that he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The communal will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But what will be the offence that the constable will have commited? What will be the offence with which a constable can actually be charged and then dealt with by the courts? What penalties will be imposed? A witness who does not give his address can be fined up to £50 for a first offence. If one is going to be detained it can be £200. A constable may use legitimate force to detain one, and if one still fights against it one can be charged with other offences. But there is nothing in the Bill that says what will happen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A police officer who detains a person against his will in a police station without the force of law is in the same position as any other member of the public who detains someone forcibly against his will. That is a common law offence, and the hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that there is no limit on the sentence that a court could pass, depending on the circumstances that are thought appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister for that. It emphasises again the importance of an independent element. Again, if the punishment has no limit, there is an even greater case for saying that if the constable detains the person for seven hours rather than six, that is an hour's kidnapping, or holding a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
person against his will, or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the police are not likely to want to push the person into a court of law on that matter to try to have it resolved. I am not saying that an independent inquiry would want to push it that far, but at least an independent inquiry would give the person being detained some sense of security, some feeling that behind the police there was somebody who would look into his case and deal with it for him on sound grounds of justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is important to understand that, as the hon. Gentleman puts it, behind the police there is somebody. We have a procurator fiscal service, and behind that the advocate deputies, and behind them the law officers. That is how the matter is investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to say that that frightens me even more, but up to a point it does. It is also up to a point inaccurate, because presumably if there is a complaint against the police by a member of the public it is to the police. Now the procurator fiscal will only find out if it goes further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have inquired into these matters before he made these claims. If the police receive a complaint which suggests that if the complaint is justified the law has been broken, it must be referred to the procurator fiscal. If, on the other hand, the complaint, even if justified, only amounts to a breach of police discipline or police rules, only then is it dealt with by the police themselves. Anything that suggests that criminal law or any other law has been broken has to go to the procurator fiscal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the important phrase there is "if the complaint is justified". Who decides whether it is justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The police do not consider whether it is justified. If they receive a complaint, the police have to decide, if the complaint is a justifiable claim, whether it amounts to a breach of the law. If it does, the procurator fiscal has to look into it. The police do not say that they do not believe the complaint is justified and that, therefore, they will not bother send-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
ing it to the fiscal. It is the fiscal that must come to that judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I apologise for misunderstanding the Minister's words, but that is how it sounded to me. I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Sterling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), when he comes to speak in the debate, will be able to say a lot more about the matter, because he has been dealing with this sort of problem for many years, for longer than the Minister himself. But the fact is that there still is not an independent inquiry system outside the legal system as a whole, and there has to be one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a people's court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite may laugh, but the fact remains that there is a growing cynicism in a large section of the public. It is not necessarily the criminal classes who feel this but active trade unionists, who, I agree hon. Members opposite might like to think were in the criminal classes. It is among active Labour
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
movement politicians who feel that on occasion there is police abuse, whether it be on picket lines or at demonstrations, and that there is an inadequate procedure for dealing with those complaints. Here we have the police powers being increased, and these powers can be used against the person on the picket line or on the demonstration in a variety of different ways. Police powers are being increased, and these people feel even more wary about how these powers will be used, and abused, by the police. We on the Opposition side feel that there ought to be a way in which the public can be assured that their complaints are being adequately dealt with. Therefore, I should like to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
