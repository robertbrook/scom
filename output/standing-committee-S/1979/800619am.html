<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the Committee proceedings on Tuesday morning, I ruled correctly that, while reference to the Dunpark committee report was in order, it was not in order to discuss the merits of the report's recommendations. On that basis, I accordingly intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). Having now read his speech in the <i>Official Report,</i> it appears that I placed a wrong construction on his remarks, and I apologise for my intervention on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for that handsome and gracious apology which, of course, I accept. I am sure that we shall manage the remaining proceedings in harmony.</span></p>

Clause 66</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DESIGNATION OF SPORTS GROUNDS AND SPORTING EVENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 322, in page 46, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"or a class of sports ground".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 323, in page 46, line 30, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"or a class of sporting event".</p></blockquote>
No. 324, in page 46, line 31, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"or at any of that class of ground".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great pleasure in speaking to the amendment, and I intend to do so by first asking a few short questions. On the basis of the Minister's reply, we shall be able to decide whether it is necessary to have a debate of any length or substance.<br><br>
Clause 66 is the trigger clause, the basic clause, in part V of the Bill. It gives the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1366</span>
Government a splendid opportunity, which I am sure they will wish to take, to say a little about their policy as to the designation of sports grounds and the categories of grounds likely to fall within part V.<br><br>
Amendment No. 322 is really a mechanism for inviting the Minister to explain what is meant by
<br><blockquote><p>"or a class of sports ground."</p></blockquote>
On the face of it, I assume that he is considering a blanket designation which would cover categories, for example, such as all premier league football grounds or all second division football grounds. But it might be useful if he could say how, and when, he envisages such a designation being used.<br><br>
Amendment No. 323 seeks to omit the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or a class of sporting event."</p></blockquote>
I am curious to know exactly what the Minister has in mind. I can see that there is a prima facie case from the Minister's point of view for having the most comprehensive wording in clause 66, so that he has the maximum flexibility. But at this late stage, after all the consideration and internal discussion, the Minister must have a fairly clear idea, strategically, how it will operate. A few glimpses into his mind would help the Committee.<br><br>
Amendment No. 324 looks at the proviso which excludes, as I understand it, all sporting events at which those taking part do not pay and from which there is no financial or material reward. That is a category of events which might be supposed to constitute as big a threat as the average second division football match. There are occasions on which admission is free to a charitable event, but it is a fund-raising event once one is at it. Anyone who had been in the business of raising funds for voluntary organisations knows that on occasion it may be tactically sound to say "You can enter the place for nothing, but once you are in there are subsections within the venue for which you have to pay, either to watch or to participate."<br><br>
Suppose there were a very large crowd at a sporting display in a stadium—say, Scotstoun showground in Glasgow—and that, as a matter of tactics, the organisers charged no entry fee and no one was financially benefiting from it but that those who went were to be invited to pay in order to participate under the guidance in certain sporting activities or to watch
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0801">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1367</span>
experts performing. Suppose that a large number of people turned up on a nice summer day with a great deal of alcohol in their possession. I am not sure that it would be right that that event should be excluded from designation if the authorities thought that it might create a hazard. The Opposition feel that the proviso may be a little broad in its terms, and therefore definition or explanation from the Minister would be welcome.<br><br>
This is an opportunity for the Under-Secretary of State to explain the Government's attitudes and policies, and how he sees designation developing. He will no doubt say whether football will be—in the early days at least—an exclusive target. The Committee will remember that there has been some debate about happenings at other grounds—Murrayfield, for example. Although I think that that has been clarified —in the sense that there has been a retreat from what was said in another place—it might be satisfying if it were spelt out for our benefit that there will be no question, as was at one time suggested, that those events seen to have a little more social tone should in some way be excluded entirely from the operation of part V of the Act.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us the Government's intentions?</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for the probing nature of the amendment, as it gives me an opportunity to indicate the Government's thinking on this important subject.<br><br>
As the Committee will be aware, these proposals stem largely—although not entirely—from the recommendations of the working group chaired by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone). I should like to emphasise that the proposals are not exactly the same. Certain details of proposals may be different from those recommended by the hon. Gentleman's group, and certain of his proposals have not been accepted by the Government. But I pay tribute to him and to his colleagues for their work in this important area. It is clearly a problem which has not disappeared. It has, if anything, become more acute and more in the public eye since the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues reported.<br><br>
The Government thought that as this Bill was before Parliament it was a good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1368</span>
opportunity to make a proper, fulsome and considered response to what has become an embarrassing but nevertheless important problem in Scotland. I know that hon. Members of all parties are anxious to deal with it.<br><br>
To a substantial, extent the problems which are concerning us—of drunkenness and of drink-related incidents at football grounds—are not matters which can simply be dealt with by legislation. I do not suggest for one moment that the passing of these provisions will by itself solve the problem, or lead to trouble-free football in Scotland.<br><br>
Nevertheless, anyone who has taken any interest in these matters cannot escape the fact that much of the violence and many of the disturbances at Scottish football matches are related to the consumption of alcohol, either because the individuals are under the influence of drink and are behaving in a drunken and loutish fashion, or because alternatively—or in addition— they are using cans, bottles, and other objects connected with alcohol as missiles when various types of trouble break out.<br><br>
We know that a high proportion of those arrested at football matches in Scotland have consumed alcohol and are in various stages of inebriation. One of the saddest aspects of this problem is the high proportion of young people found in this condition who are involved in trouble of this kind.<br><br>
Clearly it is an important matter to take legislative power to prohibit an activity which in other respects is legal. I do not wish to minimise the importance of seeking to prohibit by legislation the consumption of alcohol in a public place at a time when, in normal circumstances, that would be considered an appropriate social form of activity.<br><br>
With that problem in mind, it is essential to ensure that the ambit of these provisions is limited to those sports, and to the places where those sports are played, where the problem has existed at a difficult or acute level. Therefore the principle of designation has been adopted by the Government to ensure that there is no blanket prohibition on the consumption of alcohol at sporting events in Scotland, because that would be taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut. The prohibition would be gravely resented in many sports, including football, where alcohol has not been a serious problem and where such measures would not be appropriate. That is the background to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0802">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1369</span>
concept of designation which the Government have adopted.<br><br>
I also emphasise that the fact that a ground or sporting event has been designated by the Secretary of State does not necessarily mean that that will be a permanent state of affairs. It will be designated by order but, if the problem is then resolved in a particular place, it will not require new legislation for that location or event to be relieved from that burden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not the report with me but I remember that the Minister's reply in the other place to points made in relation to this matter made clear that it would be a permanent designation and not for each event <i>seriatim.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to mislead the hon. Gentleman. He is quite correct. I am not suggesting that there will be a designation for each event as it is being approached. There will be an order designating certain grounds and certain classes of event when it is required and that order will take effect permanently. But it is always possible, by a subsequent order, to de-designate a particular location or a class of event if circumstances show that it is no longer required for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister,
however, say whether the reverse is true— that it can be a temporary order? If, for instance, there were an order at Murray-field, which has not been a designated ground, for one specific event only, and the Secretary of State or the police in the Lothian region felt that it would create problems in that respect, could they designate it for that one event?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the terms of clause 66 provide that that could be done. However, I add the proviso that, because the order designating a ground is subject to parliamentary procedure, it could not be done overnight. It could not be done a couple of days before the event. There is a parliamentary procedure that would have to be fulfilled but, subject to that, there is no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may feel there is a technical point here. Subsection (2) states that the order shall be exercised by a statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a negative resolution of either House. I am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1370</span>
not an expert in timetables, but that suggests that there would be a considerable time lapse before the event. Therefore, if a one-off event at a sports ground could clearly be seen as a major threat, a considerable period of notice would have to be given to the Minister by the organisers of their intention to hold a sporting event. Have any arrangements been made about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. It would take about a month for the normal parliamentary procedure to be completed. One could assume that a substantial proportion of such events would come within the grounds and events already designated. It will be a relatively rare occasion that a sporting event of such importance, where the consumption of alcohol is likely to lead to serious trouble, does not already fit in with one of the categories designated. The Government feel that it is right that, if a prohibition applies, it is highly desirable that the public are given good forewarning of the prohibition. It would be inappropriate if individuals, who were perfectly entitled to believe that the consumption of alcohol was permitted, were suddenly to find, two days beforehand, an order slapped down, which the vast majority of them might not know about, to which they could not be reasonably expected to be able to respond. Therefore, it seems that the appropriate way is to deal with general designations. But there is the specific power, if a particular circumstance merited it, to deal with the kind of specific designation to which the hon. Member for Cathcart referred.<br><br>
It may be helpful if I indicate the kind of designations that the Government are considering. Clause 66 proposes:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may for the purposes of this Part of this Act by order designate—
<ol>
<li>a sports ground or a class of sports ground;</li>
<li>a sporting event, or a class of sporting event".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Those are not alternatives. They are additional requirements and unless a particular matter satisfies both requirements the prohibition would not apply. In other words, there may be a designated ground but if the event being played at that ground were not designated there would be no prohibition. Equally, the reverse could apply.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0803">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1371</span>
Therefore, for the prohibition to apply, both circumstances have to be fulfilled. The event being played at the ground has to be either an event or one of a class of events which had been designated, and the ground at which it was being played has to be either a ground or a class of ground which had been designated by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly clear. What happens if a sports ground is designated but, in fact, it is not a sporting event taking place but, for example, a rock concert or a massive protest demonstration against the Government's policies? Is this not caught by the provisions of the Bill? It is not a sporting event, despite the fact that the sports ground is itself designated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy that the hon. Gentleman has put that question, although I am not sure that his examples were felicitous. At such a demonstration it is unlikely that there would be any trouble.<br><br>
The prohibition would not apply because, although the ground would be a designated ground, the class of event would be unlikely to come within a sporting event or class of sporting event that had been designated by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me give a recent practical example. If, for instance, it was in the Minister's mind that Ibrox stadium should be designated for football matches, a world title boxing event held there would not, in fact, be caught under section 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly correct, unless there had been some general designation of boxing matches. In the absence of any such specific order-relating to boxing matches, it would not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does say in (<i>a</i>) "a sports ground" and does not say "and the". It does not refer to a sports ground at which a sporting event takes place. It could be a sporting event <i>per se.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is essentially a drafting matter but if it had been meant to be an alternative it would have said "or" Anyway, the hon. Member will see that {<i>b</i>) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a sporting event, or a class of sporting event, at that ground or at any of that class of ground".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1372</span>
In other words, (<i>b</i>) and (<i>a</i>) are linked together. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the intention and the drafting would have the result intended by the Government, and that both factors have to be satisfied before the prohibition is satisfied. We shall look at that drafting point, but that is its intention and it has that present effect.<br><br>
Consultations will be held with the police and the football or other sporting authorities before any decision on designation is reached. A designation order will, of course, be subject to a negative resolution of the House. However, with the aim of combating the violence associated with sporting events, and football in particular, the candidates being considered —I emphasise these are candidates being considered at the present time—are the following.<br><br>
The grounds being considered for designation are, first, all the grounds in Scotland regularly used by clubs which are members of the three divisions of the Scottish Football League; second, Hampden Park; and, third, Murrayfield.<br><br>
Events as well as classes of ground have to be met. First, all matches in Scotland in the premier, first and second divisions of the Scottish Football League. Secondly, all matches in the competitions for the SFA and SFL cups; for the European, UEFA and Cup-Winners' Cups; and for Rugby Union internationals.<br><br>
Those are the specific classes of grounds, the events and specific events that are being considered for designation. But I emphasise that before any final decision is taken there will be discussions with the police and with the sporting authorities. In the light of those discussions, an order will be put before Parliament on the basis of the procedure outlined in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister why it is necessary to make Hampden a separate category? Is it not covered anyway, as a football ground of one of the teams in the third division, or do they know something about Queen's Park that I do not know?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert in these matters, but if it was in the third division t would not be relevant. The problem is that when the third division is not included there is no way of guaranteeing that a club which may at one stage be in one division does not in a subsequent year move to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0804">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1373</span>
another, if I may put it as delicately as that. Therefore, it would be inappropriate if, in the case of a ground such as Hampden Park, its designation were altered for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I obviously did not make my point properly. I meant to say "in one of the three divisions, even though it may be the bottom of the three". Queen's Park is in the second division, as it is now—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is really the third division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—which is really the third division, as my hon. Friend says.<br><br>
I think that the Government placed Hampden Park in a separate category because they were expecting, until this week, that it would be turned over to a new company. That is why they did not designate it in the Queen's Park category.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is indulging in delightful speculation which has no substance. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the discussions on specific designation took place some time ago. I mentioned Hampden Park simply for purposes of illustration. This is a club which is not in the premier league, although its ground is used for major sporting events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary explain the position of Berwick, which for the purposes of football is in Scotland but for all other purposes is in England? Some of us believe that Berwick might more appropriately be in Scotland. Is the Under-Secretary saying that on this occasion we shall be legislating for Berwick? That would be a good innovation and one that I would welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I anticipated that an hon. Gentleman might raise the peculiar problem of Berwick Rangers, who are involved in the Scottish football scene, although Berwick is not at present within the Scottish territorial boundaries. The position is that these provisions apply only to Scotland, and it would be inappropriate for any legislation of this kind to have legal effect south of the border.<br><br>
If, therefore, Berwick Rangers are playing in Scotland, the provisions will apply not only to the grounds on which they are playing but to any supporters
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1374</span>
travelling within Scotland by coach or by any of the other means covered by the legislation. But any match in Berwick itself could not be covered, because the legislation does not extend to England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the obvious question about the clauses in part V of the Bill which refer to supporters' buses? If Glasgow Rangers are drawn against Berwick Rangers in the Scottish Cup at Berwick and if by chance—it is almost inconceivable and I am sure that historic inevitability means that it cannot happen— Berwick Rangers beat Glasgow Rangers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my colleagues will not bother me with fact in this matter.<br><br>
I trust that this would not arise, but if discontented Glasgow Rangers supporters were returning home from what would normally be a designated ground but presumably is not designated, would their supporters' buses be covered by part V of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position would be identical to that of an international. If an international between Scotland and England were being played in Glasgow, any supporters coming from the South would, on crossing the border, be affected by Scottish legislation. Equally, when they return across the border, they cease to be affected by Scottish legislation. To this extent, it is no different from any other legislation. The provisions apply only within Scotland. Therefore, they apply only to those travelling to or from a designated ground and event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Berwick is not designated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The position in Berwick is exactly the same as for an international between Scotland and England. One accepts that Berwick is an anomaly, but there is no way in which the legislation could be extended to cover what was happening south of the border without this Scottish Bill taking effect in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, because it has more general implications than perhaps the peculiarity of Berwick. Let us say that Scotland is playing England at Wembley. Wembley is not and cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0805">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1375</span>
be a designated sports ground. Is the Minister saying that the rules about the conduct of coaches of supporters will apply when a coach returning from Wembley crosses the border because it is not going to or from a designated sports ground? Wembley is not a designated ground. Similarly, the Rangers' support-ters' buses going to and from Shielfield could not be caught by the provisions of part V because Shielfield is not a designated sports ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can clarify the point in this way. Scottish supporters, either going to Wembley or returning from Wembley, would not be affected by these proposals because, as the hon. Gentleman correctly pointed out, Wembley cannot be a designated sports ground. But English supporters travelling to Hampden or travelling home from Hampden would be covered by these provisions in Scotland because Hampden will be a designated ground and the nature of the sporting event taking place there would be a designated sporting event. Therefore, the provisions apply in Scotland but only when the event and the ground, either to which supporters are travelling or from which they have travelled, is a designated ground and event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised an important point. In the past, the main problem has arisen when Scottish supporters travel south of the border to international matches at Wembley. Those matches would not be covered by these provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. Clearly, it would be for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to consider whether he wished to take legislative powers regarding matches played at Wembley. I do not think that it would be appropriate for a Scottish Bill to designate what can or cannot be done at Wembley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or the way in which it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be far too difficult to try to frame legislation in that way. It is much more sensible to limit the legislation to designated grounds and events taking place in Scotland, although it will certainly cover supporters in Scotland who may have started their journey outside Scotland on the day of the event.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1376</span>
Therefore, this is the basis of the designation contemplated by the Secretary of State now. It will be subject to full consultation, not only with the police but especially with the sporting authorities.<br><br>
I hope that those points meet the natural queries which led the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to table these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to delay the Committee now because we are anxious to discuss the detail on clause stand part. However, the Minister has displayed the difficulties in which we find ourselves on the whole matter. Clearly, the redeeming feature—I direct this comment to my hon. Friends—is that we shall have a second bite at this cherry when the statutory instrument designating the sports grounds is laid by the Government and also at any time they wish to designate a particular sporting event. Of course, we shall return to that when the statutory instrument is laid. As the Minister has said, under the provision of the clause there can be no question of grounds or events being designated unless a statutory instrument is laid before the House. It is obvious that not only shall we get one more bite at this cherry, but that we shall get numerous bites when the statutory instruments are laid.<br><br>
However, the Minister was making heavy weather of the matter because, when the safety in sportsgrounds legislation was introduced a simple approach was adopted, namely, that only the grounds of league clubs in Scotland—and Hampden and Murrayfield—would be designated. The question of designating the grounds of first and second division clubs did not arise. I know that there is a problem. When a club is promoted from the first division to the premier league its ground is designated under the safety in sportsgrounds legislation and the designation is not removed if the club is relegated.<br><br>
No doubt that will come out in the Minister's discussions with the football authorities and the police. But I am worried about the effect that the provision will have on second division clubs in particular, and on one or two first division clubs, too, because I know of a number of second division clubs—including East Fife in your own constituency, Mr. Gourlay— which have a social club inside the perimeter of the ground. East Stirling, a team in my own constituency—which I am delighted to say has just been promoted to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0806">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1377</span>
first division—has a social club within yards of the main entrance to the ground. In my home town, Cowdenbeath, over which I watch fondly, has a social club just outside the main entrance to the ground.<br><br>
In those circumstances, the discussion that the Minister will have with the football authorities will produce problems with which he will no doubt deal. From our point of view, the salient point this morning is that we shall come back to this matter because of the obligation the Government have assumed to carry out this measure by statutory instrument. We shall have various bites at this cherry as the statutory instruments are made. On that basis, I advise my hon. Friend's not to press the amendments. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sounded like a hint. We shall, clearly, watch the development very closely. We shall probably all have a chance to speak later on clause stand part. I do not entirely accept the argument that we want to limit this to a tight category of grounds. These are important powers in terms of infringement of the normal activities of the individual. There is an argument for saying that if it is made too localised, people outside the defined area may be left with a legal advantage. "Come to Cowdenbeath and drink" may well be the slogan, as my hon. friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) suggests.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give a better example than Cowdenbeath. Dunfermline Athletic football club has a social club in the main stand. I understand that Raith Rovers—again in your constituency, Mr. Gourlay—has a very plush social club of which I believe you are one of the best-known members. Kircaldy is a wealthy place built up over the years by the linoleum barons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This matter comes up under amendment No. 336 in any event. No doubt the Minister will be able to say a word or two at that stage about social clubs within the grounds. However, at this point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1378</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That clause 66 stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), who presided over the committee that produced the report that was eventually to inspire some innocent civil sevant to produce 10 clauses which were found within the pages of that report.<br><br>
I should like, if I may without straying beyond the bounds of order, to say something about all 10 clauses—the whole of part V of the Bill. I congratulate the civil servant concerned. This part looks as though it has been written by a civil servant for whom his superiors were seeking a task. I remember one such civil servant in the Scottish Office for whom there was not much to do. We found him a job. It looks as though this was the job found for him. I am tempted to re-name part V of the Bill "Scott's Corner" because I understand that it was a young man named Scott who drafted it. I pay tribute to him; he has done a first-class job.<br><br>
Nevertheless, these are very important matters, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) says. The paving clause, clause 66, is really the main clause of part V of the Bill, and I am sure that my hon. Friends will wish to make their comments on that. I have already posed some difficulties to which we shall come later when we discuss further amendments about grounds that already have social clubs in them.<br><br>
The example always given is that of football matches. However, the serious problem of violence is spilling over into other sporting events. I am convinced that the reason why fewer people now go to football matches has nothing to do with the quality of the play. It has everything to do with the fear that one cannot stand in safety at a sports ground without possibly having one's head split open, or something like that.<br><br>
Also, the Government and the Opposition have an obligation—and we accept our obligation—not only to look at the causes but to try to find cures. I remember that when we were reforming the Licensing Act and we were talking to various people about the effects of drink on youngsters, I had the devil's own job convincing the head of one of the biggest chain stores in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0807">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1379</span>
Scotland that it was his cheap wine that triggered these youngsters off. It was not whisky or beer but the cheap wine that is available at shops that are open from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. Youngsters can buy any amount of cheap hooch, which is what triggers them off.<br><br>
There was once an exercise done at Easter Road after Rangers and Hibs had played, when it was suggested that, instead of clearing the terraces of bottles and cans, it should be left until the following day so that researchers could go in to see exactly what sort of alcoholic containers were left there. I was not surprised at the result, which showed that about 70 per cent. of the containers had had cheap wine in them. We should look, first, at what is causing the problem and then suggest some cures.<br><br>
I say at once that I am not a total prohibitionist on the question of the ability to have a drink at a sporting event. It would be a sad day if we, as parliamentarians, allowed ourselves to be pushed into a corner on this issue. I am well along the road of suggesting to the Minister that he should look at the possibility of controlled experiments, with grounds being able to sell beer—I would not go so far as to include spirits—in soft containers inside the ground itself. This was the main reason why I made the point about social clubs selling drink inside the grounds.<br><br>
There should be some flexibility in the designation orders. Where a club or an organisation can prove that it has gone out of its way to ensure that supporters coming to its ground can buy lager or beer in soft containers under controlled experimental conditions, the designation order placed on that organisation and that ground should be different from the designation order placed on a ground that has no intention of co-operating to try to solve the problem. The Government will readily concede that politicians cannot solve this problem on their own. We need the cooperation of the clubs and of the spectators. There is no doubt about that.<br><br>
I do not want to give the impression that there is total unanimity of feeling on the measures being introduced, or even on the contents of the report produced by my hon. Friend. I went to visit the committee that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) was chairing. Although my visit does not appear in the report, I understand that that was due to protocol. When one Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1380</span>
ment Minister goes to a committee chaired by another Minister, the tactics are not to mention the fact. The Under-Secretary of State will learn that.<br><br>
I tried to persuade the clubs that there was a much simpler way of dealing with the matter. It was for the clubs themselves to reserve the right of entry. I do not want to be too critical of football clubs but I must say that I did not find them very willing to take as much responsibility as they should, in my view, be taking.<br><br>
Let us look at other organisations and events which people attend. Large crowds of youngsters go to dance halls, which reserve the right of admission. They can say "No, you're not coming in here", and if someone seeks to go in and the police are called, obviously the charge is a breach of the peace.<br><br>
In that sense we are not creating new offences. However, one of the doubts I have about this part of the Bill is that we are creating new offences. Once offences are created, as the Minister knows from his own legal experience, people expect offences to be enforced. While I support the Government in part V of the Bill and express the hope that part V will work in curbing much of the hooliganism at football matches throughout Scotland, I see difficulties in the enforcement of this part of the Bill. I am sure that, in his honest moments, the Minister will agree with me.<br><br>
I return briefly to the question of designation. Anyone reading the <i>Sporting Post</i> on a Saturday night will see that the average attendance at second division games is no more than 500 people. The number of spectators at such games has dropped dramatically. I should hesitate before designating grounds such as Forfar Athletic or Brechin City.<br><br>
However, there may be occasions when Forfar Athletic or Brechin City play Aberdeen, for instance. Not only is Aberdeen a premier league club but it is closely linked to Forfar and Brechin, and one would get the local derby flavour as well as the added attraction of a premier league club playing a second division club. In that situation the Government would be right to look at the position that would be likely to arise. Nevertheless, I do not believe that there would be much sense— and even less justice—in designating grounds such as Station Park at Forfar or Glebe Park at Brechin.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0808">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1381</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for giving way. Unfortunately subsection (2) implies that if clubs such as Forfar or Brechin, mentioned by my hon. Friend, were drawn against Aberdeen in the first round of the cup, the time scale between the draw and the match might be too small to allow an order to be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the technical difficulties of the 40-day period between an order being placed and consideration being given by Parliament. But it is not beyond the wit of those responsible for such matters to come up with an alternative proposal. Under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the regional authority has power to designate a particular ground for a particular event on a particular day. Not only has the authority power to designate the ground, it also has power to control the crowd limit entering that ground.<br><br>
One of the great arguments which went on last season concerned the cost involved. Regional authorities faced with escalating costs are charging more for the orders that clubs are having to request. There could be other ways of dealing with the problem that would meet the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton).<br><br>
I am worried that the Brechins, the Forfars and the Cowdenbeaths of this world will become victims of the big matches I put it no higher than that. I do not want to name clubs in the premier league. The trouble spots in football ought not to inflict their problems and the penalties that they have to endure on the football grounds where small numbers of people still get pleasure in going along and standing in safety to see the matches.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will think about what I have said. The redeeming feature is that we shall come back to the matter. I hope that the Minister will have further thoughts before a statutory instrument is laid.<br><br>
Finally, there is the question of the time scale. Does the Minister think that there is a possibility of the provisions being introduced for the start of the new football season in August, or will it be well into 1981 before anything can be done in relation to the designation of sports grounds? Bearing in mind the timetable of the Bill and of the House, I suspect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1382</span>
that it will be well into the winter before the Bill is on the statute book, and that will take it well through the early part of the Scottish football season. I know that many people will be anxious about the timetable, as they will want time to readjust their policies, their thinking and their attitude to the problem.<br><br>
11.15a.m.<br><br>
Having said that, I hope against hope that the provisions will work. It is no longer a pleasure to go to some grounds; it is an ordeal. We are all under an obligation to try to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself, somewhat unusually, in agreement with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). His contribution has been constructive and in the interests of Scotland and of football.<br><br>
The football clubs in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have much to answer for. Paragraph 88 on page 16 of the report of the working group on Football Crowd Behaviour says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as primitive in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic amenities including adequate toilet accommodation … <i>We therefore recommend</i> that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That, more than anything, would help towards getting rid of some problems on football grounds. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In addition clubs must provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators and <i>we recommend accordingly.</i>"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 94 on page 17 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The players, as well as the clubs, have to bear their share of responsibility for ensuring that their behaviour on the field of play is always of a standard which will offer a good example to those on the terracing."</p></blockquote>
With my attitude to drink and drinking, I could easily fall into the category of being called a prohibitionist. I am not a prohibitionist; quite the contrary. Indeed, there is much to be said for having adequate, properly controlled facilities, whether at football matches or anywhere else. It is only right that those who wish to take "a wee dram" should have the opportunity to do so. But that is not the problem.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0809">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1383</span>
The problem is that drink has become a virility symbol with the young. I relate that to the problem of carrying offensive weapons. That, too, is a virility symbol. I believe that both the prohibition of unsatisfactory individuals from the grounds and the search for offensive weapons that can take place outside the grounds would be constructive and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, it is extremely important that the hon. Member remembers the discussion on the question of search and the Minister's statement. The hon. Gentleman cannot go back on the old shibboleth that the legislation will allow unrestricted search. It is crucially important that we do not add to the myth about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not suggested that there would be indiscriminate search. But if individuals who are known to carry offensive weapons and who have a bad reputation approach football grounds and expect to be searched, that would be a deterrent, as it would be if the club were to refuse them admission.<br><br>
Let us not kid ourselves. In Brechin City, St. Johnstone or anywhere else, the rowdies and troublemakers are well known locally, and of course they can be stopped from entering the ground. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) was right—the clubs, the spectators and the public must co-operate in this matter.<br><br>
We in Perth have had our troubles with football rowdies—they are not restricted to the major grounds of Scotland—and we want a solution to the problem. There are people in Perth and its areas who wish to go to football matches, who want to see football played and who want sensible legislation to make it possible, once again, for a family to go to a match. I should never dream of taking my daughters to a football match, and I find that tragic, because I am interested in football.<br><br>
We hope to produce something here that will make a move towards making the clubs and others involved recognise that they, too, have a responsibility, and that it does not only lie with Parliament to find the answers. The answers will be found in the clubs, with the spectators and with the public. Parliament can only produce legislation to help.<br><br>
I sincerely hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will recognise the concern
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1384</span>
of us all when he considers the matter. There is no simplistic answer but, hopefully these provisions, largely based as they are on this report, will go some way towards improving the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the trigger clause for the rest of this part of the Bill. Before turning to the major theme of my speech, I ask two questions. The first may seem slightly frivolous but it has a partially serious intent. Once we have designated a ground, the sale of alcohol or the carriage of any cans, bottles and so no, within the ground is to be illegal. Will that cover the directors' drinking den at the back of the stand? In other words, will the directors not then be able to get a drink?<br><br>
On the few occasions that I may visit Queen's Park, for which I have a directors' box ticket, shall I not have a drink offered to me when I am one of 20 or 30 people present in the whole ground? That is a minor and slightly joking point but I think that it requires an answer, because the Opposition would not like to see a differentiation of class, as it were, between those who own the football ground and run the club and those who pay money to be admitted.<br><br>
My second question is more serious. Who will pay for the policing? At present, I understand that the clubs pay for the policing of a match. I confess that I am not certain how far out from the ground the policing extends, and whether it is merely the police within the ground for which the club pays, while the regional authority pays for the police who direct the traffic into the ground. But we are now to have a statutory law on behaviour within the grounds, for which, presumably, there must be enforcement, and that requires police. Does that mean that the cost of the police within the ground is to be transferred to the regional authority instead of being paid, as it is now, by the football club or the football association?<br><br>
This is an important point, because many local ratepayers may have an objection to this part of the Bill if they are to bear the burden of paying for extra policemen at grounds in order to enforce the law. The percentage of people who actually attend football matches in, say, the Strathclyde region, is comparatively small, and those who do not attend might object to this. I hope that the Minister can answer that point.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0810">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1385</span>
I turn now to what in many ways is the major issue. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), I have some reservations about whether we are doing no more than adding a few extra offences to the statute book, which may have little effect in controlling crowd behaviour at football matches. We shall merely finish up with higher offence statistics at the end of the year. However, I had general support for what this part of the Bill sought to do.<br><br>
During this week I have had increasingly less respect for it and desire to support it. Yet again in the Bill the Government are attempting to solve what are essentially social problems by punitive action instead of by tackling their causes. If we could see clause 66 as part of an overall design to solve the problems of football hooliganism, I would give it my support. But, as a result of this week's action, we have now seen that this seems to be the Government's only answer to football hooliganism, particularly at the major football ground in Scotland—Hampden Park.<br><br>
Hampden Park—which the Minister rightly says the Government will designate —is a slum. It is not fit for human beings to go to. By designating Hampden Park and trying to solve the problems purely by stopping people from drinking instead of building it up to a correct standard—the McElhone report makes it clear that all football stadiums should be brought up to a certain level, not only by stopping people coming in with drink, but in the toilet facilities, the seating and all the rest—the Government appear to be relying on this clause and this part of the Bill to cure the problems of football hooliganism. In my view it just will not work. This part of the Bill must be seen as part of an overall strategy to solve the problem, one aspect of which must be to improve the facilities at the sporting grounds.<br><br>
The clause continues to treat those who go to football matches as hooligans and vandals. If the facilities at the ground treat people as animals, people will behave like animals. If, however, human beings are treated as human beings by being given facilities—that has been proved time and time again with social reforms in this century—they will act like human beings.<br><br>
I shall probably not oppose the clause or this part of the Bill, but after the Government's statement on Hampden I have grave reservations, because I feel that they are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1386</span>
trying to tackle the problem of crowd behaviour purely by punitive measures, instead of by ameliorating conditions in the grounds. I would not like to push too hard by saying that the Government's standard of moral behaviour in breaching an understanding made two weeks ago is appalling, but I have increasing reservations about using purely punitive measures to solve deep-rooted problems.</span></p>
<p>11.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of my somewhat eccentric approach to the Thomson committee report, I have read the report of the McElhone working group. That was mainly because there were no lawyers on the working group. I therefore deduced to begin with that there must be some sense in it, but also because the many organisations and individuals from whom oral evidence was taken—here is a McElhonism— included four punters. I deduced, therefore, that their views were worthy of consideration. Having now read it, I see that they certainly were.<br><br>
But, having read the report, I appreciate —as my hon. Friends have said—the difficulty of taking action by legislation. I can see the problem facing the Minister and the Government. Whoever drafted the Bill has, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said, done his best to take out of the McElhone report the matters that can be dealt with by legislation. But I have reservations about whether they will be effective.<br><br>
We have seen, for instance, in Ayr recently how hooliganism can occur because people come down from Glasgow unconnected in any way with the football match. The McElhone report, with its complicated formula for working out offences per 100 hours of football, and comparing that with other leisure activities, makes the important point that football may not be the only, or the worst, kind of leisure activity resulting in violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On which page?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Appendix C, page 24. That proves, even more efficiently, that I have read the report.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the underlying problems. He and I and others have said, in this Committee and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0811">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1387</span>
elsewhere, that there are underlying problems—unemployment among young people, lack of leisure opportunities and so on—creating the problems that make vandalism, violence and other forms of anti-social behaviour more likely. As I have said before, and I merely underline today, the Government are exacerbating the problem by their public expenditure cuts, in which the Under-Secretary of State is the front man for Scotland.<br><br>
But I am deviating from clause 66, Mr. Gourlay. I support the clause, but I believe that it will not be as effective as some of the other measures which are glossed over in the McElhone report. I shall mention briefly five measures that I think would be much more effective.<br><br>
First—merely to reiterate what the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart said—there is the environment of the football ground. We all underestimate the importance of environment on human activity. In my wasted years at Edinburgh University, I occasionally studied some psychology, which instilled into me the importance of the environment on our activities. We see it here in Parliament, in the way in which we respond to different situations. I agree with recommendations 50 to 55 of the report relating to the separation of football supporters. The clear implication of separation at the grounds that we are to designate is that the supporters are being treated like cattle. That is necessary because of the environment of some grounds. In the grounds where people are treated like human beings, they act much more like human beings. Where they are treated like cattle they act like cattle.<br><br>
We know what cattle do. A few years ago, I took a visitor from the developing world to see a football match at Celtic Park. I was astonished, and he was amazed, at the primitive conditions at Celtic Park. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire mentioned toilet facilities. They are totally absent there. A wall constitutes the toilet facilities at Celtic Park. That is outrageous in the fourth quarter of the twentieth century. One hears of millions of pounds being spent in transfer fees for a football player. The money ought to be put into improving facilities for the spectators.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1388</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to intervene in the hon. Gentleman's remarks. They are very interesting but we must come back to the purpose of clause 66. It does not give us an opportunity to discuss the whole range of football activities and the type of stands and grounds. Whilst I do not mind small references or analogies being drawn, I would not want a long discussion on that aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate and accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. I was trying to prove that clause 66 is the main provision—as someone described it, the trigger clause—put forward by the Government to deal with sporting events and violence and vandalism at such events. If this is what the Government say will be the solution, we must talk about the alternatives. I shall try to abide by your ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not in order to discuss alternatives. This is the Bill as it was passed by the House of Commons. The question before the Committee is whether the clause as it stands should remain in the Bill or whether it should be excised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Gourlay. I am following on what other hon. Members have said. I have referred in most instances to matters referred to previously by speakers but putting different interpretations on them and extrapolating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue that line, it may come within the rule of tedious repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in terrible difficulty. I am beginning to suspect that a lawyer is in the Chair, or at least that we are being given legal advice. I will try to continue.<br><br>
I think that the clause ought not to be in the Bill. It will not be effective because it does not deal, for example, with the way in which individual football players are revered by young people and the way in which their attitude is conditioned by the players. My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart told me outside the Committee that he appeared on the platform with a football player and that the football player received all the adulation—not the hon. Member for Glasgow,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0812">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1389</span>
Cathcart. Yet he is one of the most well-known and revered politicians in Scotland.<br><br>
The actions of the football players, on and off the field, affect crowd behaviour. Much more effective than clause 66 would be for football players to set a good example. We know how much the advertising men realise the power of the footballers, who are often shown in television advertisements.<br><br>
I am glad to see that the Solicitor-General for Scotland is back because I can now quote a poem. I only do such erudite things when I know that he is here to keep me right when I go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A Latin poem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foukes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an English poem. My five year old son returned from nursery school the other day and repeated a poem which proves the effect of football upon even a child of that age. It is:
<br><blockquote><p>"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall watching Ayr United.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Ayr United scored a goal and Humpty was delighted.</p></blockquote>
If five-year-olds, returning from primary school, repeat, word-perfect, such rhymes, it proves the effect of football upon young people—even more than the effect of my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart. My second point, then, is that footballers should be setting an example to young people both on and off the field.<br><br>
My third point, which I think should be included in the clause, is the role of supporters' clubs. They are grossly underestimated by the report, by the football clubs and by everyone involved in football. If we gave them an official role it would be much more effective.<br><br>
We have talked of the effect of drink. My fourth point is that we are allowing sponsorship of sporting events, fixtures, and the whole league and SFA competition by drink firms, and at the same time are concerned about the effect of drink in these designated sports grounds and sporting events under clause 66.<br><br>
I hesitate to make my final point because there is a conflict of interest, and I know that the Lord's Day Observance Society and the Free Church of Scotland might not be too happy with it, but I wonder how much improvement there would be if our main sporting fixtures took place on a Sunday as they do in Europe. We might have fewer problems.<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that I have not deviated too much from clause 66. I was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1390</span>
trying to show that I recognise that the Minister has a difficult task in trying to do anything about this major problem by legislation. I have therefore some reservations about clause 66. However, given that I think that the Minister is bringing it in with the best intentions, I shall support the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have learnt some remarkable things. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) reads and, it appears, also writes, poetry. I suspect that he was the author of the work of literary distinction with which he honoured us. Also my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) becomes a revered public figure in Scotland. It is not the word that I should have chosen myself, although I have great respect for my colleague.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which word would the hon. Member choose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a limited vocabulary and I shall not be tempted, but it would —of course—have been entirely complimentary.<br><br>
I echo my hon. Friend's doubts about this part of the Bill, and particularly this clause upon which all depends. I do not oppose it. That would be ludicrous, because we are facing a real problem. Much work has gone into the report, which has come up with a series of statutory solutions which we all hope will have some marginal use. But we are paying a considerable price for this, and there is a danger that we may end in an ever-increasing spiral of non-attendance.<br><br>
We have commented on attendances at football grounds. The designation which we are discussing in clause 66 is—despite the cosmetic inclusion of Murrayfield— really a clause about football and football violence, and is unashamedly so.<br><br>
Attendances have contined to deteriorate, and although this clause may do something to suppress the disorder which has so worried us, which has been brought into all our homes by television, if not by our attendance at matches, it will do so at a price of making attendance at football matches less pleasant. It may be that the football clubs will find that an atmosphere of an event under siege will be created if the powers in the Bill are used to their full by the police. It is a sad and seedy business, that we have been forced to bring in these provisions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0813">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1391</span>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire—and with almost everyone who has spoken in this short debate—that a great deal of the problem lies with the football clubs, and with football supporters. I am not here referring to those who might be the object of the attentions of the police at football matches The whole atmosphere of football is open to criticism.<br><br>
The incredible and inordinate confidence of success of the Scottish football supporter is maintained in the face of all evidence to the contrary about the standing of our national team, and, indeed, some of our club teams. This confidence is encouraged by the gentlemen of the press, and does much to produce a feeling of bitter anticlimax after matches which spills over into violence on the pitch.<br><br>
There are features of the Scottish football scene, into which we cannot venture, such as disciminatory signing policies by well-known clubs, and the activities of managers who even after winning a trophy for the <i>n</i>th time still jump about the pitch like banshees at the final whistle. This creates the atmosphere which perhaps gives a licence or tacit encouragement to fans to act in a way that has forced us to bring on to the statute book measures which are openly repressive.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I do not agree with the remarks of my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart when he diffidently spoke of the social drink in the directors' box. I, too, sometimes attend second division football matches. I make no bones about the fact that one of the pleasures is to go to a reasonably comfortable office with some reasonably civilised company and be offered refreshment. That is part of the outing—an innocent part. But on a plain man's reading of part V, that civility will have to end.<br><br>
There is a more wide-ranging problem of the inevitably wide drawing of the term "container". I presume that the traditional cup of bovril will not be covered as long as it is a plastic cup. Presumably it is something which, if propelled against a person, would not be capable of causing harm. When I have taken my children to football matches it has been possible to buy soft drinks which will clearly be in controlled containers and will be ruled out.<br><br>
There will be an atmosphere in desig-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1392</span>
nated grounds of almost military surveillance with the cutting back of a lot of the normal extras to an outing to a football match. That is very unfortunate.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with what was said earlier, namely, that this is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There is also a danger about the considerable powers of search and the possession of items that would normally be innocent, but because they could fall into the category of "controlled containers", become sinister by definition, and per se an offence that could attract a gaol sentence. These are all unfortunate aspects of the problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) specifically said that he envisaged that there would normally be searches outside a football ground. We shall deal with that later. I give the Minister notice that we shall be looking for some assurance from the Minister as to how the powers of search in clause 73 are likely to be exercised. It all adds up to making a football match a thoroughly unpleasant ordeal rather than a pleasurable family outing.<br><br>
The final point I wish to make in expressing my reservations is that this is a series of measures that should be put on the statute book on a trial basis. We may find that the trouble at football matches continues. The kind of searches that take place outside grounds, the incidents that may attend supporters' buses on the way to grounds or within the confines of the ground itself, and the problem of finding and defining controlled containers may itself give rise to friction.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will monitor how this is working out as time passes. One of the most horrific things about legislation is that once it is on the statute book, it is there to stay. It is very difficult to get a new offence repealed. Later in this Bill we will be debating legislation that has been on the statute book since 1824 and is of doubtful validity. There is a sort of inertia which afflicts legislation. Once it is in our statutes no one finds time to repeal it and the temptation even to monitor it is severely resisted by Ministers.<br><br>
If it is clear that the aggravation and friction arising from the provisions outweighs the benefit from them I hope that the Minister will have the courage to say "We have looked at the matter. It has not been a particularly useful experiment. At best, it does not seem to have had beneficial effects; at worst it may have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0814">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1393</span>
harmful. In the circumstances we propose to take part V out of the Act.<br><br>
Designation of sports grounds should be very much on trial. We should not make the mistake of saying that if the legislation does not work and there are still outrages such as we have seen recently in Scottish football grounds, we should leave the provision on the statute book or try to enforce it more severely and fiercely. In that way we might encourage a tribalist and masochistic view of football—a trial of strength between sectarian factions— which has little to do with a sporting event or a pleasant afternoon's recreational outing.<br><br>
While I would not vote against clause 66 —I do not suppose that any member of the Committee will vote against it—I regard it as a slightly doubtful experiment. I treat it with an enthusiasm so muted that it might be misunderstood as being a different form of emotional response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in speaking to the clause. It was inevitable that there would be a wide ranging discussion because the clause is the trigger mechanism of part V. It is important that in accepting the trigger we look at the bullet.<br><br>
No one should under-estimate the importance of football in Scotland. Those of us who lived through the strange experience of the Scottish involvement in the World Cup will recognise its importance. When Scotland lost its first game the sense of gloom that fell upon the Scottish psyche was extremely widespread. It may be argued that in Scotland it becomes a surrogate—more than sex or religion— for the failure to give political expression to a national identity. That is the argument of the Scottish Nationalists. There is some truth in that football occupies this role in Scotland in a way that applies in no other country. Despite the keenness of the Italian and Spanish fans there is no such equation. Consequently, it is also important with regard to what happens at Scottish football matches.<br><br>
In one sense, we ought encourage an even greater involvement in football so that more people can enjoy it. By removing football from what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in a striking phrase referred to as a masochistic trial of" sectarian strength, and by increasing its importance as a spectator Sport which is part of our leisure activities, we would decrease the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1394</span>
extremely black role of football in acting as a surrogate in the Scottish psyche.<br><br>
What happens on our football fields matters. When it is seen that an expression of sectarianism and violence becomes a normal part of many young people's Saturday afternoons, that affects Scotland as a whole. The Bill does not attempt to use ameliorative measures or to adopt a positive approach but to see what measure is appropriate in a negative way, beginning with the designation of certain grounds.<br><br>
Consequences will flow from that If we use the concept of designation, perhaps we should also begin to consider how we inject into that concept positive support in order to improve the situation. Clubs have an immense responsibility, but Scottish clubs do not have an immense amount of money. The few hundred spectators who attend week after week at many of the clubs makes such improvement impossible. As we are moving into a period of increasing leisure, a positve response from the Government is required to make football a pleasurable part of the leisure time that, willy-nilly, society will have.<br><br>
Three points on the role of the clubs were referred to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) which are worth picking up. Paragraph 91 of the report on football crowd behaviour refers to pre-match entertainment. In the United States, for example, soccer, as opposed to American football, is now growing as a spectator sport. I have not been to such a match myself, although I have seen it on film. Everyone tells me that it is a family excursion; it lasts longer than the game. There are other events, such as displays, parades and fun for the kids in an atmosphere which does not arouse this masochistic trial of strength. Obviously our smaller club cannot afford this kind of display, but they can put on events which people like.<br><br>
Throughout the summer, when kids of 9 and 10 play football in the park, one finds a number of men watching the game because they are dying to see another game of football. They say "Go on, kids, hassle him" and all the rest, and the kids try to imitate the football behaviour that they have seen on television.<br><br>
Five-a-side football with school teams is a marvellous game. The kids are so enthusiastic, as anyone will agree who saw the best football match that has been played in Britain this year—the schoolboy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0815">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1395</span>
international between Scotland and England. It was a credit to our youngsters and a credit to football and a better game than any international match that I have seen this year, including the present round in Europe, for sheer enthusiasm and skill. Therefore, the five-a-side game of itself can help create the right atmosphere.<br><br>
With regard to the public address system, the management puts up a loudspeaker and goes through the formalities of an announcement, but no one hears it. Not sufficient money is spent on public address systems.<br><br>
Finally, I come to the point made by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). Of course going to a football match is a masochistic experience. We know of the disgusting habits that take place because of the lack of toilets. If I may illustrate the point, Mr. Gourlay, three or four years ago I invited to Scotland a girl from BBC television who wanted to see something of the Scottish scene. A friend took her to see a Glasgow football match. It was in January. She came back very, very cold. Fortunately she had long thigh boots on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How did my hon. Friend know that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She had long thighs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked: "How did you get on? Did you like the singing?" She said, "Yes, the singing was marvellous, but it was freezing cold. At half-time I found myself freezing and up to my ankles in piss." This is exactly the experience that people go through. We all know it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) says that if we treat people like animals they will behave like animals. This behaviour is disgusting and has to stop. Therefore, entertainment, public address systems, toilets and things of that kind must be all be improved, but something else follows from that.<br><br>
If we are to place football properly in its position as playing an important part in sporting development, our leisure activities, the training of our youngsters and so on, we should copy one thing from the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. As most people know, there is little which I would praise in that direction. But their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1396</span>
major football teams are associated with sporting clubs, so thousands of people come to Moscow Dynamo as a sports centre where they can participate. The Government should consider this possibility seriously.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) originated the idea of kids going round to the senior teams, meeting the players, being trained and so on. We should be doing this on a massive scale, using the team as the end-point of the sports centre's activity instead of letting it isolate itself as this symbol of Rangers, Celtic or whoever it might be. Because it is important to Scotland, it would be worth the money that should be spent on it.<br><br>
We know how youngsters watch and admire players. It is true that, specially within the designated grounds, the behaviour of the players matters. Sometimes we are unfair. Sometimes it is the attitude of supporters that forces certain styles of behaviour upon the players. I regretted very much that the Secretary of State for Scotland criticised the Celtic players at the time of the Scottish Cup Final. They made a very natural and spontaneous response to their own spectators: they moved towards them with their arms up. Immediately there was an invasion from the other side to which their own supporters responded. It is tragic that players cannot even acknowledge this kind of thing from their supporters without precipitating a riot. I cannot blame the players for that. They did not do it in a provocative way. They went towards their own supporters. It was regrettable that it should have been mentioned in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, know that a man was convicted of breach of the peace for shaking the hand of Mr. Jimmy Johnson when he scored a goal, and Lord Wheatley pronounced it an extremely serious offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For scoring the goal? I do not see the validity of that point to what I am saying. [<i>Interruption</i>]. There are depths within the matter that I am not following.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glas-goe, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was saying that he was disregarded because he was alongside a prominent footballer. I had to do the honours at a Scotland versus Wales schoolboys' international. They said, "Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0816">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1397</span>
Buchan. Is Martin Buchan here?" The kids were very disappointed when I appeared, 5 ft. 5¾ ins. with glasses.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) referred to a poem. There are songs throughout Scotland, such as the following which uses the tune of the Red Flag:
<br><blockquote><p>"Oh, Charlie Shaw, you never saw<br><br> Where Alan Morton pit the baw".</p></blockquote>
Then there is the most glorious of all rhymes, about the selling of Willie Waddell:
<br><blockquote><p>"How can you well Willie Waddell<br><br> The left fit, the right fit, the nooddle".</p></blockquote>
That is the best rhyme in the whole folk culture. These things matter. We have to develop a positive response.<br><br>
Television has precipitated much change in football. The hugging and demonstrating by the players comes partly from that. Another song says that in the old days it was much better:
<br><blockquote><p>"There wis nae 4,2,2,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There wis nae 3,3,4,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>An 'yer pals didnae kiss ye</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Whenever ye scored."</p></blockquote>
Things have changed. We should take a positive response because of the importance placed on this matter.<br><br>
Among the designated grounds is Hampden Park, the very centre and symbol of our football, yet the Government in the words of the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> formally renege on their commitment. They must go back on that. They must show a positive response to Hampden Park, and begin to make football an expression of general sporting activity instead of leaving it to become the trigger point for the worst of young sectarian violence, which will spread to other parts of Scotland.<br><br>
It is right to designate more than the large grounds. I accept what was said about Perth by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). Often, in small towns, the supporters hear about the behaviour of the big town supporters, and they behave worse themselves to show that they are as big. I matters that we should designate the whole group.<br><br>
I do not think that we can leave it at that. I am sceptical, but I am prepared to go along with the Government because we must do something. However, concomitant with the designation of grounds
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1398</span>
as laid down in the clause should be a positive attitude and money from the Government in the recognition that the future will bring increasing leisure. If we allow the present atmosphere to continue, it may get worse. we have to inject a positive attitude, both to reduce the importance of football in sectarian terms and to enhance it as a proper expression of athleticism and sporting activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a worthwhile debate. I congratulate Labour Members any my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), who have contributed to it. I thank hon. Members for their welcome to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A cautious welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cautious though it may be, it was nevertheless a welcome, and Governments are always grateful for unanimity, particularly when it comes to the vote on a clause.<br><br>
I did not suggest in my introductory remarks, nor have I suggested at any stage, that the Government believe these proposals to be the solution to the problems of hooliganism, vandalism and drunken behaviour at football grounds. However, I believe—and that is the reason why I think that the Committee will welcome these provisions—that they indicate the response that Parliament is able to make, thereby contributing towards a solution to the problems.<br><br>
Much of the solution must lie with the clubs. The clubs of the Premier League and the other divisions in Scotland have the means at their disposal, if they wish to use them, to improve their facilities and their way of dealing with this problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) was right to say that many of the clubs have failed to live up to their responsibility of ensuring that the facilities in their establishments, for which they charge admission and for which, therefore, they have primary responsibility, should meet decent, reliable standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that Hampden Park is unique? It is owned by one of the small clubs in Scotland and the attendances do not provide sufficient revenue to enable improvements to be made.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0817">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1399</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but I think that the hon. Member for Cathcart will appreciate that his constituents who live in the vicinity of Hampden Park were delighted at the Government's recent announcement about that ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my constituents are pleased with the result, but they are still concerned that big matches will be played there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I saw on television constituents of his who were campaigning for the Government to withdraw support from the Hampden Park project.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked about the timetable. We must wait until the Bill is on the statute book. There has to be consultation with the various interested bodies and an order has to be laid before Parliament. I think one must accept that it is highly unlikely that this measure will come into effect until the early part of next year. The Government intend to make speedy progress on the implementation of these proposals, subject to the approval of Parliament.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised a possibility that is set out in the McElhone report— namely, that alcohol might be made available in paper cups in football grounds, notwithstanding the general prohibition provided in the Bill. As a long-term objective, that may be a desirable and civilised way of dealing with the problem of alcohol, but our intention and objective now should be to try to break the link between alcohol and football matches. It is preferable at this stage that the prohibition be a general one if not for the reasons that I have already indicated but for the additional factor that there would be something rather unusual and odd about a prohibition on alcohol in coaches travelling to grounds that did not apply the provision of alcohol at the grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made what is probably the most important statement of the debate by saying that it is the Government's desire and intention to break the link between alcohol and football. Have the Minister and his Department pleaded with the Scottish Football Association to stop accepting sponsorship by Bell's whisky and Younger's the brewers? Will the Minister consider informing the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1400</span>
Scottish health education unit that the Government will provide, say, £100,000 for it to sponsor the Scottish Cup, thereby giving it free advertising inside the grounds, and using that sponsorship as a means of counter-advertising the effects of alcohol at sports grounds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no strong feelings about the hon. Gentleman's point. I think that he is rather forcing it. He will be aware that, rightly or wrongly, alcohol interests sponsor many sporting events apart from football matches. Many of the matches that they sponsor do not have any problems connected with alcohol and drunken behaviour, so I think that that is a false connection. However, that is a matter that the clubs concerned will wish to take into account.<br><br>
I emphasise that our long-term objective is that it should be possible to have a normal civilised drink in a football stadium as anywhere else, but at this stage priority must be given to try to break the link to which I have referred. That is why the Bill is drafted in its present form.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) suggested that the inclusion of Murrayfield had been suggested merely for cosmetic reasons. He appears to have the support of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in making that rather unfair suggestion. I merely refer him to the attitude of the Scottish Rugby Union, which in a letter to the Scottish Office stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"My Committee have asked me to make strong representations to the effect that Murrayfield should be one of the designated grounds at the outset. We do have problems of drink being brought into our ground, problems which have been increasing in recent years."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Rugby Union has asked that Murrayfield be included as a designated ground. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue this suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When Murrayfield is designated, will the hon. Gentleman ensure that this law is enforced rigorously on all parts of the ground, including the stand and the car park? Secondly, will he ensure that his hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland does not carry his cane with drinking cup on top when he attends a rugby match at Murrayfield?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions of the Bill will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0818">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1401</span>
applied to any designated ground, whether it be for rugby or football matches, in exactly the same way. I know that my hon. and learned Friend will be foremost in his desire to show by his example the need to observe to the letter the law of the land. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take great comfort from that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should remember that I have powers of prosecution.<br><br>
May I advise the members of the Committee, for their own safety, that when I go to a rugger match at Murrayfield I am a controlled container?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that my hon. and learned Friend is not only a controlled container but one capable of causing injury in terms of clause 20.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), true to his egalitarian principles, is anxious to know whether the directors' box will be included in these provisions. You, Mr. Gourlay, were anxious to indicate that the answer to that question is already in the Bill. Clause 75 refers to "relevant area," which is denned as:
<br><blockquote><p>"any part of a sports ground—
<ol>
<li>to which spectators attending a designated sporting event are granted access on payment; or</li>
<li>from which a designated sporting event may be viewed directly".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
As the directors' box is an area from which the match may be viewed directly, clearly the consumption of alcohol in the directors' box would be forbidden. That would come within the normal controls.<br><br>
There are rooms within most sports-grounds from which the match cannot be viewed and which are not available to the general public. They are private rooms, often for the use of the members of the teams. As long as the area in question comes within the definition of "relevant area" under paragraphs (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), the prohibition will apply. That will cover the directors' box.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked who would pay for the police who will be required for this purpose. We do not envisage any increase in the number of police that will be required. There are already significant numbers of police, and the changes in the Bill relate only to the powers that they can exercise when they are present at grounds.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1402</span>
The numbers involved is a matter for discussion between the chief constable and the football authorities. The cost of the police that are thought to be required will fall upon the football authorities. That is the present position, and no change is contemplated as a result of the provisions of the Bill. The football authorities cover the cost of any police thought to be necessary.<br><br>
Those were the specific questions raised by hon. Gentlemen in the debate. I emphasise again that we are considering the response that Parliament can make as a major contribution towards dealing with the problem of drunkenness and hooliganism at football matches in Scotland. I am glad that hon. Members, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, have indicated their support for the provision. I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am both loth to speak again, Mr. Gourlay, but I must say that the Minister made what I consider to be a serious allegation against what I said— that I say different things in this Committee from what I say to my constituents. I resent that. It is not true. One of his hon. Friends produced one letter in evidence, in regard to one clause, but the only letter I have so far received from a constituent was against what the Government did about Hampden.<br><br>
In my view, Hampden is an either-or situation—either it is redeveloped or it is closed. The point has been reached where the Government have to make up their minds on the matter—which I have consistently said.</span></p>

<p>Government amendment No. 275.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to the two Government amendments within this group and reserve comments upon the Opposition amendments until they have been spoken to.<br><br>
The first Government amendment is intended to provide an amended description of the class of vehicles to which the controls on the carriage of alcohol will apply under this part in order to take account of changes introduced by the Transport Bill, which is going through Parliament. The amendment will apply the controls to any public service vehicle as defined in the 1980 Transport Bill being operated for the principal purpose of conveying passengers to or from a designated sporting event and not simply, as at present, to contract carriages being used in this way.<br><br>
It seems sensible as long as the coach in question is being used for the purpose of conveying passengers to or from a designated sporting ground and sporting event. That is the basis on which the Bill is framed and it is obviously sensible to anticipate the provisions of the Transport Bill going through Parliament in order that we do not require subsequent technical amendment to this aspect in the future.<br><br>
The second amendment, No. 275, is simply a drafting amendment consequential on the amendment that I have just spoken to. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to amendment No. 318 and the associated amendments tabled in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), and myself.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1404</span>
I confess that when we tabled the amendment to include trains within the Bill's provisions, the position then in Scotland was that there was very little likelihood of trains being used as organised carriages for taking spectators to football matches. The normal practice is that someone going from Glasgow to Aberdeen travels by coach. But since the amendments were tabled a whole series of events have happened that have made the amendments much more important now than they were originally.<br><br>
I shall not stray out of the rules of order by speaking in great detail about Hampden Park, but there can be no doubt that the Government's disgraceful decision on Hampden Park has changed the situation. Yesterday I spent some time on the "World at One" programme with the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), who is claiming responsibility for going to the Prime Minister behind the backs of Ministers and persuading her to cancel the Hampden Park project against the wishes of his ministerial colleagues.<br><br>
Part of the hon. Member's argument was that the international football matches in Scotland should now be staged at different venues. He mentioned a number of cities. It is true that in a club match— say, Rangers playing Aberdeen—the supporters travel by coach from a variety of points. We all know that Rangers are supported—as are Celtic—by a population that is fairly widespread.<br><br>
In the case of an international football match being staged at Pittodrie, there is no doubt in my mind that special trains would be used as a means of conveying spectators from various points in Scotland to Aberdeen, for the simple reason that the number of buses travelling into Aberdeen, to convey the size of crowd that would go to an international football match as distinct from a club football match, could not be accommodated.<br><br>
I am certain that the authorities—the Grampian police and other authorities in Aberdeen—would want most of the crowd brought in by train because, having travelled in by a train which is to leave at half past five, one has to be on it then or have the devil's own job getting home. In my experience, trains have been much more effective than coaches in the dispersal of crowds after matches.<br><br>
Since we tabled the amendments events have occurred that have made the amendments even more important and necessary.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1405</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is purely a matter of record. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has alluded to comments alleged to have been made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). In fact, I was the first to make proposal the in the Chamber that we move the matches round Scotland. I also tabled the early-day motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The comments that I made about the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South were not directed to whether international matches should be moved round Scotland but to his claim that he went to the Prime Minister and had the Hampden project cancelled behind the Government's back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and to those who have made similar reference, I say categorically that the Prime Minister made no representations to either my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland or to any other Scottish Office Minister. Nor were any representations on the subject of Hampden Park made to my right hon. Friend or to any other Scottish Office Minister by any other member of the Government. I hope that that will finalise the absurd suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is not a member of the Government. I do not wish to intervene in the private battle between the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and his colleagues. If the Minister is denying the claim made by the hon. Member of Aberdeen, South, he must take it up with his hon. Friend and not with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) raised the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised the matter only because it is relevant to the amendment. It was repeated yesterday in my presence by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South. I do not go further than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The matter has been sufficiently ventilated and I hope that there will be no further references to it in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Gourlay. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1406</span>
should not have allowed myself to be misled by the Under Secretary of State, who in his usual way rose to mislead me all over the place and to get a nice young chap like me into trouble with the Chair. It is a new experience for me.<br><br>
I return to the amendments. They are much more important now than when they were first tabled. First, I hope that the Minister will recognise the sense of our proposals.<br><br>
There is a strong likelihood that international football matches will be moved round the various centres in Scotland. I am not arguing against that. That would not be bad. However, if that is to happen, the method of taking spectators to these venues will have to be examined closely. The authorities in whose areas the grounds are located will want to consider the methods by which spectators are brought in.<br><br>
As you will know from your own experience, Mr. Gourlay, it is not uncommon when there is a big match—in Kirkcaldy, for example, the Fife police do this—for the police to insist that all coaches leave by a certain time at night. It is all part of crowd dispersal policy after a sporting event.<br><br>
If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment now, he should give an undertaking that he will give further consideration to the matter and return to it on Report. There is a strong likelihood that special trains—not normal service trains—will be used to convey spectators to the football matches that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I intervened here. I fully appreciate much of what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has said about the difficulty that can be produced by alcohol being carried on trains, often similar to the difficulty caused when alcohol is carried on coaches.<br><br>
British Rail is fully aware of the problem created by those taking alcohol on certain trains—for example, football specials— and is actively pursuing amendment of its byelaws to enable it to ban alcohol on all such trains—not only in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The text of the proposed British Rail byelaw has now been agreed at official level in the Department of Transport, the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. British Rail expects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0821">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1407</span>
to be able to advertise the proposal in the next few weeks, following which it will be submitted to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport for formal approval. It is, therefore, hoped that the byelaws will become law by the end of the summer.<br><br>
I emphasise that the proposal does not involve a general prohibition on alcohol in trains, but would enable British Rail to ban the carriage of alcohol on special trains or on any train where there was reason to believe that the carriage of alcohol would create difficulties such as the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. Once the byelaw is imposed, it will, I assume, be an offence to seek to carry alcohol on a train where British Rail has used the powers under the byelaw.<br><br>
Although this is not a matter within the Criminal Justice Bill, a legal prohibition on alcohol on trains of that kind will now be available to British Rail. It has not had that power until now. I hope that that announcement will assure hon. Gentlemen that we fully share their view as to the importance of not excluding trains from this form of control and that the action that British Rail will now be able to take will make a major contribution to solving the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I am speaking immediately after the Minister, may I say that that announcement is very welcome? I became involved in the problem when one of my constituents last year was murdered on a train going to the Scotland-England match at Wembley. I am coming to the guidelines, and I still wish to make the point in a few moments, Mr. Gourlay, but that case would not have been dealt with by the Bill, according to what the Minister said earlier, because Wembley would not have been a designated sports ground under the Bill. The byelaw that the Minister now suggests for British Rail would deal with the recurrence of the problem, and I welcome that.<br><br>
I was looking carefully at paragraphs 46–48 of the McElhone report and also at appendix H, the letter to Mr. Hook from the chief operating manager of British Rail. The point that I wish to make I shall make now in relation to what the Minister has just said. I hope that the Government—and the Opposition, so far as we have responsibility for so doing— will ensure the speedy passage of any change in the byelaws of British Rail.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1408</span>
But I also hope that there will be impressed on British Rail the need for the strict enforcement of the byelaws. There are many byelaws in existence which are not strictly enforced.<br><br>
The letter to Mr. Hook, although it refers not to byelaws but to guidelines, says that
<br><blockquote><p>"all trains upon which football fans travel"</p></blockquote>
should
<br><blockquote><p>"Maintain close liaison with Police … ensure … smooth entry to trains … minimum inconvenience to other customers … Avoid overcrowding of trains … Discourage supporters under the influence of drink or who are carrying drink."</p></blockquote>
The reality of the situation is that the train on shich my constituent was killed was allowed by the British Rail authorities to leave Central Station, Glasgow already overcrowded with people standing in the corridors. People were allowed on the train carrying bottles of spirits in their pockets for consumption on the train. The train, already overcrowded, stopped at Kilmarnock, where my constituent and many more people were allowed to get on. The person concerned was killed on this side of the border, and the train did not stop until Warrington.<br><br>
It is clear that these guidelines were not in any way adhered to on that train. I hope that the Minister and the Government will go back to British Rail—before the byelaws take effect—and ask it to ensure that the guidelines are followed on the trains. Once the byelaws are passed, as I hope that they ultimately are, I trust that the Minister will make sure that British Rail enforces them strictly.<br><br>
The incident to which I am referring was quite appalling. Not only the murder but a number of stabbings took place on the train. People were stabbed indiscriminately by young thugs running up and down the corridors.<br><br>
This is perfectly true. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) would not have liked to be an ordinary passenger on that train and to have a knife stuck into his belly by the thugs on the train. But that happened, and British Rail did not stop the train until Warrington. It is intolerable for such a thing to happen in Britain today. I hope that the Government will take immediate action before the byelaws are eventually agreed.</span></p>

<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I say, Mr. Gourlay, before the Minister replies, that his statement was very helpful, and that in view of what he said, we do not intend to press our amendments?<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) referred to Stan Hook, and I think that it would be in order to place our tribute to Stan Hook on record. He died suddenly after the working party had completed its report. I should like to record, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), our appreciation of the services that Stan Hook gave to the committee and to express our sympathy at his sad and sudden loss.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 327, in page 47, leave outlines 9 to 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment it will be for the convenience of the Committee to take amendment No. 331, in clause 69, page 47, line 26, leave out "67(<i>b</i>) or".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment refers in particular to paragraph (<i>b</i>). The Committee can see that that paragraph includes in the list of those subject to penalties the person who may be organising a bus outing or a supporters' bus, if alcohol is carried on that bus. In those circumstances he may be guilty, and fined on summary conviction a sum "not exceeding £200".<br><br>
I do not need to labour this point, but as I understand the provision, it includes someone who might organise the bus as the secretary of a supporters' club and yet might not be on the bus himself but be sitting at home with the 'flu. Any combination of circumstances might prevent him from supervising the bus personally, but he is held responsible for what happens on it.<br><br>
I can see that the force of the argument is to bring home to supporters' clubs, or anyone else who organises a trip, that he is, and ought to be responsible for the policing of it to exclude alcohol. But I have doubts about the provision, and I should be interested in the Minister's comments. It is clear that if a person is caught with alcohol on his person, he is guilty of an offence under paragraph (<i>a</i>) which has a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1410</span>
term of imprisonment as one of the possible penalties.<br><br>
We must support the provision that the public service vehicle operator—the person holding the PSV licence—should have a certain responsibility for what happens on his bus.<br><br>
This is a matter of judgment. I am not happy that an organiser—who may have taken reasonable precautions, such as leaving the trip in charge of a colleague—may be caught under clause 67(<i>b</i>). My view is that it would not greatly weaken the provisions of the clause if that paragraph were removed. That is the purpose of my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will agree that one of our general objectives ought to be to encourage those in a leading position who are involved in arrangements for these matches to take more responsibility for what happens.<br><br>
The clause deals with an individual who may have hired a coach which is being used for carrying persons to a football ground. There is no basic reason why a hirer, once he has hired a vehicle in his name, should be devoid of all responsibility for what takes place on that vehicle, no doubt with his authority. Therefore it seemed to the Government that it was right that a hirer of a vehicle should have some responsibility to ensure that the law is observed on that vehicle.<br><br>
We accept that the hirer is not in the same position as the individual who may be consuming or carrying alcohol. For that reason the penalty for any breach of the clause is far less—it is a maximum fine, it does not give an alternative of imprisonment. That clearly reflects the different culpability of someone who has committed an offence under this clause.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that where the hirer was present on the vehicle and knowingly permitted one of the persons on the vehicle to carry alcohol, it would be wrong that he should be able to stand idly by and allow that to happen without any responsibility falling upon him, although he was the person who had hired the vehicle to which the prohibition applies.<br><br>
The hon. Gentlemen concerned seemed to be primarily where the hirer had a technical involvement but was not present or involved in the journey. However, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0823">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1411</span>
defence is available under clause 69 which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person is charged with an offence … it shall be a defence for him to prove that the alcohol was carried on the vehicle without his consent or connivance and that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage."</p></blockquote>
I maintain that that will cover the legitimate situation to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. A person who clearly did not know, or was not aware, or did not have reason to believe that alcohol was being carried, should be able to put forward an adequate defence. But it is right that the onus should be on him to do that.<br><br>
If alcohol is found to have been carried on the coach which he has hired, the hirer has to accept some responsibility for what takes place on that coach. If he can show that it was done without his knowledge and without his involvement, that is a perfectly legitimate defence which is available to him. If he is unable to show that, it does not seem inappropriate or against the public interest that he should accept some of the responsibility, and therefore be open to having committed an offence under the clause. That is the thinking behind the clause. There is no question of imprisonment for the hirer, however serious the offence, but simply a question of a fine. That appears to be a proper balanced approach to this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just stumbled against a slight complication. Although the Minister refers to an individual hiring a coach to take people to a football match, the normal practice is that coaches are hired by supporters' clubs or associations. We have a recent example of the Scottish Football Association setting up a Scottish football supporters' club in order to try to overcome the problem of allocation of tickets.<br><br>
What would happen if a supporters' club were to hire buses and appointed a steward for each bus? Who would be held responsible? Would it be the supporters' club? As a result of the legislation is there a danger that supporters' clubs could themselves be fined £200 for a breach of the condition laid down in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The obligation is imposed upon a person to whom the bus has been hired. "A person" means a legal person which would include a supporters' club. That is another reason why a fine would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1412</span>
more appropriate than any contemplation of imprisonment. Again, it would seem appropriate that if a supporters' club has hired a coach, unless it has available to it the defence that the carriage of alcohol was caused without its knowledge and connivance, it should be held responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the kind of debate that could be convoluted and could take us until tonight, but it will not. The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) raises is of some interest. Let us suppose that a supporters' club wishes to hire a coach and it contacts the bus hirer on behalf of the club. It may well be that in those circumstances it is the outings secretary who makes the contact and strikes the bargain on behalf of the club. Would the prosecution be taken against him or against the office bearers of the club? Obviously the club is not a legal persona. That is as clear as a pikestaff. Could the prosecution be brought against the secretary, the secretary and the office bearers or perhaps against the member of the committee who signed the contract and who was in charge of that outing? There is a grey area which it would be worth clearing up.<br><br>
I do not feel encouraged to push this matter to a Vote, but, of course, I was aware that there was a defence under clause 69. The Minister will be aware that there are later amendments in connection with that defence. I was fascinated almost by the words that the Minister used. He said that it would be a good defence if what happened on the bus occurred without the knowledge and involvement of the hirer. But it is much harder than that, because tacked on to the clause are the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister could say in this debate in the context of the hirer, what he thinks would meet that provision. What he said would be fair if the clause ended after "consent or connivance", but there is the additional bit—which there is un amendment to delete—which makes it a much harder test to meet than simply that it happened without his knowledge and involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point raised by the hon. Gentleman, it is not unusual to have obligations imposed upon corporate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0824">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1413</span>
bodies. In the particular case to which the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth referred if the hiring authority—in other words, the person who paid for the hire of the vehicle—was the club. The prosecution would be brought against the club, if that was the appropriate body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Against the office bearers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Against the club, in the same way as for any other breach of a statutory duty by the club.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never felt very much at ease with this subject, which is perhaps painfully obvious to the Minister. If it is a limited company and a legal persona, X Company Ltd. is sued as such. If it is merely a club—a gathering together of people with a constitution to run matches to Auchenshuggle Raith Rovers away games, wherever they may take place-presumably one cannot sue the Auchenshuggle Raith Rovers club because it is not a legal persona. Presumably the prosecution would have to be taken against the office bearers of the club. I want to be sure that that is the position. This is not civil liability, after all. It is a criminal prosecution in which a person can be fined and presumably will have previous convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there were to be a prosecution, as I understand it it would be against the individuals as office bearers of the club. If a fine was then imposed, it would be against the club and not paid out of the personal pockets of the office bearers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will look at this and write to me, because I am curious about, it. If the Auchenshuggle Raith Rovers supporters club is not a legal entity, I can see that, as secretary, I will get through the post a summons summoning me to Glasgow sheriff court as an individual and charging me with an offence under section 67 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980. At that point I appear and I put in, no doubt, a plea in mitigation. But the sheriff says that it is a serious matter, and there have been previous offences against this club—not against me during my time as office bearer, but perhaps during the previous secretary's time—and, in view of that, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1414</span>
court will impose the maximum of £200. If I do not pay that, do I go to prison for non-payment of the fine? The club cannot.<br><br>
The Minister may get out of this by saying that the court always has an option to make an order that civil diligence recovers it. I should have thought that the office bearer would be responsible for the fine and therefore there is—perhaps it is an obscure circumstance—at least a threat that non-payment might lead to a swelling of the jail population.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not creating a unique situation. The hon. Gentleman really wants information on the normal situation that applies when a corporate body such a club may be prosecuted.<br><br>
The first point that the hon. Gentleman should appreciate is that office bearers of the club are responsible for what happens in the name of the club. If there have been previous examples of breaches of this or any similar rule, clearly the office bearers would have an increased responsibility to ensure that the offence did not happen again, and it is right that that should be so. The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if the fine were not paid. The fine: would be imposed on individuals as officer bearers of the club. Clearly they are personally responsible, and ought to be responsible in the same way as anyone else, for non-payment of a penalty imposed on them. But it is imposed on them only in their capacity as office bearers of the club. As such they continue to be responsible. If they cease to be the office bearers two seconds after the fine is imposed, it may be the new office bearers who have to make sure that the fine is paid. That is a matter that I shall have to look into.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gets worse and worse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We are dealing here with a normal situation. It is not a new problem—I emphasise that. Clubs are occasionally in breach of licensing regulations and other regulations for which fines can be imposed. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman detailing the position but at present it is, as I have indicated, that the individuals as office bearers of the club would be responsible on behalf of the club<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me to expand in the context of the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0825">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1415</span>
on the defence available to someone charged with breach of clause 69, in particular the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"he did all that he reasonably could to prevent such carriage."</p></blockquote>
Clearly in a situation where the hirer was simply standing outside the bus and saw alcohol being carried onto it, he might be entitled to say that he did not consent or connive, but he certainly would not have done all that he reasonably could to prevent it if he did not intervene and made no attempt to prevent it.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, he was at home in bed or watching television when the event took place, it could presumably be argued by him with a fair degree of conviction that there was no reasonable way in which he could have prevented the act, given that he did not know it was happening at the time in question.<br><br>
Obviously we shall discuss this matter in detail when we come to the clause concerned but, using this example, it seems imperative that if a person is present when the requirements of the law are being flouted in respect of a coach of which he is the hirer and there is a reasonable way for him to prevent the occurrence but he chooses not to take it, he must surely, and ought to be required to, accept the responsibility, at least in part, for what takes place.<br><br>
I do not see how, on the basis of ordinary common fairness or common sense in the sort of situation that I have envisaged, one could avoid that conclusion. That is why we view this provision as appropriate. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to divide the Committee on the matter. I take his point and we shall be able to discuss the nature of the defence more appropriately when we reach clause 69.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely convinced. In view of what the Minister said, clause 69 may take us a few minutes to debate. I take the view that someone who is in court for a criminal offence which attracts criminal penalties should have a direct involvement in that offence. I do not like what one might call crimes by default— negative crimes, sins of omission rather than commission. However, I certainly do not want to divide the Committee on this clause. We shall watch what happens. I hope that the specific offences under Part V
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1416</span>
will be recorded individually, that it will be possible to ascertain, if not by reference to a specific section in the criminal statistics, at least by application to the Ministry, how many prosecutions take place under these various categories, so that we can properly monitor and keep an eye on what is happening.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 328, in page 47, line 12, leave out from "£200" to end of line 15.<br><br>
Basically, the amendment seeks to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>). We see no need for the provision That
<br><blockquote><p>"any person who is drunk on the vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50."</p></blockquote>
Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are fairly draconian in their own right, and certainly paragraph (<i>a</i>) takes care of the individual who may be
<br><blockquote><p>"in possession of alcohol on the vehicle shall be guilty of an offence"</p></blockquote>
and so on.<br><br>
We have just discussed paragraph (<i>b</i>), and we are not entirely happy with the Minister's response. At a time when we are seeking to modernise our criminal law by moving towards decriminalisation of the offence of being drunk and incapable I find it difficult to understand why, in looking for a new approach to control football crowd hooliganism or supporting crowd hooliganism, we are introducing that offence into clause 67.<br><br>
I think that it was Burns who once said that a man can drink and not be drunk.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General for Scotland says "Hear, hear". There is always a great difficulty in determining when a man is drunk and when he is not. I have seen many people who appeared to be absolutely rolling drunk but who were stone-cold sober. I have seen many people whom I thought were stone-cold sober and who were absolutely rolling drunk. There is difficulty in deciding. I do not think that there is any need for the provision and I hope that the Minister will

meet us and agree that this part should be deleted from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The Opposition's objection to the clause lies in the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"any person who is drunk on the vehicle".</p></blockquote>
As far as I am aware, there is no offence at present in Scottish law of drunkenness; there is drunk and incapable, drunk and disorderly, drunk in a shebeen and drunk in charge of a child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Drunk as a judge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be. But there is no legal offence of being drunk. In other words, the clause seeks to introduce not only the offence of being drunk on a vehicle; it introduces a new offence if drunkenness itself. That would be a new definition in law.<br><br>
I agree that I cannot compete with the legal eagles on the Government Benches in my knowledge of the law but, as far as I am aware, that is the case. Therefore, it seems that the definition should be taken out or that extra words such as "drunk and disorderly" or "drunk and incapable" should be inserted. But if there were done, there would be no need for the clause, because the offence would be already covered by law. Like my hon Friend, I am concerned about the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I first point out that there is a similar requirement under clause 72— any person who was drunk at a designated football ground would also be guilty of an offence. Hon Gentlemen would accept that it is logical that one should cover both situations. I accept that Opposition Members may also be opposed to clause 71, too, but if it is thought right to be an offence to be drunk at a football ground, equally the legislation should cover the situation envisaged in this clause.<br><br>
Reference has been made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to the fact that, in his view, this is the first time that the word "drunk" has appeared by itself. I have to tell him that he is wrong. The Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 uses the term in the same way. Therefore there is no absence of precedent on this.<br><br>
There is also a practical situation that hon. Gentlemen may wish to take into account. We are doing all in our power to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1418</span>
discourage the carriage of alcohol on coaches. A situation could easily arise where a person surreptitiously brings alcohol on to a coach and in the course of consuming it the coach is stopped by the police because of what appears to be going on within it. The can or the bottle may be thrown out of the window or concealed in some other way so that it cannot be discovered. If we remove this provision, the presence of a drunken individual on the bus could not in itself give sufficient grounds for a prosecution. Although the container may not be discovered, it seems in the public interest that if a person is drunk on a coach that should be covered by the clause.<br><br>
Obviously the whole purpose of the provisions is to prevent drunkenness at the football ground because of the trouble associated with that. Either the coach is going to the football ground, in which case it is appropriate that drunkenness on the coach is as deplorable as and to be prohibited as much as drunkenness at the ground itself; or the coach is coming from the football ground, which would imply, as these coaches normally leave immediately after the end of the game, that the individual concerned had been drunk during the match itself, presumably by surreptitious consumption of alcohol.<br><br>
Therefore, in each of the circumstances in which this provision could apply the normal and appropriate criteria would have existed. Therefore, it would seem totally illogical and inconsequential to ban the carriage of alcohol on coaches and the consumption of alcohol at football grounds, but to allow drunks, without prosecution, to be present on those coaches. It would also make the problems of enforcement that much greater, for the reasons that I have indicated.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept that it would not be appropriate to remove this provision. I emphasise that the maximum fine is £50 with no alternative of imprisonment, which, relatively speaking, it is a modest fine. But it seems right that some provision should be made, as otherwise the problems of enforcement, which I concede are already difficult, will become far more so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has linked the clause closely to paragraph (<i>a</i>)—the carriage of alcohol: he wants an extra way of preventing it. Why has he not linked (<i>c</i>) with (<i>b</i>)—in other words, made it an

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1419</span>
offence for the person organising the outing to make sure that drunks do not get on the coach as well as ensuring that they do not carry alcohol?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise on a point of clarification. As one of those in the world who have to suffer individuals who I consider to be drunk, but they may not consider themselves to be drunk, I am uncertain how we define a drunk. My view might not be tolerated by many others. I often find individuals who consider themselves to be perfectly sober who in my view are decidely drunk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recal a song in his part of the world that goes:
<br><blockquote><p>"I can drink and no' be drunk</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>And I can fecht and no' be slain,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>And I can lie wi' anither man's lass</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>And aye be welcome tae my ain."</p></blockquote>
That might be relevant; it might not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to follow the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), but may I add a specific point to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) as to why an obligation should not be imposed on the hirer where a drunken person is carried?<br><br>
The McElhone working group recommended that the operator of the vehicle should be so responsible and should be held to have committed an offence if a drunken person is carried on his vehicle. On reflection, the Government thought that that was not appropriate and that it was better that the responsibility for being drunk should fall entirely on the individual who is drunk. As the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) recognises, that is a not unfair approach to these matters. For that reason the provision is as proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The bus organiser or operator, instead of allowing the carriage of alcohol, which he would not be allowed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1420</span>
to do and could be fined for, might arrange for the bus to stop at 15 different pubs on the way to the ground, at which every member of the party will get drunk, and he will be in no way responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But all those who consume alcohol would be responsible, and that is very appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of this alcoholic haze, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
