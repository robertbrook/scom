<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 4, line 9, after
<br><blockquote><p>"broken", insert "or".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 23, in page 4, line 10, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"or is likely to break".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is to clause 3(7), which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A constable may arrest without warrant an accused who has been released on bail where the constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the accused has broken, is breaking, or is likely to break any condition imposed on his bail".</p></blockquote>
While I recognise that it is desirable and necessary that the police should be given powers to arrest without warrant where someone is on bail on conditions, I consider that the circumstances in which a police officer would be empowered to make an arrest without warrant are, in the terms of subsection (7), too wide. "Has broken" causes no problems; "is breaking" causes no problems; but the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"is likely to break any condition".</p></blockquote>
seems to be a very wide provision indeed. I have some doubt whether it is really necessary to extend police powers in this wide fashion.<br><br>
When my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland was dealing with this matter, which had been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), he rejected the complaint by reference to the example of a fraudster on the steps of Concorde heading off to the sun. The Solicitor-General for Scotland said that in those circumstances it would be desirable for a police officer to be able to arrest such a man. Of course I accept that, but my argument is that if the police were to be given the power to arrest simply where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a man has broken or is breaking the conditions, that power would be wide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
enough to empower the police to arrest such a person on the steps of Concorde. The man has already put his luggage on board. He has already been through passport control. Without straining the language of the subsection in any way, he is already breaking the condition imposed upon him.<br><br>
What concerns me is the very point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East turned his attention. It is the fact that the conditions that might be imposed by a sheriff are potentially of an extremely trivial nature or an extremely detailed character. If, say—this is again a type of example that the Solicitor-General for Scotland mentioned—the accused is to be prohibited by a condition from going to a public house, a football ground or, possibly, his former wife's house, at what point of proximity to the pub, house or football ground is he so close that a constable might be said to have reasonable cause for suspecting that he is likely to break the condition? Might he walk down Easter Road on a Saturday afternoon when Hibs are playing at home? That is the sort of problem that arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In what direction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tom Hart, Hib's chairman, might well be on my side. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has a point. Certainly, Hibs would not want anything that might drive away their last few remaining fans.<br><br>
More seriously, what concerns me is that this provision gives the police a wider power than I believe is strictly necessary. I appreciate that much of this Bill, with some changes, is a reflection of the equivalent English legislation, where similar provision is made for arrest without warrant when there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is likely to break any condition. From what research I have been able to carry out, I know that this provision has not caused any difficulty in England since it came into operation. But in view of the nature of these conditions—potentially of a trivial nature; there may be one of not being allowed to drive a motor car—there will be considerable difficulties. In my opinion, the Bill would be better framed if it did not allow such wide powers of police arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), an amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
ment which stands also in my name. Thanks are due, also, to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who took up the matter originally during the previous Parliament.<br><br>
In my view, the intention in the clause is one which should not be countenanced by the Committee, because it bastardises the existing criminal law. It introduces a new category of offence under the guide of observance, or maintenance of observance, of bail conditions.<br><br>
Hitherto, as far as I am aware, the three main categories of offence—there may be others, but these are the three of which I have always been aware—were criminal activity, attempted criminal activity and conspiracy to commit a crime. Here we are moving into preventive medicine with a vengeance, where anybody who is likely to evade a condition of bail is considered capable of being arrested. That is a new classification of offence. Those who are likely to commit a breach of their bail conditions may be arrested without a warrant.<br><br>
Frankly, I doubt whether it can be imposed. The police would have considerable difficulty. It would have to be deployed only on very rare occasions. Apart from the fact that so far Concorde has not parked in a Scottish airport on a regular service, the likelihood of that specious example happening is remote. Apart from anything else, in the particular offences where a person may be keen to go abroad in order to avoid trial, I should have thought that the court would have withdrawn the passport. Therefore, the person would be unlikely to get through passport control—unless resorting to the obscure methods in novelettes whereby people manage to get false passports.<br><br>
I believe, therefore, that a curious and dangerous provision has crept into the Bill. The intentions are probably sound. If we are getting rid of money bail we must be seen to be tough. These bail conditions not only have to be observed; they have to be buttressed with penalties if they are not observed. But that intention has led us into a very strange lane, where we now find that those who are likely to breach bail conditions are subject to arrest even before they have done anything.<br><br>
I agreed with the argument and reasoning of the hon. Member for South Angus when he dealt with the example of a person boarding Concorde, in that any person
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
getting into such a situation would have met the criteria established under the clause without the need for insertion of the phrase "or is likely to break", because by that time, as the hon. Gentleman illustrated, the person would have been in breach of or have broken the condition of bail which has been set.<br><br>
The example that it is proposed to import into our law is a bad one. It creates a new classification of offence, which is a dangerous example to start off with. It is a fairly minor example in itself, but we ought not to expand lightly the categories of criminal activity into the preventive nature that is contained in the subsection.<br><br>
Parliament decided many years ago to abolish preventive detention on the grounds that it was an unfair method of safeguarding the public if people could be locked up for many more years than their criminal background warranted, on the basis that by keeping them in prison for a long time they would therefore not be in a position to commit further crimes. If we follow Parliament's example of the past, we should not accept this incursion into the law of Scotland. I regard it as dangerous, and I feel that the Committee would be well advised to excise it because, in practical terms, it would not mean much to the powers contained in the statute, but it could be used as a precedent for further extension of the classification of preventive provisions against crime which seems to be emerging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister could guide the Committee on the point that if someone has jumped bail, or is in the course of doing so, presumably he can be sentenced for doing so, because he has committed an offence. Therefore, if he's likely to jump bail, has he in fact committed an offence for which he may be charged? If not, perhaps he ought not to be arrested for doing something for which he could not be charged. I should be grateful for guidance from the Government on that point, particularly in view of the example of someone boarding, or about to board, an aircraft. Presumably it could be part of the conditions of bail that a person is not allowed to board an aircraft travelling to a destination outside the jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome strongly the view from the Conservative Benches because it shows commendable signs of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0040">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
independence. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) remarked, I move this amendment in the Committee which considered the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill—as reported in c. 274 of the <i>Official Report</i> of those proceedings. At that time I was a lonely voice crying in the wilderness. I received no response from Conservative Members and even less from my own Front Bench, so I look forward with intense pleasure to the vote which I know the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) will call in a little while, when I shall support him. From what has been said, so also, I gather, will a number of Conservative Members. These Back-Bench cross-fertilisation exercises are totally commendable and good for parliamentary democracy.<br><br>
On the merits of the issue, I briefly add one other argument. When we debated this matter on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, it was clear that the hon. and learned Member who is now the Solicitor-General for Scotland was in one of his far-away-places moods. Throughout that Committee stage, we had liberal examples of the way his mind was turning to Pacific islands and the steps of Concorde, and I wondered whether we would not soon be reading in the newspapers that he had taken that way out himself, so obsessed was he with the mechanics of the procedure.<br><br>
I shall quote the hon. and learned Member, because on that occasion as sometimes happens, he hit the nail firmly on the head. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Suppose a constable saw a man at Glasgow airport about to board an aeroplane for somewhere abroad, is he entitled to think that he is breaking his bail? If there is no condition that he is not allowed to go on holiday, and if he is going abroad 10 days before his trial, is the constable allowed to arrest him on the basis that he thinks he will not turn up for his trial, whereas he is going for a week's holiday in the Bahamas?"—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th February <i>1979; 274c..</i>]</p></blockquote>
That seems to me exactly the point, and I am sorry that the logic of the hon and. learned Member's argument did not persuade him to vote for the amendment. As I understand it, he was saying that if someone is under a condition of bail that he shall not leave the country and is found on the steps of that legendary Concorde aircraft, clutching his passport and tickets, having gone through customs control, we do not need the phrase "is likely to break". What one has, in fact, is the phrasing that would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
remain in the Bill—"the accused … is breaking".<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I think that by the time one reaches the stage—though this may be a matter for argument—of having bought tickets to travel abroad, having joined the 'plane and made all the preliminary arrangements, one would be in the process of breaking the bail conditions. One may not have broken them, but one is surely in the process of breaking them. The danger is that if we include the words "is likely to break" we may be encouraging a policeman to take the view of the law that the hon. and learned Member put forward.<br><br>
That means that even where there is no condition that he shall not leave the country, but merely the general presumption, as with anyone on bail, that the person will turn up for his trial, if he is found going abroad before his trial, a policeman might take the view, as did the Solicitor-General for Scotland, that, if the person is going abroad, he may not be returning for the trial and therefore is likely to break the bail conditions and so can be arrested. Yet that person might be saying innocently, "I am going away to get a good suntan so that I am not embarrassed at the reception procedures in Barlinnie after I am convicted, but I have every intention of coming back for my trial."<br><br>
There is a danger that the logic of that intervention by the hon. and learned Gentleman in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill proceedings might, on occasion, lead a policeman to take the same view and make an arrest in such circumstances. It is a danger that we do not need to risk, because I am not convinced that the present wording of the Bill is not adequate to cover the situation where someone is boarding a 'plane, clearly intending to leave the country, when the bail condition is to the contrary.<br><br>
The then Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not see the situation arising all that often in which an accused person would be arrested under the conditions that obtain in this clause—"</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 6th February 1979;</i> c.275.]</p></blockquote>
The fact that it may not arise all too often does not seem any excuse for leaving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
the possibility of error in that way. It seems to me that the Committee should support the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), and throw out what seem, on the whole, to be unnecessary phrases which might lead to abuse on rare occasions.</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), for enabling us to have this short but useful debate. I can understand the concern of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee about the provision in the clause enabling a constable to arrest, without warrant, not only those who have committed a breach of conditions or are in the process of breaking a condition, but those who are likely to.<br><br>
The fact that that has caused concern has led the Government to insert an extra safeguard in the clause that was not present in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Under clause 3(7) a constable does not have unrestricted discretion as to how he exercises his power to arrest without warrant. Before he is able to exercise the right to arrest without warrant persons likely to be considering breaking a condition, the constable must be satisfied that he has reasonable grounds for believing that it is indeed the intent of those whom he is contemplating arresting.<br><br>
The requirement of "reasonable grounds" was not in the original Bill. When we last debated the matter, my hon. and learned Friend the present Solicitor-General for Scotland argued cogently that it would be appropriate to do as the Thomson committee originally recommended and to insert the qualification that before a constable was allowed to exercise this right, he must have reasonable grounds for believing that the action he suspected was about to happen. Then the Minister, the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), made clear that the Labour Government accepted that that would be a desirable improvement in the Bill. I presume that the hon. Member's silence this morning indicates that the Opposition now support the clause in its new form.<br><br>
The question remains whether this power is necessary, even in its restricted and controlled form. I am happy to com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
ment on the reasons why the Government feel that it is appropriate.<br><br>
The understandable concern that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have shown regarding the possible use of this power is not likely to be proved justified. The constable's power relates to a situation in which there might be a breach of condition of bail. As the constable must have reasonable grounds for believing that there will be such a breach, at the very least, he will have to demonstrate that he is aware of the conditions in the first place. We are talking about conditions of bail. In the vast majority of cases, an individual constable, walking down the street, meeting an individual member of the public, would be unlikely to be aware of the specific conditions that might have been imposed by the court on that individual. Therefore, unless the constable were aware of the conditions, he would not be able to satisfy the court that there had been reasonable grounds for believing that those conditions had been, or were likely to be, broken.<br><br>
Why is it necessary to give the constable a power to arrest without warrant if he believes that a bail condition is likely to be broken? Perhaps I may comment on the example that has been used by both sides of the Committee—the gentleman about to climb into Concorde, or some other jet airliner, and about to leave the country. My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) argued that if a person were climbing the steps of an aeroplane, it should be sufficient proof to meet the requirement that he was breaking a condition imposed upon him by the court, if, for example, the court had required him not to leave the country.<br><br>
The trouble with that argument is that it entirely depends on the specific wording of the condition that may have been laid down by the court. If the court had laid down a condition wide enough to cover the example that has been put forward, there is no doubt that the action mentioned would be held to come within the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What it comes to is this. I argued in the last sitting that the problem of conditions was how to frame them with precision. It seems to me that my hon. Friend is tacitly accepting that there is a problem about the drafting of conditions by a sheriff at the time an accused comes before him. This provision is really inserted as a long-stop to ensure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
that, if conditions are imprecise, a constable is left with some residual power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but it is not only a question whether the conditions may be imprecise. They may be extremely precise. But if my hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, they may prevent a constable stopping someone from leaving the country until that person has already taken off on board the aircraft in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Should we not also see this—to put a connotation on it that is different from the Minister's—in the context of the constable needing to have only reasonable grounds to believe that someone is in the course of jumping bail? In those circumstances, if the constable had reasonable cause for suspicion the provision would deal with the kind of conditions for which my hon. Friend is suggesting the constable would need powers in order to imagine that the person was likely to jump bail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. But let us assume, as is extremely likely, that the court has simply imposed a condition that the accused shall not leave the country. That is a perfectly precise condition—it is not vague or woolly—and one which might be considered appropriate by the court. If the amendment were accepted, the only basis on which a constable who had reasonable grounds for believing that an accused person intended to leave the country, could act, would be—let us use the exact words of clause 3(7)—
<br><blockquote><p>"where the constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the accused has broken, is breaking…any condition".</p></blockquote>
If the condition is that he shall not leave the country, the arrest cannot obviously, be made on grounds of "has broken", because, by definition, that has not yet occurred. With "Is breaking", it becomes very difficult to put a clear assessment on the situation. At what stage is a person leaving the country? Is he leaving the country when he purchases his ticket to the Bahamas or is he not leaving the country until he reaches the airport and checks in his luggage? Even when he has checked in his luggage, is he leaving the country or is he simply demonstrating an intent to leave the country? That is what the clause says in its present form.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we leave aside this mythical person who will be able to afford to leave the country and deal with the situation where the police may have unsuccessfully opposed bail, which is much more likely? If we leave these words in, we could have a situation where the police could use the clause to harass someone. Is not it more reasonable to both sides of the Committee to accept that if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has broken or is breaking any condition, we should delete these words and leave the "reasonable grounds" situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I certainly agree with him that neither the Government nor any member of the Committee would wish to encourage or allow a situation where harassment would take place. But what we are talking about is not the creation of a specific offence. The only question is whether the police would have the power to arrest without warrant. If they exercised that power, the person arrested would have to be brought before a court at the first available opportunity under the terms of clause 3(8). The court would be quite entitled to take the view, if such were the case, that there had been no reasonable grounds for arresting the accused in the first place, and to emphasise to the police its displeasure at the behaviour that had taken place. However, that would depend on the circumstances of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend again. Would the person arrested under this provision be taken to a court? He has not committed an offence of any sort and, therefore, he would not be taken to court, so there is no certainty that, having been arrested, he has any means of getting himself out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I can assure my hon. Friend on this particular point. Clause 3(8), which is the subsection after the one with which we are dealing, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An accused who is arrested under this section shall wherever practicable be brought before the court to which his application was first made not later than in the course of the first day after his arrest".</p></blockquote>
Clause 3(8) goes on to indicate certain specifications.<br><br>
It is the intention of clause 3(8) that a person arrested under it shall be brought to court in order that the court may consider whether any changes in the relevant bail conditions are to be made.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With clause 3(8) we could be dealing with a situation—I believe that it is this which is much more likely to occur—of harassment by the police if they opposed bail in the first instance, rather than the case of the mythical guy boarding Concorde. Under clause 3(8) a policeman could arrest a person—if subsection (7) is left as it is—on the assumption that he has reasonable grounds for believing that that person is breaking or is likely to break the conditions of bail on, say, a Saturday morning, which would mean that the person would have to stay in gaol over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Gentleman must appreciate that the police do not have absolute discretion in this matter. There have to be reasonable grounds for taking the action which they have taken—which the court will be able to review—because the person will come before the court at the earliest practicable opportunity and the court will have to review whether the police acted in a reasonable way.<br><br>
In either this case or in other cases where individual police officers can be demonstrated to have acted in an unreasonable way, there is no question but that there is every recourse available to ensure that that sort of conduct does not continue. It is not conduct that would be approved by a chief constable, by the Government, by public opinion or, indeed, by the court. Therefore, while there may be exceptions in individual cases, that applies not simply in the terms of this provision but in terms of the general way in which the police carry out their responsibilities.<br><br>
However, I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will accept that in the vast majority of cases the police do not act in an unreasonable fashion. They have no desire to arouse individual members of the public. If that happens in isolated cases, steps can be taken to ensure that it is not repeated.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
I want to go back to the example used by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, because it illustrates the problem well. Let us assume that the amendment were accepted and that, therefore, power was restricted to arresting an accused who was in the process of breaking his condition of bail—namely, that he should not leave the country. In order to meet the problem, which hon. Members on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
both sides have recognised, the court, in making the original condition, would not simply be able to say that it was a condition of bail that an accused should not leave the country. It would have to specify something to the effect that the accused should not make any preparations to leave the country—otherwise there would be no way in which a constable could use the law, as it would then exist, to prevent an accused from disappearing and not turning up for trial.<br><br>
This is a very real problem, otherwise we are simply talking about the intent of an accused. When he has checked in his luggage, bought his ticket and is walking out to the aircraft he may be demonstrating an intent to leave the country; but he is not actually leaving the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman making heavy weather of this? At present people are released on money bail and they are quite free to make every effort to leave the country if they can. They should not do that and would be penalised for doing so by the loss of the money bail. In many cases the money bail might well be a minimal criterion. On Second Reading we argued that as a reason for getting rid of money bail. But does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the surrender of an accused's passport would be the most practical way of preventing someone from leaving the country? That is the extent to which any court can deal with the situation. The great argument we are having is redundant and we shall have a very dangerous phrase inducted into the statute which will be of no practical help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I have to disagree with the hon. Member. One reason why we are reforming the law, with the approval of both sides of the Committee, is that the existing law of bail is unsatisfactory. At present the only condition on a person who has been granted bail is that he should turn up on the day of trial. It has been agreed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—and by the previous Government as well as the present Government and, indeed, by the hon. Member himself—that it is more appropriate that specific conditions should be imposed which go far beyond the simple requirement to turn up for trial on the day itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When moving the amendment, I mentioned a matter which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
interested me. My hon. Friend may be coming to it, but perhaps I may remind him. We have here a provision that, almost verbatim, reflects the provision in the English statute. Has my hon. Friend any research or information to put before the Committee which would demonstrate whether the existence of this provision in the English legislation has caused any difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think, as my hon. Friend said, that his own inquiries—and I do not have any information to the contrary—indicate that the provision in English legislation has not created any of the problems that hon. Members are concerned would apply in Scotland. We have not reached this view about the need for this provision simply because of the experience in England, although it is certainly useful to take that into account. When both we and the previous Government inserted this provision in the legislation, it was to take into account the specific recommendation of Lord Thomson's committee. The Thomson report specifically recommended that this provision be introduced, although it added the rider that before a constable</span></p>

<p>exercised this power he should have reasonable grounds for believing that an accused was likely to break a condition.</p>
<p>It was because the previous Bill did not include that qualification and that element of extra control that we pressed upon the then Government to include the words "reasonable grounds" in the clause, and that has now been agreed on both sides of the Committee.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I hope that hon. Members will accept, first, that the police will not have undue or uncontrolled discretion in the matter and that there will be strict controls as to the exercise of this power; and secondly, that the change that has now been put into the clause, compared with the original Bill, should reassure my hon. Friend that the experience in Scotland will be similar to that south of the Border and that this will be a helpful improvement in the law and one to which hon. Members can give their full support.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 8.</p>
<p>to move amendment No. 26, in page 4, line 40, leave out subsection (1).</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Government amendments Nos. 27 and 31.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These three amendments remove a gap in the Bill. Clause 4(1), as drafted, reproduces the existing provision for withdrawal of caution. That was satisfactory when the sole object of bail was to secure the accused's attendance at court. If the accused appeared personally at court, the object was achieved, and if he could not put up bail himself or find another cautioner he would be held in custody. But that appears to have left a gap in the present Bill.<br><br>
The problem arises in a case where a cautioner deposits a bond of caution and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
the accused breaches one of the conditions of bail other than that of failing to appear at a specified time, and if there is a diet of a court in relation to the original offence which preceded the appearance in relation to the breach of conditions, the cautioner would be able to recover his money while the accused person was still, in fact, on release under conditions. Therefore, the deposit would be ineffective.<br><br>
The amendments fill a gap in the Bill. It is not likely to happen, but, lest it should, the Government feel it proper to ensure that it cannot.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 27, in page 5, line 3, leave out "the said section 1(3)" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"section 1(3) of this Act".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—[<i>The Solicitor-General for Scotland.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 5, line 9, after "may", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"on the application of the accused or a cautioner".</p></blockquote>
This is one of three amendments which may be taken at a fast gallop because it is merely for clarification. With amendment No. 28, the clause would read:<br><br>
"Provided that the court, if it is satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so, may" on the application of the accused, or a cautioner, reconsider the forfeiture order.<br><br>
The reason is quite simply that money bail will be involved only in very substantial cases—or at least, that is the intention—where it follows that the sum deposited will be large. I am thinking in the realms of big company frauds where we might be talking of £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 bail money being deposited. As I understand it from a quick reading of the clause, the suggestion is that the bail money may be forfeited, but at a subsequent date the court, if satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so, may recall that order.<br><br>
That would be on the motion of someone—no doubt the accused person—but I wanted it put in to make clear that it should be possible for the unfortunate person who has put up a substantial sum of money to ask the court to review the circumstances if he thinks that there are special arguments for allowing such a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
review. It was done merely to clarify that the review of the forfeiture order could be made at the behest of the person at risk—that is, the person putting up the bail—as well as of the accused. It may be unnecessary and it may be that the right exists, but to my mind it was not clear from my reading of this part of the Bill, and I should be grateful for the comments of the Solicitor-General for Scotland.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to reassure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that, as the clause is presently drafted, anybody can apply for a recall of the order. Indeed, the procurator fiscal may consider it appropriate in the circumstances and he may apply. I assume that the hon. Member's anxieties and the ferocity of his opposition to money bail arise from the fact that he expects commonly to be in the position of the cautioner. But let me assure him that if his amendment were approved it might cause substantial difficulties because the provision would be restricted to the cautioner or the accused.<br><br>
If, for instance, the accused were unfortunately killed on the way to the court and the cautioner were not there, the order could not be recalled. It is important that it be left to the complete discretion of the court so that on its own initiative, or that of anyone else, the order can be recalled at any time or varied at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wished only to obtain that assurance and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 5, line 10, after first
<br><blockquote><p>"the ", insert "forfeiture".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 30, in page 5, line 10,
<br><blockquote><p>leave out "bail".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the amendments are, of great importance, but I think they are worth considering. I appear, to some extent, in the role of a pedant in this case.<br><br>
Amendment No. 30 refers to bail money. I think that the term "bail money" is slightly misleading. It is a term we are, in effect, abolishing, and to import it into this clause could lead to someone who was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
reading the clause for the first time being under a misapprehension. The word "bail" does not add anything to the sense of the clause and I suggest it would be better if it were removed.<br><br>
Amendment No. 29 seeks to insert the word "forfeiture". Again, I think it would make the clause a little clearer. When Ifirst read the clause, I was not clear what the word "order" on page 5, line 10, referred to—whether it was the granting of bail with conditions, an order under clause 3 for a deposit of caution, or the forfeiture order in clause 4(2)(<i>a</i>). The inclusion of the word "forfeiture" would make it clear that the order is the one forfeiture the bail or the caution, and therefore would make the clause less ambiguous. Those who are as slow as I would not have to spend three or four minutes trying to decide to what order the clause referred.<br><br>
I think it better that the word "forfeiture" is included, and I feel quite strongly about the exclusion of the word "bail", for purposes of clarity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If amendment No. 29, is read in context, only someone looking for tank traps could possibly read the word "order" as meaning anything except what is stated three lines earlier "immediately order forfeiture", provided he could recall that order. I assure the hon. Member that there is no necessity for amendment No. 29.<br><br>
However, I am impressed by the hon. Gentleman's argument on the question of bail money. The concept of the word "bail" meaning the deposit of money is something we are abolishing. In order to ensure that these two are separated and that the deposit of money is one of the conditions of release, I approve the concept that the word "bail" should be removed, if for no other reason than that I detest using nouns as adjectives. It also shortens the statutes, if only briefly. Therefore I would accept amendment No. 30, but I do not think amendment No. 29 is necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 34, in page 6, line 4, leave out '24 hours' and insert' three days'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment will come as no surprise to the Government. It gives Ministers a chance to explain the Government's present position. A similar amendment was moved to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill by the now Solicitor-General for Scotland. He did not press it to a vote, but he adduced some substantial arguments, which I supported at the time, in terms of practical difficulties.<br><br>
The matter relates to an appeal against the refusal of bail, which has to be done within 24 hours by note of appeal to the High Court. The Solicitor-General for Scotland, then on the Opposition Front Bench, tabled an amendment to change it to three days. I supported that proposal on the ground that a physical act had to be carried out—in other words, a note of appeal had to be presented to the High Court. If a man was remanded in custody and had to instruct his solicitor to draw up a note of appeal and get it lodged in the High Court all within 24 hours, that was an unreasonable restriction which might lead to the loss of a right of appeal, perhaps through difficulties of communication, travel and the thousand problems which might arise.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman argued—in my view, quite rightly—that there was no harm in making the requirement three
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
days. Of course, it should not be an unreasonably lengthy period, because the person is likely to be in custody for only three weeks for there is a maximum of three weeks. But three days out of three weeks still seems to be to be a short time, and I commend to the hon. and learned Gentleman his own arguments.<br><br>
On the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, the hon. and learned Gentleman was quite clear about the matter. He was, if I may say so, in one of his courtly old-world moods. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"With great respect, if that is what it means I would ask the Lord Advocate to look at it carefully to see if that is a reasonable restriction of time".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 6th February 1979;</i> c.283.]</p></blockquote>
I have no doubt that the hon. and learned Gentleman himself looked carefully at the matter to see why it is necessary to have such a short period. Unless he has very good reasons, I am sure that he will want to commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we are now facing the coin backwards in this respect. I am impressed by my own arguments on that occasion. I am equally impressed by the fact that I withdrew the amendment. Surely, as a practising solicitor of distinction and long standing, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) must know by now that advocates never use the phraseology " with great respect" unless they know that they have a rotten argument—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but today I shall not use the words "with great respect".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though the hon. learned Gentleman has a rotten argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two competing aspects. One is that it is important that if there is an appeal it should be heard with dispatch. If the appeal is to be successful, the longer it is delayed the more it defeats the purpose of the appeal. I dare say that when we come to clause 10 we shall hear arguments from the hon. Member for Garscadden that three days is an eternity. It is important that we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
remember that three days is three times as long as one day. It is unfortunate that Glasgow solicitors will have to get out of their beds to attend to their clients, but in the interests of the client, 24 hours is better than three days, and it is the clients with whom we are concerned. There are no practical difficulties that anybody has raised on inquiry and, therefore, despite the fact that it would give a more languid time to the solicitor who is not appealing, it gives three times as long for the unfortunate person who is appealing. Therefore, I think it important that the matter should be dealt with expeditiously, and that is why 24 hours is preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arguments of the Solicitor-General for Scotland are perfectly in order if the accused person who is appealing against bail conditions is legally represented. But what might be the case of somebody who does not know of the right of appeal, who is not legally represented? In those circumstances, the court may have to be advised to notify such a person that there is a right of appeal. Would it not be preferable that a longer time might be made available to such a person, in order that he may know how he stands in relation to the law, and to get advice from Barlinnie or through other channels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why that uninformed person would be likely to divine the law within three days if he does not divine it within 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But does the hon. and learned Gentleman not accept that if somebody is remanded in custody there are channels within the prison system that would informally inform him of the situation? It may be that there are channels within the prison system to let him know formally that he may have some rights of appeal in relation to the remand order that has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the prison authorities normally inform people of their various rights. But, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), will appreciate, 24 hours is the period allowed under section 446 of the 1975 Act for a not entirely dissimilar situation, where a convicted person who is appealing against conviction has applied for interim liberation appeals against refusal or against any conditions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
imposed. There is no objection to that. It creates no difficulties and nobody has ever complained that the period was too short. This is an absolutely parallel situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy about the reply of the Solicitor-General for Scotland, which was full of specious arguments and, of course, presented, as always, with panache. I do not think that his arguments hold a great deal of water. The key to this is on one of the few occasions on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill when he called in aid a solicitor. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall not press my amendment, but as a matter of practicality I ask the Government to look at it again.".</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am not a practising solicitor. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is. I do think that 24 hours, when one has been remanded in custody and one's property taken away".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 6th February 1979,</i> c.282.]</p></blockquote>
and so on. The general point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman was that he could foresee practical difficulties. He referred to the experience of solicitors. Let me tell him that in my view there could be practical difficulties which he may not be aware of, as he has not practised as a solicitor in Glasgow sheriff court.<br><br>
For example, if a solicitor for a custody who has been arrested is appealing in Glasgow sheriff court, he may, with difficulty, be able to see the accused before appearing for him by fighting his way to the cells. The chances of seeing him immediately afterwards are almost nil because of the cattle-truck arrangements which we operate in Ingram Street for custody cases. If bail is refused, the accused will be hustled away to the cells and by the time the solicitor arrives—he may have had to wait for another case, which, if one is a duty solicitor, one has to do—his client will have been hustled off to Barlinnie. He may be taken out of the dock protesting that he wants to see his solicitor in order to mark an appeal, but he will be taken off to Barlinnie. He will then have to pass a message to his solicitor or write to him to call on him.<br><br>
With the best will in the world, and without my throwing any aspersions on the efficiency of the Post Office, it will be one or two days before the solicitor gets that letter and he then will, no doubt—saving got out of his bed early, as most
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
solicitors do, it may surprise the hon. and learned Gentleman to know—have to hurry out to Barlinnie to take instructions. By that time 24 hours looks very inadequate but three days looks perfectly adequate. When we look at that situation, it seems that there are very substantial practical difficulties.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I cannot see any harm to the legal system to say that there should be three days in which to mark this appeal. It is quite dishonest to suggest that this is an amendment for the benefit of solicitors. Of course, the person who wishes to appeal against the refusal of bail would no doubt like it to be marked within 24 hours: there is no reason why, in many cases, that cannot be. But it is no consolation to tell the accused that if he cannot contact his solicitor for two days he has lost his right of appeal and that this was a splendid wheeze by the Conservative Government to concentrate the minds of solicitors who are early risers from bed. That would be absolutely no consolation.<br><br>
I am not in a mood to withdraw the amendment, and I think that we should press it to a Division. I cannot see how anyone would be prejudiced. We may save a right of appeal which could easily be lost because of the unsatisfactory state of the court system, which I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman is struggling hard to ameliorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing that this crowd of anxious and diligent solicitors, frustrated by their colleagues on the sweaty staircase of the Glasgow sheriff court, do not have any difficulties under section 446 of the 1975 Act, which is identical.<br><br>
This is only an appeal against a refusal of bail when the court adjourns the case for sentence to make inquiries in the meantime. That is what it is about—nothing else. In our opinion, 24 hours is absolutely sufficient. It has caused no difficulty with section 446, and I see no reason why it should cause any difficulty with this clause.</span></p>

INTERIM LIBERATION BY OFFICER IN CHARGE OF POLICE STATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to clear up a point that we debated on Second Reading in relation to Clause 8. I am sorry if I delay the Committee, but the point is not unimportant. During discussion of clause 8 on Second Reading, there were exchanges between the Solicitor-General for Scotland and myself and subsequently between the Solicitor-General and my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), when the Solicitor-General said:<br><br>
"I do not know that it is reasonably reassuring, but I repeat that I will consider the matter."<br><br>
The matter to which he referred was the guidance or instructions that he intended to issue to procurators fiscal. That is not the matter that I want to raise. My point about the next sentence.
<br><blockquote><p>"While I am on this subject, I believe I should inform the Committee that instructions will also be issued to chief constables giving them guidelines as to the circumstances in which they should release, or consider release".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee, 26th June 1979;</i> c.39.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Gentleman was then stopped in his tracks. I intervened to ask from where the Government derived their power to give chief constables instructions about the circumstances under which they should release accused persons. He called in aid the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. He quoted from section 9 of that Act. Section 9 reads as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Advocate may from time to time issue instructions to a chief constable with regard to the reporting,"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
I emphasise that word—
<br><blockquote><p>"for consideration of the question of prosecution, of offences alleged to have been committed within the area of such chief constable, and it shall be the duty of a chief constable to whom any such instruction is issued to secure compliance therewith.".</p></blockquote>
To a certain extent the Solicitor-General chastised my right hon. Friend for not having understood the matter. He gave the Committee the clear impression that it was under section 9 that he was giving instructions—subsequently, he amended the word "instructions" to "guidance"—to chief constables about the circumstances or conditions under which they could release an accused person. But my understanding of section 9 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 is that it refers to the reporting procedures.<br><br>
I could easily be corrected, but I would think that the reporting procedures were the procedures the police had to adopt—under the instructions of the Lord Advocate, who is responsible for the procurator fiscal service—in reporting such alleged offences for consideration of prosecution by procurators fiscal. I think that that is as far as section 9 extends.<br><br>
I am anxious to clear up the difference of opinion expressed on Second Reading about what is intended under clause 8 of the Bill, against the background of the remarks of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I know what is intended under clause 8, but I am anxious to clear up the misunderstanding that developed between us on Second Reading, and I would be grateful if the Solicitor-General for Scotland would make clear to the Committee what his intentions are and what instructions, if any, he intends to issue to the police and to what these instructions relate. Do they relate to the reporting procedures or to the criteria that would be adopted for consideration of the liberation of an accused person? I would be very grateful if the Solicitor-General for Scotland is able to clear up this misunderstanding.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) because I wish to clear up this matter. I had intended to do so in the debate on amendment No. 46, to clause 10, but I believe it is convenient to do so now since the hon. Gentleman has raised the matter, which is one of concern.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly reminded the Committee, I drew attention to section 9 of the 1975 Act and, indeed, to section 293 of that Act—the two sections are almost identical—which gives power to the Lord Advocate to issue instructions to a chief constable with regard to the reporting for consideration of the question of prosecution of offences alleged to have been committed within the area of such a chief constable. Reporting includes which cases are to be reported, which circumstances or conditions are to govern the submission of reports and has for many years also been accepted to include whether custody—or, as at present, bail—should be asked for, or, alternatively, whether the person should be liberated without bail, or what attitude to liberation or release should be taken at the time of reporting.<br><br>
Those instructions have been issued for many years and it is the habit, for instance, in certain circumstances, for a police officer to have to ask the duty fiscal if it happens—as we shall be dealing with later—to be a weekend custody, whether the person should be held in custody or be released.<br><br>
It is in those circumstances that the Lord Advocate will revise the instructions which are presently standing as to the circumstances in which persons who are arrested are released on bail, detained in custody or released without bail.<br><br>
Perhaps it will help the Committee if I give examples, of the sorts of cases that, the instructions, which will be drawn up, will indicate. For instance, an accused who has been arrested without warrant may be released, except in serious cases, provided that the police are satisfied that the case does not come within any specified exception—that is to say, an exception specified within the instructions. In other words, there is an instruction to release, except in serious cases, except, for instance, where there is a likelihood of the accused committing similar or other offences; where inquiries have not been completed and his release might impede the continuing inquiries; where the accused has no perman-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
ent address; where the accused has a history of absconding; where the accused is likely to interfere with witnesses or has a history or a conviction for having done so on previous occasions; where he appears to be unable to understand the terms of the undertaking which he is required to give—for example, if he were drunk or under the influence of drink, appeared to be mentally retarded or something of that nature—or in any case where his release would tend to be contrary to the interests of justice.<br><br>
Those are the sort of exceptions which will be in the instructions. Clearly, one cannot give absolute definitive rules because that is just not possible; but if there is the slightest doubt in the mind of any officer as to whether the case falls within those exceptions, he has a standard instruction to apply to the procurator fiscal for instructions as to whether the person should be detained in custody or released and as to the conditions of that release. That has been the standing practice for a long time.<br><br>
The differing conditions in the Bill will require the revision of the instructions issued under section 9, but those instructions will be issued. Hitherto, they have been extremely faithfully obeyed in the spirit in which they are framed. I hope that is helpful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth and that it relieves any anxieties that the Committee may have had about the diligent control which the Lord Advocate's Department keeps to ensure that persons who should not be kept in custody are released.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for that explanation, which clears matters to some extent although a grey area of doubt remains. It clears to a great extent the midunderstandings which arose on Second Reading.</span></p>

SITTINGS OF SHERIFF AND DISTRICT COURTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 9, line 9, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"Saturday or".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
The effect of the amendment would be to alter the subsection to read that a sheriff court or a district court
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) shall not be required to sit on any … Sunday or on a day which by viture of subsection (2) or (3) below is a court holiday."</p></blockquote>
It would rebut the present intention of the Government that Saturday courts should become exceptional.<br><br>
I am totally puzzled about the technical position. Perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland can, by interruption, clear up this matter for me. As I understand it from various references made in previous debates, there is a difficulty in that there is at present a legal duty to hold courts on a Saturday, and it is to remove that duty that this clause has been inserted. Reference is made in the clause to Saturday and Sunday. If there is a legal duty to hold courts on Saturday which must be removed or there would be a breach of the law in not holding Saturday courts, what I cannot understand is why that does not apply to Sunday. Perhaps it does. There is a legal duty to hold courts on Sunday, but as far as I know no courts are held on Sunday, so I am not clear as to why this wording is needed. I should have thought that if Saturday and Sunday courts, in terms of the legal necessity to hold them, are on the same basis, because we never hold courts on Sunday we could leave the clause as at present worded and, where necessary, not hold Saturday courts if the practical difficulties become overwhelming. I am genuinely puzzled as to why we need this clause at all. However, the Solicitor-General for Scotland will no doubt clarify this for me.<br><br>
I do not want to labour the point about the merits of amendment No. 46, because we are all familiar with the arguments. It is, of course, a balance of convenience, and I do not suppose that the present Administration particularly wish to abolish Saturday courts. If I were making political points, I might suggest that it was their vendetta against public expenditure, and say that they positively wished to abolish Saturday courts in order to save taxpayers' pennies even if it prejudiced the rights of individuals. But that might be pushing the boat out too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just a wee bit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I am glad to hear the Under-secretary say, just a wee bit. But it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
still leaves plenty of room for wickedness if it is pushing the boat out only a little bit. I suspect that the paranoia about public expenditure has made it easier for the Conservatives to embrace what was—I hasten to concede—a provision of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill produced by the then Labout Administration.<br><br>
As I understand it, the real argument is one of expendiency. It is said that it is increasingly difficult to get the staff of the sheriff courts—I was originally told that it was fiscals but I now understand that it has been broadened to include sheriff clerks and other people—to work on Saturdays. Because of that difficulty and because of continuing staff opposition, it has been decided that Saturday courts be abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman right in saying that Saturday courts will be abolished? Saturday courts will not be required to be held, but there is no provision that they cannot be held.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point because the hon. Member makes if fairly. But if he looks at the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, he will see that about £40,000 is to be saved by the abolition of mandatory Scots Saturday courts.<br><br>
I hasten to say that the Saturday court will become an exception and that probably there will be a Saturday court only if there is some particularly difficult public disturbance, such as a mass demonstration or a massive number of football hooligans, where a special decision is taken to break the normal pattern of court sittings by holding a Saturday court. I do not think that I am unfair in representing the case in the way I have. It is clear that the standard Saturday court will be a memory because of opposition from the white collar staff in the sheriff clerk's department and from the fiscal.<br><br>
I am delighted to hear that the Solicitor-General will be replying to the debate, but seems to me that such an argument comes extraordinarily strangely from the hon. and learned Gentleman's lips. In the last Parliament the hon. and learned Gentleman distinguished himself with some extraordinary attacks on sheriff court staff at the time of the strike. His remarks are always highly coloured, but they were almost technicoloured on that occasion. Those concerned were compared to highwaymen and thugs if I remember rightly. All sorts of other helpful phrases in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
context of industrial dispute were coming out with machinegun staccato rapidity from the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
But the hon. and learned Gentleman was enunciating what I suppose was a respectable philosophy, that if one takes on employment in the sheriff court's department one takes on with it a number of desirable benefits such as security of employment, good fringe benefits, long holidays and so on—not, as the Committee will remember, a good salary, at that time, at least. There were all sorts of benefits. But one also takes on responsibilities. The hon. and learned Gentleman waxed eloquent on that. He said that people who became sheriff clerks were servants of the court, that they were holding up the administration of justice, and that they had a duty to do through thick and through thin.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with that view, although I always thought that it was overstated, that the hon. and learned Gentleman's flamboyance ran away with him and that it was an unhelpful contribution at the time in the context of the industrial dispute. But there is an element of truth in it, and if one accepts that argument there is clearly a duty for members of the sheriff clerk's department to say—or for it to be said to them by the hon. and learned Gentleman, who would no doubt enjoy it—that they have a duty to the courts, to the administration of justice and to society as a whole, and that if they come into the sheriff clerk's department knowing that Saturday courts are part of the rota of the administration of justice, they must live with that and be prepared to stick by it. What we are doing here on an argument of expediency is clearly and definitely eroding civil liberties, so his argument comes extraordinarily badly from the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) and perhaps other members of the Committee have experience of negotiating terms and conditions for staff analogous, at least, to those in the sheriff clerk's department. We are all aware that we may have to give compensation for the inconvenience of turning up on Saturdays. But, without wanting to sound po-faced, I point out that there are many here, including advocates and solicitors, who have worked regularly on Saturday mornings. I have turned up on countless Saturday mornings as a duty solicitor in a number of sheriff courts and have never thought of com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
plaining.<br><br>
It might be said by the cynical that being a duty solicitor is part of my business and there is a certain follow-through in terms of the trials that I might get from my duty week. But it was also because I genuinely recognise that there is a duty to turn up on Saturday to try to minimise the inconvenience and the trauma for people who have as yet been convicted of no crime, and may never be convicted of crime, and who would otherwise be held in prison until Monday, perhaps for no good cause. It is little skin off the nose of a solicitor because if the person is to be held in custody one of the profession will get the accused on the Monday anyway, so it is not a matter of turning up eagerly on the Saturday for work that one would not otherwise get.<br><br>
I believe that the Government may have to pay to persuade staff to turn up on a Saturday. The Government may have to give compensating time off. There may have to be much discussion around negotiating tables. But I do not believe that it is right to say: "Well, a lot of workers now have a five-day week, so why should not the courts have a five-day week?" As the hon. and learned Gentleman has said on many occasions, the courts are special. They have a special responsibility and a special duty to society. The hon. and learned Gentleman has had an apt pupil in me. I accept that argument and now ask him to consider it very seriously in the context of what the Government intend to do.<br><br>
It is wrong that we should abolish mandatory Saturday courts as a general rule. Unfortunately, Friday is a very busy night in terms of police activity, and very many people are held on a Friday night. If Saturday courts were abolished, they would not appear in court until Monday. They would have to sit contemplating a wall—and possibly their own innocence—through Friday and Saturday nights and the long Saturday and Sunday night before they could appear and ask for the redress of bail in court on Monday.<br><br>
I do not want to sound too emotional, but anyone who has been in the trade and who has had to deal with people in these situations knows how traumatic and unpleasant they are. On a number of occasions, I have had to take members of the family of an accused—worried out of their minds and often in tears—to a police station on Saturday or Sunday to see, for the first time, someone who has been arrested and could not be released on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
next lawful day for some reason or other.<br><br>
If we abolish the Saturday courts, there will be an increasing number of people in that situation. I am not prepared to accept that encroachment on the right to appear before court and be released on the first possible occasion, which is an important civil liberty.<br><br>
Ministers will make great play with the instructions which are being given to chief constables about releasing people under clause 8 of the Bill. I accept that it is probably the intention of the Ministers—although I am not sure that it is the intention of all Conservative Backbenchers—that the number of custodies should decline. If amendment No. 46 is not agreed to, and we have to rely on that intention, I will welcome the decline in the number of custodies over the weekend.<br><br>
I give fair warning to the Solicitor-General for Scotland that I shall do my best to monitor that decline. He will remember that he was good enough to say during the Second Reading debate that that could be done by parliamentary Question. I hereby give him a promise that there will be regular Questions about numbers of weekend custodies if the amendment does not find favour with the Committee.<br><br>
I may be cynical and I hope that I shall be proved wrong, but I believe that whatever the chief constables' instructions may be, and whatever instructions may be passed down to the men in charge at the police stations, it will take a very long time to persuade the police to change the habits that have been established for many years. And at the end of the instructions to the chief constables, there is the omnibus provision that a person is not to be released if it is contrary to the interests of justice. That provision gives a police constable, an inspector in charge of a station or a sergeant the option of merely holding on to people.<br><br>
I believe that people who are picked up for gross indecency in public lavatories, minor housebreakings or minor assaults or who perhaps have got under the skin of the policeman—we are all human—and are being charged under section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 will be held over the weekend and will not therefore be able to have their liberty on Saturday, as they almost certainly would if they could appear before a court. I am not in favour of that situation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
I am not in favour of this provision being brought into the law of Scotland as a matter of administrative expediency because the court staff feel that a five-day week would be more attractive. That view may sound unsympathetic. I accept that it may not be very popular with those who work in the sheriff courts. But on balance it is important that we maintain the liberty of the individual and do not listen to arguments such as I fear will be used by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I intend to divide the Committee on this amendment. I hope I shall receive the support of my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar) on the grounds that I have some experience of representing white collar employees. I am surprised that the Thomson recommendation has been brought into this Bill. I shall not deal with the points raised on the legal aspects of it and the fact that the Monday courts would be lengthy or that the situation would create problems for the accused waiting 72 hours. I am impressed by the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden. They are irresistable and should be accepted by the Committee. But my experience is not in the law and that makes me an almost unique contributor to the proceedings of the Committee.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
I entirely agree with the point made in the paper submitted by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties to members of the Committee, that staffing problems are not insuperable. That view is supported by my experience as a trade union officer in this area. I am surprised that the court administration has reached the position where it appears to be saying that the issue is non-negotiable. I am sure that it is the administration, and not the staff, which is saying that. It has never been my experience that staff argue that something is non-negotiable. What is much more usual is for employers to say that something is non-negotiable. I suspect that that is what has happened here.<br><br>
The white collar and supporting staffs of the courts work a five-day week. But they also work on Saturdays and Sundays. Those who operate our social work departments, those who administer our hospitals, and perhaps more important in this con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
text, the police civilian staff work on a Saturday and Sunday. I am surprised that we have reached this position regarding court staff, and the attendant problems it has for the accused.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State, addressing the Scottish Grand Committee said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A five-day week is now the norm for many occupations and the Government feel—the previous Government took a similar view—that Sunday mornings are not essential for sitting of these courts.".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee, 26th June 1979;</i> c.2.]</p></blockquote>
He is making the mistake of assuming that a five-day week is Monday to Friday. Up and down the country, thousands upon thousands of good trade unionists do not take that view. A five-day week is what it says it is. I noticed that my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden made the same mistake, but he can be forgiven because he belongs to the same profession. A five-day week is not necessarily Monday to Friday, but the Conservatives are not well known for their information on industrial relations. However, that is not what we are discussing today.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary made sympathetic noises about problems faced by clerical, administrative and support staff in having to come in at 6 a.m. in order to make preparations for the court. That sympathy was well founded. It is dreadful that administrative preparation must be made on that basis. There is something wrong with that situation. I suspect it is caused by fossilised procedures. I do not know whether the Solicitor-General for Scotland is an authority on fossils, but I am sure he will tell us what the procedures are. When he has told us, the Opposition will be able to explain to him whether we think they can be changed. I am sure that they can.<br><br>
If modern management techniques were applied to the courts and the procedures examined, it would be shown that they could be streamlined like any other clerical process. We could get to a point where the staff were not required to come in so early, where the court could sit with the minimum of administrative inconvenience, and where the accused were not faced with 72 hours of imprisonment. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden when he says that the proposal is an offence to the civil liberties of individuals. I agree with the observations of the Scottish Council of Civil Liberties, and I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
believe that Saturday morning courts can be defended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much of the difficulties of the Solicitor-General for Scotland in replying to the debate are, with respect, using the advocate's famous phrase, of his own making. I am certain that the Solicitor-General for Scotland must now bitterly regret having used inflammatory language during the industrial dispute in the courts throughout Scotland which we, when in Government, were trying to deal with. During his career as Solicitor-General for Scotland, however short that may be, he will live to regret that sort of inflammatory language.<br><br>
I want to make clear my position and, therefore, that of the Opposition. When we introduced the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill during the previous Parliament, we had precisely this divison. I am anxious that it should be tried. I am not against an experiment to see whether courts not sitting on a Saturday is a workable idea.<br><br>
When all is said and done, there is a parallel in Scotland with the banks. For many years the banks closed on a Saturday, and now the trend is beginning to be reversed. Some banks, certainly in the main cities, are now considering opening on a Saturday. Some have already done so. It may be that we shall reach that decision at a later date in respect of the courts. Perhaps during the next year, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) keeps his promise to monitor the effects of weekend custody cases, we shall see that the idea of not having courts sitting on a Saturday was a bad idea.<br><br>
If that situation develops, I hope that the Government will be big enough to come back and say that they have made a mistake and that we should revert to the original position.<br><br>
I should like to make a point that is linked to clause 3(8). There is a qualifying paragraph, as I understand, which relates to the possibility of a court sitting on a Saturday or a Sunday or a holiday to deal with criminal business that the court might consider it necessary to deal with. In such a situation, all that the paragraph says is that, in that situation, if that is the court which considered the original bail application, that person can be brought before that court, provided the court is sitting.<br><br>
I make that point because there is this link between clause 10 and clause 3(8), and because we may well want to return to that matter when the Bill is considered on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
Report. It would be unfair if I did not warn the Government that we want to give the matter further consideration.<br><br>
I do not think that district courts are a problem, as there is not much evidence that district courts sit on a Saturday morning. We are really talking about sheriff courts, the only courts that give us cause for concern. On the general principle, I am agreeing that we should try to see whether the legal system can be worked properly to the advantage of the accused as well as to the system itself, without the need to sit on a Saturday.<br><br>
After a year, say, perhaps we shall all reach the conclusion that the system is not working properly. Although my hon. Friend will press his amendment and divide the Committee, I hope that that will not put off the Solicitor-General for Scotland from giving the Committee an undertaking to keep the matter under review, and saying that, if it is found that it is not working properly, we can consider the possibility of reverting to the present practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter and I believe I may deal with it briefly.<br><br>
First, I reply to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). Obviously, in that a court may sit on Saturday we have not closed the door, so to speak, against any future development, abuse or difficulty which may arise, or arise in any particular circumstance. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, there may be only the occasional one. One may have some rowdy demonstration—the STUC occurs only once a year—so these occasions may happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Solicitor-General for Scotland does not want that remark to go on the record. I am sure that he will want to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that hon. Members should be quite so sensitive or thin-skinned. This matter will not create difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that the STUC is a rowdy organisation? Should not he withdraw that remark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member can take out of anything I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
have said whatever interpretation he cares to put on it. If his cares, anxieties and paranoias about the reputation of the STUC—which I would have thought could stand on its own, whatever anybody's udgment of it may be—make him as sensitive as that, I believe that he must find a more insulated life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way briefly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just going to refer to what was said by the hon. Member for Garscadden. I am sorry not to give him an opportunity to exercise his wit after he took such a long time to exercise both his hypocrisy and his sanctimony.<br><br>
Of course, the question of Saturday sittings is linked to the fact that under the Bill we are having release on conditions. It is the intention of the Government that people who would previously have been released shall be released and, we hope, that more people than previously would have been released shall be released. We shall keep the closest watch to ensure that people are not wrongly detained if they happen to offend or be arrested on a Friday.<br><br>
Let me make this point in illustration. I do not remember the hon. Member for Garscadden resisting the last Government's statutory idealisation of May Day as a public holiday. I do not remember him saying "That is a terrible breach of civil liberties, because if May Day happens to fall on a Monday an unfortunate person who offends on the Saturday before May Day will be kept in prison for 72 hours and we have made Monday a public holiday." If his argument is at all right, it must be right about that because if a public holiday falls on Monday, since Sunday has hitherto been a <i>dies non,</i> he would suffer the same penalty as he would now suffer if he was detained on a Saturday and a Sunday at present.<br><br>
I want to say something about the <i>dies non</i> because the hon. Member for Garscadden was puzzled by the appearance of "Saturday or Sunday". Theoretically, the word "Sunday" need not appear in that it is a <i>dies non</i> in law, but if it did not appear in the provision it might confuse people by its absence, so it is put there for the avoidance of doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. and learned Gentleman explain to the Committee what happens not only on May Days but on all

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
other public holidays at present? Is not it the case that workers such as those to whom I drew attention, like the police civilian staff, provide their services on those days just as they do on other days? We were not asking anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "No". There are public holidays on which the courts do not sit, never have sat, and I imagine, never will sit. That is a statutory matter and May Day happens to be one of those public holidays.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) made the point that lots of people happen to work on Saturdays as part of their five-day week. But there is no question of the courts being open for only five days a week. The staff at present are handsomely rewarded for what they do on Saturday.<br><br>
Despite that—if I may revert to the argument of the hon. Member for Garscadden—a very large number of people who are potentially excellent recruits as secretaries, clerical staff, sheriff court staff and fiscal staff, who ask the question "Will we have to work on Saturday?" and are told "Yes", they do not say "Ah, that is negotiable", but say "Thank you very much. I am not interested in the job." That has been the experience. They do not say "Ah, we shall have to negotiate the terms"; they say "We do not wish to work on Saturdays".<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The proposal is practically impossible. I am sure that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth understands the difficulties. I trust that he will vote with the Government on this matter, because he argued the case so cogently on the previous occasion. I noticed that he had changed his mind on the matter we voted on earlier. I trust that his consistency will be a little more electric on this occasion, and that he will support the Government, because he argues for the abolition of Saturday courts with such cogency on the last occasion when we considered the matter.<br><br>
As a matter of practical difficulty, this change will not involve the invasion of anybody's civil liberties. Those who will not be released now would not have been released previously, in any event. As a matter of practice, it is not possible to run Saturday courts. As an equally practical matter, the courts can sit on Saturday, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
I have no doubt that they will sit on Saturday, if there is any risk of a substantial prejudice arising as a result of a particular incident.<br><br>
I confidently commend to the Committee the abolition of Saturday courts, which goes hand-in-hand with the imposition of release on conditions, knowing that it will not prejudice the rights of anybody, but will assist in the administration of justice. I trust that when it is monitored by the computer brain of the po-faced hon. Member for Garscadden—as he cared to call himself, with some accuracy, I thought—he will get a happy answer, and that his anxieties and all our anxieties will be allayed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great care to the arguments of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I confess—it will not surprise or disappoint him—that I found them totally unpersuasive and, at times, slightly objectionable. The hon. and learned Gentleman holds a great office of State, and I have no objection to people wearing their great honours and their great offices with a difference—indeed, sometimes wearing them lightly. That is perfectly proper and, indeed, somewhat attractive and human. But it can be taken too far. At times, the hon. and learned Gentleman seems to me to combine a pomposity and a liking for the archaic trappings of his office with a total irresponsibility in his manner of speaking for it and filling it. That is entirely regrettable.<br><br>
I say to him, in all seriousness, that the over-sensitiveness—as he considered it—for the repuation of the STUC shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) had nothing to do with trying to protect the STUC. Its reputation will, I think, stand up well to the kind of attacks made on it by the hon. and learned Gentleman. Rather, it was an anxiety for the reputation of the hon. and learned Gentleman and his office.<br><br>
There is a limit to the number of times that the hon. and learned Gentleman's friends can say, somewhat apologetically, "He's a character and he does not really mean it". At the end of the day, people expect the Solicitor-General for Scotland to mean what he says and the things he says to be defensible. We are getting to the stage where, on occasion, that is an impossible position to maintain. It is a matter that the hon. and learned Gentleman should think about.<br><br>

Now let me give the reasons why I shall continue to press the amendment. I am not impressed at all by the arguments of expediency. I listened to what my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said, and I thought there was a lot of truth in his arguments. I believe that ways will be found, where there is a will, around a lot of these practical difficulties. For example, in the sheriff court with which I am most familiar, custodies are now held at 2.15, not at 10 a.m. That is to stop staff coming in very early in order to type the complaints. They can come on duty at a normal hour, use the morning to get the documentation ready, and then the people will appear at 2.15. I think that that is a reasonable amendment of the system in the interests of efficiency. I am not satisfied that it would not be possible to preserve Saturday courts in the interests of justice by using flexible hours, flexible working weeks and other things that could be negotiated.<br><br>
My own experience in the sheriff court which I practised daily for many years was that there was a small group of people involved on a regular basis in Saturday courts. After all, the fiscals' typists did not have to turn up every Saturday, there were two typists per Saturday. I cannot remember how many typists there were, but it was probably only one Saturday in five or six on which a typist was asked to come in. There were three or four fiscals, so it was perhaps only once a month. There is a number of sheriff clerks, so again itwas</span></p>

<p>probably only once a month, and the solicitor—we must include him if we are to be humane—would probably have liked to come in every Saturday if possible, so perhaps we should not spare too many tears for him.</p>
<p>We are encroaching upon civil liberties, we are ensuring that a certain number of people—probably more than the hon. and learned Gentleman thinks—are going to be in custody over the weekend because we cannot get staff to work one Saturday morning in four in the average sheriff court. When we weigh that balance, given the views of the Solicitor-General, so flamboyantly expressed on the Floor of the House and in Committee on so many occasions, he could have taken up his traditional role and, with justice and force, have said that that was a miserable argument of expediency against the need to preserve the judicial system and a sense of fair play for people who have been convicted of no crime at the stage at which they are held in custody. I cannot be a party to withdrawing the amendment. I intend to press it to a vote, and I hope that some at least of my hon. Friends—and hon. Members opposite who have held their peace and their silence—may be tempted to give me some support and encouragement for what I believe to be a matter of fundamental importance.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>for believing that it is not in the interests of justice or not in the interests of the accused himself to grant bail and the onus shall be on the Crown to object to bail and to show good cause why it should not be granted.".—[<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read for the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This clause attempts to institute in the law of Scotland a right to bail. It may come as something of a surprise to people who have not been involved in these debates—this is an argument for the new clause—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
that this right does not already exist. To be fair to the Government, it is clear that the intention is that there should be a right to bail on the part of an accused person unless certain special circumstances are met, such as the seriousness of the crime or good grounds for thinking that the accused would interfere with witnesses or commit another offence. We are getting near the situation in which, by implication, we are saying that there is a right to bail.<br><br>
We do not at any point in the statute, as far as I know—and I am open to correction—say unequivocally "There is a right to bail—unless". It is entirely a matter for the court's discretion and there is no onus clearly stated in favour of granting bail.<br><br>
Section 26(1) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"All crimes and offences, except murder and treason, shall be bailable.".</p></blockquote>
But it goes on merely to give a right to apply for bail. It does not say that there is a right to have bail unless there are good grounds for refusing it. I have moved the new clause in order to put that right.<br><br>
I recognise that anyone who moves a new clause is in great danger of being told that it is defective in draftsmanship or that it is impossible to implement it. I can see even now that the Under-Secretary is sharpening his quill pen, as one might say, in order to score out my efforts. Being a reasonable man, I am prepared to say that if the principle of a right to bail in a new clause is accepted, I shall withdraw this new clause so that the skilled men who guide and pull the strings behind the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary can get to work and produce an acceptable solution. But I want to get the principle accepted.<br><br>
It is not a strange, outlandish and foreign principle because it exists in other parts of the United Kingdom. I know that there are people who have made researches into this Committee, who sit beyond the Conservative Benches, and who have been looking at the Bail Act 1976 in England. Section 4(1) make the plain and unequivocal statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person to whom this section applies shall be granted bail except as provided in Schedule 1 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
I think that that is rather a brave business because if I had gone on to say "Schedule 1 of our Scottish Act" I should have been told that it would have been impossible to draft all the exceptions and that it would be wicked and wrong to try. Schedule 1 of the Bail Act 1976 shows that the English
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
draftsmen have managed it in short compass. As far as I know, there have been no troubles or problems about the drafting of the exceptions which would justify the refusal of bail.<br><br>
Knowing that there are difficulties about this, I have taken a somewhat simpler course and have suggested merely that there should be a right to bail and that the only reasons for refusing it are if
<br><blockquote><p>"there are substantial grounds for believing that it is not in the interests of justice or not in the interests of the accused himself to grant bail and the onus shall be on the Crown to object to bail and to show good cause why it should not be granted.".</p></blockquote>
The importance of that is that it gives the right to bail. It does not involve us in doing what the English, admittedly, have successfully done but which we might find complicated—making a comprehensive list of the exceptions which would justify the refusal of bail. It puts the accused person much more centrally in the spirit of the amending legislation which we are now considering, which is a proposition which the Under-Secretary at least should be prepared to accept.<br><br>
As the law stands, despite the liberal speeches that might be made, despite guidance that might be given here, there and yonder, at the moment, if the fiscal makes no objection to bail, there is still no reason why <i>ex proprio motu,</i> completely off his own bat, a sheriff or a district court bailie, or whoever it may be, might decide to refuse bail. I have not got it in for these gentlemen. I am just proposing that it is possible that they might decide to refuse bail. It would be unfortunate if that occurred.<br><br>
There is no conceivable harm in encapsulating in this Bill the fact that one is entitled to bail unless there is good reason why one should not get it. That would mean that at least there would have to be an objection from the Crown and good reasons shown why bail should not be granted. It would strengthen the rights of the accused person. It would build in the kernel and the moral crux of this legislation and would do a great deal to strengthen a useful, reforming statute.<br><br>
With those brief remarks, I commend the new clause to the Committee. I hope that it will find favour. It seems particularly important in terms of the general atmosphere—the abolition of Saturday courts, and so on. It may do something to ensure that fewer people are held in

custody, which I know is a cause dear to the heart of the Under-Secretary. It may add a few to the 2,000 people whom he hopes will not be admitted to our prisons as a result of this Bill. It is harmless, it is helpful and I hope that it commends itself to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am as concerned as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to balance the interests of justice and those of the accused person. But on examining the proposed new clause, I find the wording sloppy and the thought behind it somewhat woolly.<br><br>
The new clause attempts to move away from a discretion, at present in the hands of the sheriff, to a point where the court has to listen to the Crown justifying its position in opposing bail. That could, in many cases, run into conflict with the rights of the individual accused. For example, the hon. Member for Garscadden may be aware of cases in which the Crown has not been able to complete its inquiries into the background of an accused person, his associates, the possibility of other more serious charges being brought, and so on. It would, arguably, be harmful to the accused if the fiscal were then to ventilate matters such as that in detail, conforming to the onus placed on him by the new clause, in front of the sheriff who, in a country area, may be the sheriff who in course of time would take the trial.<br><br>
There is another matter which should be borne in mind. If the onus remains on the Crown and bail is refused, when the accused comes to trial, it could be damaging to the presumption of his innocence. Does it not prima facie suggest that if bail has been refused after the Crown has discharged its onus, it is coming very close to the procedure of a preliminary inquiry in open court, which we attack south of the Border? It is better to leave the matter as one of discretion for the courts. If we have those maverick sheriffs who cause the hon. Member such distress, he knows fully well that appeal procedures are available for a matter to be brought before a High Court judge <i>in camera,</i> to be considered by him and a wrong righted.<br><br>
The new clause is commendable in spirit, but improper in practice. I urge the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend by Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). I accept the basic idea of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but in practice, he would find that there was potential for serious damage to the rights of the individual. As my hon. Friend said, if it is required—as spelt out in the clause that the hon. Membre for Garscadden now proposes—that the onus be upon the Crown to give cause why bail should not be granted, there could be grave potential risk to the accused.<br><br>
I shall give one example, and this is where the distinction comes between what occurs in a sheriff court and what occurs on appeal before a senator of the College of Justice <i>in camera</i> in Edinburgh. I was aware of a case when the police, the fiscal and the Crown office resisted the application for bail. What came up in chambers before the judge was that at the time of a sex offence—this was some years ago—the accused had said to the complainer that he was "Bible John", and had given a few details that made it possible that it was not just a matter of threat, but a matter that the police ought properly to be investigating.<br><br>
What on earth would have happened in that case in a sheriff court in Glasgow if the Fiscal had had to say "The reason why I oppose the application for bail here is that I have some information before me that requires me to ask of the police that they check further whether or not this man is indeed the so-called "Bible John". Nothing ever proceeded from that. He was never charged with any of the offences that, collectively, came under that public name. But if that had come out in court, whatever happened in the subsequent trial on the charges on which he had been brought to court, I think he would have suffered real and substantial prejudice. I entirely accept what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is after, but the practicalities of reversing the onus, or requiring the onus to be on the Crown in that way, would have the completely opposite effect to the one he intends to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to get involved in the debate, as I was supporting the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in spirit and in vote as well, but one or two issues have arisen in our discussion. First, those who have appeared at court in summary proceedings and are also in the early stages of indictment proceedings know full well
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
that their bail is opposed. It is normal for some indication of previous convictions to be given to the sheriff by the procurator fiscal as the reason on which that takes place. That is given in summary cases in open court.<br><br>
In the early stages of indictment proceedings where the accused person appears on petition, it is frequently done for the procurator fiscal to refuse to consider bail at all—it is normally taken on his motion unilaterally, so to speak—on the first appearance, on the ground that further inquiries will take place, and the sheriff does not look into the question of bail until the second appearance some three to five days or so later.<br><br>
Again, particularly at the second appearance on petition, it is customary for the Crown to lay before the court details of previous record. That, I may add, is done at the petition stage, in camera, without the presence of the public, and is only done in public when summary cases are considered at the pleading diet at that stage.<br><br>
If it is the case that an accused person would be prejudiced by that onus, it seems to me very little prejudice compared with the prejudice that might come when the sheriff, who may well be dealing with the case in two, three, four or five weeks' time, is given details of previous convictions. That information is given on the basis that the professional judge will put it out of his mind when he comes to hear a case directed on something continuous.<br><br>
I believe that the same argument would apply to a person who had the benefit of this right being given in terms of the new clause, because the sheriff would disregard the fact that the accused person had been placed in custody awaiting the hearing of the facts of the case before deciding the question of guilt or innocence.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it is turning the argument on its head to say that further prejudice will come to an accused person because we are giving him, in terms of the Bill, an additional right—that he will be entitled to bail unless the Crown can show some reason why bail should not be granted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman accept that when we talk about prejudice to a person's rights as an individual, in these circumstances, we are not just talking about his rights in any subsequent court appearance, whether the same sheriff be involved or not, but also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
about the prejudice to his rights as an individual relating to his public reputation, which was the sort of example I gave? To say that he had been a member of a proscribed political organisation or the like, if that came up, even though it played no part in the sheriff's or judge's mind subsequently, might give a public reputation with which that individual would be stuck.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that a presentation of a list of previous convictions or the like might not do the individual's reputation all that much good either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case we are dealing with the situation as it exists. I do not believe that any further difficulty would be placed in the way of an accused person. We are giving an additional right. Most accused, given the choice of remaining in prison because they were not entitled to bail as such, or of running some obscure risk of harm being done to their public reputation but being allowed out, would probably choose the latter rather than the former option.<br><br>
We must bear in mind that bail is rarely refused in summary cases and the courts know full well how crowded are the prisons. It has only been those of no fixed abode or with a huge list of previous convictions to whom bail would be refused in a summary case. On more serious cases, those which would be taken on petition, where somebody, perhaps with a reputation which was hitherto unblemished, was being brought before the court on a charge, those proceedings would be taken in camera. Therefore, there would be no question of any harm to the reputation of that person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock, I commend the spirit of the new clause put forward by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but I fear that I have to recommend to the Committee that we do not accept it. I do so partly for the very good practical objections made by, my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), but primarily on the general proposition that the new clause is, at the very best, completely unnecessary.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garscadden stated that there was a right in all cases except murder and treason for a person
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
to apply for bail, but he suggested that there was no general right to be granted bail by the courts. While he was quite correct that there is no statutory provision to that effect, nevertheless it is a settled and accepted part of our common law that there is a presumption in favour of granting bail which the courts have to observe. In other words, the general objective which the hon. Gentleman seeks by his new clause is met by the common law of Scotland as it stands. Therefore, a statutory provision of the type advocated by the hon. Gentleman is quite unnecessary.<br><br>
In putting forward his particular arguments to the Committee the hon. Gentleman used the example of the sheriff or the judge who, on unreasonable grounds and on his own initiative without any request from the prosecution, might decide to refuse bail. I make two brief points in response to that particular claim.<br><br>
First, if the sheriff or judge were to do so, then, of course, the normal appeal procedures which exist in any event would be available. But in any case the new clause does not deal with that problem, because while it puts an onus on the Crown to put forward any arguments as to why bail might be refused, it specifically says that bail will be granted "unless the court is satisfied" that it would be against the interests of justice for bail to be granted. Given the terms of the clause, there is no reason why a sheriff on his own initiative, even if there were no representations from the court, could not, nevertheless, still refuse bail if the court itself was satisfied that the interests of justice so required it to act. Therefore, I emphasise that the new clause would not change the present situation.<br><br>
There is the additional minor defect. The wording of the clause, while it refers to "the interests of justice" does not refer to the public interest. While that is often identical to the interests of justice, it is not necessarily so, which would be a legitimate ground at present—believe the hon. Gentleman would wish it to continue to be so—for refusing bail. However, do not oppose the new clause, on that point-obviously, that is only one of detail. I simply emphasise that the existing common law provision is quite satisfactory.<br><br>
I believe that the hon. Gentleman, as a practitioner of the law, will agree with me that, where we have satisfactory circumstances so far as the common law is con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
cerned, it is never appropriate to bring in any new statutory provision which will not produce any extra good but will simply supersede existing legal provisions. For that reason, I hope that the hon. Member will consider withdrawing his new clause.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a part of the common law of Scotland that any new clause that is drafted from the Opposition Back Benches has a defect, and there are several defects in the new clause. I am not entirely impressed by the arguments, particularly the Back-Bench arguments that came from the loyal advocates.<br><br>
It is important that a new clause of this kind, although not necessarily this new clause, ought to be drafted. There ought to be a right to bail in statute as there is in the Bail Act 1976 in England. I do not understand the worries that have been expressed. At present, what normally happens is that an application for bail is made by the defence, and there must always be an application by the defence solicitor or by the accused. The fiscal then usually says that inquiries are continuing or expresses his objections in a simple shorthand way. Presumably that would continue. I am not suggesting that the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"onus shall be on the Crown"</p></blockquote>
should suggest that there should be some kind of immediate extempore hearing with witnesses, or something of that nature, or a far-reaching inquiry. There would be <i>ex-parte</i> statements from both sides, as at present. But it would strengthen the rights of the accused, rather than otherwise.<br><br>
The rather unlikely occasion of the "Bible John" case could be dealt with by a bit of tact before the sheriff with no great difficulty. In many cases it would genuinely strengthen the defence because it would force a slightly more adequate explanation of the grounds of the objection, which I think would be welcome. In the summary courts I have handled a number of bail applications and they are handled there perhaps a little less satisfactorily than in the higher courts, where the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser)—who shakes his head in negation—has practised in the past. It would strengthen the defence and would help to avoid perhaps not exactly common abuses but abuses that arise.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary says that it is part of the law of Scotland that there is presump-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
tion that bail be granted. All I can say is that there are on occasions—I repeat "on occasions"—people who sit upon benches at various levels in the law of Scotland who are either not aware of that presumption or conveniently forget it.<br><br>
I mentioned at an earlier sitting a sheriff who demanded bail off his own bat in a cited case with the result that someone spent a night in Barlinnie prison. If there are only two or three such occasions in a year it seems that a new clause ought to try to obviate that and to remind by statute, as distinct from general presumption of common law, that the right to bail exists.<br><br>
I accept that there may be defects in the new clause. I still intend to press it, despite the pleas of the hon. Member, to put on record the fact that I think that this is important and I believe that it would not be beyond the ingenuity of draftsmen to cure the defects and produce a new clause which would do what I would do without offending the professional susceptibilities of the hon. Member for South Angus and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock).<br><br>
If the Under-Secretary would undertake to look at this again to see whether that could be done, I should be delighted to withdraw the new clause. Otherwise I ought at least to mark my views on this matter by calling for a last Division of the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Before we adjourn, may I thank you, on behalf of the Government, for the kind and friendly way in which you have guided our affairs through this Committee. We look forward very much to other Committees in which</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
<p>which I referred. Because I maintain that the new clause is unnecessary, unless the hon. Member is suggesting that the court should never have the discretion to refuse bail unless the Crown itself is opposing it, clearly we are not discussing merely a question of drafting defects. I have indicated to the hon. Gentleman, in terms of his new clause and in terms of the common law, that the court can refuse bail if it believes it to be against the interests of justice to allow it. If the hon. Member wishes to remove that discretion entirely, and make it purely a matter for the Crown to make the initial request—and perhaps he would not agree that that would be satisfactory—he must accept that this has nothing to do with defects.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is for the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be what the hon. Member wants but I suspect that it is not what the official Opposition want, because it has certainly never been argued by them in the past. I suspect that for that reason, unless there is some new, instance policy about which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has not yet informed the Committee, clearly what the hon. Member is saying may be his own view and that of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) but not the policy of his party.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8</p>
<p>you are in the Chair, so that your paternal kindness may keep in check the garrulous-ness of any member of the Committee.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I associate my hon. Friends with the remarks of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I compliment you on the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. It is always difficult for a Fifer to control fellow Fifers. I myself have been in that position, and I compliment you on the way you have carried out your duties.<br><br>

I also compliment the Government. In the past fortnight I have seen some athletics that I never thought possible. It is a marvellous arrangement whereby the Under-Secretary of State has dealt with all the embarrassments that the Solicitor-General for Scotland caused for himself, and the Solicitor-General for Scotland has dealt with all the embarrassments that the Under-Secretary caused for himself, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
all the embarrassments caused by Teddy Taylor were dealt with by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). Anyone who can tread that minefield can survive at least another three weeks.</span></p>
