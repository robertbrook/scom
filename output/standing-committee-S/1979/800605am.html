<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. You will have noticed that, in the intervening period between the Committee rising yesterday morning and meeting again today, the Government have tabled a series of about 53 amendments. The Under-Secretary has generously informed the Opposition that if the Committee feels that the amendments have been tabled too late for proper consideration, they can be withdrawn and tabled on Report.<br><br>
To ensure proper discussion and debate, the Opposition are happy to accept that offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The amendments to which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) refers were not tabled after the agreement had been reached. They were tabled on Tuesday, although clearly they did not appear on the Notice Paper.<br><br>
The substantive point made by the hon. Gentleman is correct. Although these amendments are overwhelmingly of a technical nature or, we believe, of a non-controversial nature, we accept that there could be problems for the Opposition in being expected to respond to them at such short notice.<br><br>
If the Opposition prefer the amendments to be withdrawn and tabled again on Report, that is acceptable to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I have listened with sympathy to what my hon. Friend said. I support his suggestion. There is, however, a difficulty, which should be raised now.<br><br>
I do not know the Government's intentions for Report. As a Back Bencher, I presume that we shall probably be thinking in terms of only two days for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 914</span>
Report. If we are to have another 50 Government amendments on this very narrow section of the Bill, I should have thought that the normal period of two days for Report of an important Bill such as this would be inadequate. I realise that the Under-Secretary cannot commit his party managers, but if he could give an indication that he accepted the case for having more than two days on Report, given the clear pressure that the amendments will cause, that would be extremely helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot really allow a discussion on that matter. It is not a matter for the Committee, but, if it will help, I will allow the Minister to make some observations. In any event, this is not a matter for debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will appreciate that the matter of the Report stage is not for me to decide or even to hint about. That is determined elsewhere.<br><br>
But I can assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who may not yet have had an opportunity to look at the amendments, that, although there are a large number, they are overwhelmingly of a highly technical nature. I do not believe that, with the exception of a few, they will give rise to any debate at all, either in this Committee or on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a new point of order, prefaced by a matter further to the point of order. The Government clearly have not totally understood the new Bill if that is the reason for this series of amendments being thrown at us. Secondly, we have adequate time in Committee—I understand there has been agreement about that—to debate the whole of the rest of part II. But I hope that the Under-Secretary will refer back to his right hon. Friend the points that have been made in connection with Report stage. It is not true that all the amendments tabled today are of minor importance. There is a crucial amendment regarding immigration rules that is now throwing something else into the Report stage melting pot.<br><br>
We now have to be concerned with the future of Scottish law in a completely non-political way. When I read the remainder of part II last night, I was staggered by the amount of material that is totally across-party.<br><br>
If this legislation is to have any standing in the eyes of Scottish people, we must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 915</span>
dispense with the lunchtime suspension, work our way through lunch and through dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point abundantly clear. What he is now suggesting is not within Standing Orders. I am trying to be helpful to the Committee. I have already ruled that we cannot discuss the question of Report stage or how the Committee will proceed. It is laid down in Standing Orders how the Committee will proceed and I, as Chairman, will see that that is what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order unless there is something absolutely fresh in the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, it is often in order either to move a sittings motion or to ask the Government to move a sittings motion. That is what I am aiming at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. Whether or not there is a sittings motion, it is in the Standing Orders that the Committee cannot sit between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is therefore completely outwith the Standing Orders of the House. May we now proceed with the Committee stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. Gourlay, by your own ruling you have underlined the point I am making. By your own ruling it is possible to start at 3.30 p.m. and to work through dinner. This matter could be adequately dealt with by that means if we could have an understanding which is apparently open to you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Can the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) explain what he means? Is he suggesting that if the Committee sat for slightly longer today it would be possible to cover some of the Government amendments that have been tabled? If that is now what he is suggesting, there is no new factor here in what he is saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 916</span>
order, Mr. Gourlay. May I give some support to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)? I think that many of us spent last night, which was a light evening in the House, looking afresh at some of the details of part II of the Bill. When we look, for example, at the 17 pages of schedules 3 and 4, it is clear that there are many points we should like to air. We are anxious to make progress, and I shall not take very long on this matter. But we would have more time, without in any way hindering the Government's programme, if we were to sit an hour earlier, beginning at the end of Question Time at 3.30 p.m., or if we continued through the dinner break, or both. Those hon. Members whose interest in the Bill was such that they could not sacrifice their dinner would be entitled to go and eat, but those of us who wished to go right through the dinner break could do that. That suggestion has been made. I think it is in order, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order to regularise the situation, I am willing to suspend the sitting for five or 10 minutes so that the two sides may discuss the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I think that there will need to be a suspension of the sitting but not for the purpose that you have just mentioned. First, I think, with respect, that that matter can be discussed throughout the morning. We have time for that without necessarily suspending the sitting. Clearly, before one o'clock, we can make our representations to you as Chairman of the Committee and put any proposal on which both sides have agreed.<br><br>
The other point of order is a request for clarification of a point made by the Minister about these amendments. I think that the Minister said that the amendments were put down before the discussions about the handling of today's business took place. I am sure that the Minister will also agree that no indication was given during those discussions that the amendments had been put down. It was only at nine o'clock yesterday morning that it was revealed that the amendments were on the Notice Paper. So there is no misunderstanding about that.<br><br>
There are 53 Government amendments. I accept that many of them merely correct words. In clause 6, the Government had 23 amendments. I have not counted the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 917</span>
number of Government amendments that we have dealt with in the first 15 clauses of the Bill, but I suspect that it is more than 100. I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate the anticipated number of further Government amendments to the Bill. We cannot come to a sensible arrangement without knowing in advance what will happen to the Bill. It is fairly obvious that the Bill is in a serious mess. There are major drafting defects.<br><br>
Finally, I suggest that an adjournment of the Committee will be necessary after these points of order have been answered, to allow you, Mr. Gourlay, to look at the selection of amendments, so that we know what we are discussing. That selection will have to be amended against the background of the Government's withdrawal of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What is being discussed is wholly irregular. I will allow the Minister to reply, but then we ought to proceed with the amendments.<br><br>
As regards the need for an adjournment in order to look at the Amendment Paper, that is completely unnecessary, because the amendments are automatically not called or not moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point put to me by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), I cannot give the specific number of Government amendments for future clauses of the Bill. We have reached agreement on the completion of part II. When there are further informal discussions on the other stages of the Bill, I will give an indication about the number of Government amendments that may yet have to be put down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We ought now to proceed. We have taken up 15 of the additional 60 minutes which we might have had this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am not anxious to delay the Committee, but I am anxious to help matters. I must say with great respect that it is very confusing to have before us a selection list on which are 53 amendments which will not be moved or not even called. Whatever happens, 53 amendments on the selection list will not be dealt with. For the sake of credibility and to help members of the Committee and the press to follow the proceedings—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 918</span>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am seized of the hon. Gentleman's point. I understand that it has been agreed that we shall go as far as schedule 3. There are, therefore, a number of amendments on the Notice Paper which are not in dispute. It will be helpful if the Minister or someone else from the Government side will pass a list of the amendments which, under the agreement, will not be moved, to the Opposition for circulation during the sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point. It is quite simple. I understand that the agreement is that any Government amendment on the Notice Paper up to the end of part II of the Bill will not be moved by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is now absolutely clear. We can now proceed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is becoming impossible to deal with the business of the Committee. I suggest that the Committee should be suspended, if only for 10 minutes, to give us the chance to delete those amendments from the Chairman's selection list, we shall then know what we are doing and where we are going. We cannot go through the Bill being told that amendments are not being moved or not being called. We cannot run the Committee as it is being run at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being unreasonable. It is simple. All the amendments are on my list of selection, and amendments tabled by the Government will not be called or moved. There can be nothing simpler than that. I regard any move to suspend the Committee as an abuse of the rules of the House, and I am, therefore not prepared to agree. We must proceed with the Committee's consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless it is a fresh point of order, I am not prepared to accept it. I am being as helpful as I can. It is the duty of the Chair to see that the Bill proceeds in the Committee. A simple explanation has been given to the Opposition. The Chair can understand it—and I do not claim to be any better at understanding these matters than other hon. Members. I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 919</span>
see why Opposition Members cannot understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am sorry if I am trying your patience, but I have not understood the position. The Under-Secretary said a minute or two ago that no Government amendments would be moved. I take that to be up to the end of part II of the Bill. I have not had time to check, because this is a surprising and shifting situation, but I am sure that there are Government amendments up to the end of part II which do not appear in the group of 53 amendments put down yesterday, but which were previously on the Notice Paper. On the simple understanding of what the Under-Secretary has said—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not correct. To clarify the situation further, the Clerk has arranged to have an amended selection list circulated to hon. Members in a few minutes, and in the meantime there is nothing to prevent us from proceding with amendment No. 65.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask you, Mr. Gourlay, to reconsider the definition that you gave of the Chairman's role—that it is the duty of a Chairman to ensure that a Bill makes progress? With all respect, I suggest that it is the duty of a Chairman to ensure that the rights of the Members of the House of Commons are protected, even if they are in opposition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The duty of a Chairman is to protect minorities, all Members of the House of Commons and Committees. But it is laid down in Standing Orders and the manual of procedure that it is also the duty of a Chairman that, once a Bill has received its Second Reading in the House and has proceeded to its Committee stage, the Chair must see that the proceedings in Committee move along unless there is some reason for obstruction. I offered earlier this morning to suspend for five or 10 minutes if it would clarify the situation. The Opposition did not accept that. The situation has now been clarified, and, in order to make it even clearer to the Opposition, I have said that I shall circulate an amended selection list which should help the Opposition.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 920</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I place on record my thanks that you have agreed to do something that I asked you to do at 25 minutes to 11. That was all we asked for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that there was no necessity. I trust that the position is now clear. It astonishes me how hon. Members who are capable of dealing with the intricacies of the Bill can fail to understand so simple a point. I think that we may now proceed.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
INTERMEDIATE DIET IN SUMMARY PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, on page 14, leave out lines 43 to 45.<br><br>
The amendment is perhaps of minor importance in itself. However, it deals with a most important clause. The clause has caused much doubt—I almost said resentment, but that might be overstating the case—in the legal profession. There is a good deal of confusion about its intentions and anxiety about the manner in which it may work.<br><br>
It may be helpful—it would certainly shorten the later debate—if I say a word or two about the background to the amendment. I shall discuss the general intention of the clause and give Ministers an opportunity to explain briefly their point of view.<br><br>
The clause introduces an intermediate diet in summary procedure. That is totally new, a procedural innovation. On the face of it, it will create difficulties. New procedures always give rise to problems of organisation, use of staff resources and the taking up of more time in an already violently overcrowded court programme. I should have thought that Ministers would have strong prejudices against cluttering the court calendar with new peremptory diets, intermediate diets, first and second diets, and so on. One of my hon. Friends told me yesterday that every time that he attended the Committee he felt like reaching for his knife and fork—I have some sympathy for that view. Most of my prejudices are against any new intermediate diet. Ministers will have to convince me that the innovation would be useful.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I understand the problem that the clause is intended to tackle. There is much anxiety both among lay hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 921</span>
Members and, no doubt, among the legally qualified hon. Members on the Government side of the Committee, about the habit of withdrawing a plea of not guilty at the last minute—very often on the morning of the trial. By then, much public money will have been spent, not only by the defence from the legal aid fund, but also in the fiscal's department—getting extending police complaints into precognitions. Witnesses, and even jurors if it is an indictment case, will have been inconvenienced by having to come to court. Anyone who has been a witness in Glasgow sheriff court or who has seen the sheep pen conditions in which people giving their time and information to help in the administration of justice are kept will recognise that late pleas are thoroughly undesirable. If there were a practicable way of dealing with that problem without harming the administration of justice, the Opposition would be happy to support it.<br><br>
However, I know from my experience and from that of many colleagues that most solicitors try hard to avoid late pleas. I am sure that the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Under-Secretary will accept that.<br><br>
The problem is often structural or in the mind of the client. I caution the Committee against the assumption that there are a large number of solicitors inciting their clients to plead not guilty, when they know that there is no proper defence, so as to build up a large legal aid account under the comfortable assumption that on the day they can scramble out of it by twisting their client's arm to plead guilty at the last moment. I do not think that that happens. In every professional group—in every group in humanity—there are those who are over-careful of their own interest rather than that of the public. That is inevitable. I do not rule out that possibility in a small number of cases. However, a lot of the abuse is accidental.<br><br>
Such abuse is also a product of the system. If one is appearing as the duty solicitor in the cells in the Glasgow sheriff court—or any other sheriff court, because this is a universal problem—one is given the complaint and has two or three minutes to see one's client. It might be 10 minutes. One says to him "You are charged with breaking into a house at such and such an address. In this true?" He says "No, sir. Not guilty." Then one says "Were you there?" He replies "No, sir. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 922</span>
was in the area. I was with my friend. I had been down to the pub. I was walking up the road when suddenly the police came round the corner and grabbed me. It was nothing to do with me, sir."<br><br>
At that stage, by definition, the solicitor has no precognitions, no information—nothing. He must take his client's word for it. He may be a little sceptical. He may press the client. But, if the client insists that he is not guilty, there is no other plea that the solicitor can offer. Therefore, at that stage, the plea of not guilty goes on the record and one cannot challenge the intransigence, if that is what it may be. Let us not assume that anyone is ever guilty of an offence.<br><br>
However, the plea of not guilty cannot be challenged until one has fully investigated the case and has all the Crown precognitions which give the strength of the Crown case. Only then can one sit down with the client and say "Look, mate, how can you account for the fact that Mrs. McQuaggle was looking out of her window, which is immediately opposite the shop that was broken into, and saw you doing it? Please tell me how you can account for that. They carted you along to the local police station and you said 'It was a fair cop, guv. You'll find the stuff at number so and so,' and the police went along to number so and so and found it."<br><br>
It is only at that stage that a responsible solicitor can start to say to his client "It is not in your interest to go ahead with a trial which is, clearly, a vain and hopeless chase." Even then, if the client says "I did not say that to the police. They are lying." or "Mrs. McQuaggle is blind in both eyes and a dotard, too", and he insists on going to trial, no one can prevent him having that right and privilege.<br><br>
When we are talking about incipient abuses in the system, I believe that a more general abuse, and a more dangerous temptation for the solicitor, is for him to make a judgment, having seen the evidence, that his client has no good defence, and try to twist his arm into changing his plea so that the solicitor may get away to do more valuable and rewarding work.<br><br>
I believe that all of us will have been to court at 10 o'clock on a case about which one may be wrong, but where one believes that there is no real defence, and being quite testy with a client who says "That may be your position, but I intend to continue to plead not guilty, and I want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 923</span>
to go to trial."<br><br>
We have to get this in perspective. It is because of the anxiety about these late pleas that we are being burdened with the intermediate diets which, quite clearly, will be a considerable imposition on shrieval time, on the time of solicitors and the time of the sheriff clerk's departments.<br><br>
This innovation is worrying the legal profession. I shall not go through all the memoranda that we have had, but will take that from the Law Society as representative. The Law Society gave a more detailed argument against the clause than against many of the other clauses which the society opposes. I know, from private conversation—I hope that I am not in any way embarrassing the Law Society by saying this—with those within the Law Society that this is one of the clauses which, in a technical sense, they regard as being particularly unwise.<br><br>
11a.m.<br><br>
The Law Society has argued—I paraphrase—that there are three possible situations. One is that the client genuinely thinks that he is not guilty, and an intermediate diet will not in any way affect that. He will adhere—quite properly—to his plea and take his chance before the court. The second is where the plea is totally false and is a subterfuge. This is not an activity of the criminal classes alone. I may say that the situation in which I have most often suspected that the totally false plea of not guilty has been put in as a subterfuge is when an impeccably middle-class client is faced with charges under section 6 of the 1972 Act and is anxious to postpone to the last possible moment the loss of his driving licence. But when that is so—and it is deplorable—an intermediate diet will not cure it. Therefore we are bringing in here a totally ineffective weapon.<br><br>
The third category is that of which I have been speaking. A client, not anxious to admit his guilt, will to a late stage hold on to his plea of not guilty. Often, thanks to the efforts of his solicitor, he is persuaded at a late stage to change his plea. There we do not need the intermediate diet because we get the plea from him—properly, I hope, and without undue pressure. As the Solicitor-General knows, we can then use the admirable and extremely expeditious machinery set up in section 102 of the 1975 Act.<br><br>
If there is a problem—it can be exag-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 924</span>
gerated—it is one that will not be dealt with by these intermediate diets. I do not want to labour the point, but if the Government are anxious about the problem, there are other ways of dealing with it. There is a lengthy debate in chapter 17 of the Thomson report. The Solicitor-General will be familiar with it. A number of ideas were canvassed, such as that at an early stage Crown precognitions should be made available to the defence. That suggestion was ultimately resisted by Thomson, who came down against it. But it would be a way of solving the problem if the late plea were felt to be so overwhelmingly important and such a major abuse. If at an early stage the Crown says to the defence solicitor "This is what the Crown witnesses are going to say, and here is a copy of the extrajudicial confession that the man made in the police station", the solicitor can go to his client and say "Come off it, chum." The solicitor can put the reality before his client and possibly obtain the early plea which the intermediate diet presumably is intended to extract.<br><br>
Such a method would have another advantage in Tory eyes. It would mean that all that information would be available to the defence without precognition clerks, qualified assistants and apprentices scurrying around seeing all the witnesses off their own bat and running up a quite considerable impost on the legal aid fund. I do not know whether my colleagues in the profession will like this argument, but it seems an important subsidiary reason why, if we are so worried about this, we should consider the possibility of the Crown making available that information and thus giving ammunition to the defence solicitor for a realistic appraisal of his client's chances. This type of appraisal at the moment takes place only at a very late stage, and in a high proportion of cases leads to the late change of plea. We shall have that process at an earlier stage.<br><br>
This might be a helpful suggestion. No doubt the Solicitor-General will already have thought about this and may want to comment upon it. As the clause stands, I believe that these intermediate diets are misguided and will be ineffective.<br><br>
I accept, Mr. Gourlay, that some of the matters that I have raised would be more appropriate to clause stand part, and I shall bear that in mind in terms of anything that I may want to say at that stage. I trust that I am not limiting anyone else's

right. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will wish to contribute to this debate in due course.<br><br>
Amendment No. 65 would take out paragraph (<i>a</i>) which provides that one of the purposes of this intermediate diet should be to ascertain
<br><blockquote><p>"the state of preparation of the prosecutor and of the accused with respect to their cases".</p></blockquote>
I know that I speak for many people when I say that I am worried about what that means.<br><br>
A diet merely for the second purpose of finding out
<br><blockquote><p>"whether the accused intends to adhere to the plea of not guilty"</p></blockquote>
would be quick and might concentrate the minds of the client and his advisers, at a very early stage, on the question whether they are to adhere to their plea. I have explained why I do not consider that it would be a very effective mechanism. By the time one has applied for legal aid and got all one's precognitions in and can really advise one's client, the intermediate diet would have to be very late indeed if a change of plea was to be responsibly possible—if the Committee follows the line of argument.<br><br>
I can see the simple thought behind the idea that the intermediate diet should consider whether there is an intention to adhere. But I want to know why the sheriff should be asked to look into
<br><blockquote><p>"the state of preparation of the prosecutor and of the accused with respect to their cases",</p></blockquote>
and what that means. I do not want to exaggerate, but I can think of one or two gentlemen on the shrieval bench who might take that duty very seriously indeed. There might be lengthy exchanges which would not improve relations between the Bench and the local bar, or between the Bench and the procurator fiscal's department.<br><br>
Would this inquiry into the state of preparation of the defence include a right for the sheriff to demand to see any precognitions that had already been acquired? Would he be allowed to ask why they were not available? Would he be allowed, if he had seen them, to say to the client: "I do not care what your solicitor says. I think you have no case. Why the hell are you going to waste my time and, later on, the time of one of my colleagues?" There are people whose "enthusiasm"—I use the word in inverted commas—would take them into that area.<br><br>
If the Bench is not to be allowed to ask
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 926</span>
where the precognitions are, what they say and "Why are you going to waste my time by going to trial when clearly you have no defence?", what is the point of paragraph (<i>a</i>)? If it does not allow for such questions it is redundant, and if it does it is positively dangerous.<br><br>
The only other possible implication of the paragraph is that we may be inviting the sheriff to act as a plea broker. I did not think of that possibility, but it has been put to me by one or two of my colleagues. Having demanded to know about the state of preparation of the defence—and so, presumably, the contents of the defence, too—the sheriff could suggest to the procurator fiscal that he should be thinking in terms of dropping charge 4, for instance, and perhaps thinking about pleading. Before we know where we are, the sheriff will be acting in what may be an interesting role but is certainly a novel role which I should be sorry to see imported into the clause by the back door.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides a very dangerous opening for people to abuse their position. There could be bullying, not to put too fine a point on it—I am not making any accusations against any specific people but that is a very real danger and one that the clause should not countenance—or an opportunity for an extension of role that would be unwelcome and unwanted.<br><br>
I hope that amendment No. 65 will be accepted by the Solicitor-General. I cannot see why it should not be accepted. We may still want to vote against the clause, but some of our morepressingfearsaboutabuse will have been removed. I hope that having briefly outlined the important arguments, I may allow others to take up the theme. This is an important clause. At first sight one might skim over it—it looks dry, dusty, technical and uninteresting—but it raises important issues and would affect the conduct of the criminal justice system in Scotland. I hope that the Solicitor-General will not feel that it is unnecessary fully to investigate and examine this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It
would save the time of the Committee and clarify the position if I were to outline the Government's position at this stage. I say with respect to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that, if I had been able to do so before he spoke, many of the adumbrations and fantasies which he conjured up need not have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0563">Image</span>

rehearsed.<br><br>
In more than 50 per cent. of all summary cases in the major sheriff courts, the accused pleads guilty in some form, at least on the day of the trial. There is the expenditure of the preparation of the trial by both sides, the attendance of the solicitor for trial, the waiting fee he obtains and all the other expenses, together with the inconvenience of all the witnesses, be they lay, police or specialists, who have to attend and wait at court unnecessarily. This is a matter that I regard of such importance and such wrong that we must find an answer to it. If nothing else, it means that a large number of people who might get legal aid by the enlarging of the categories, the amounts or the allowances, do not get it because this money is wasted. I do not say that it is wasted on this purpose, but it goes directly to the legal profession. That is a problem which I trust that no member of the Committee regards as being other than urgent to solve.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Garscadden said, the solicitors and the Law Society have the greatest reservations about the introduction of an intermediate diet. They acknowledge the problem. My noble Friend the Lord Advocate has invited them, both in discussion and by letter, to propose solutions. No solutions have been proposed by those who complain of this solution—I will turn to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Garscadden in a moment because it has in large part been affected.<br><br>
Therefore, it is essential that what at best is a wrong and at worst an outrage should not be allowed to continue at such vast expense and inconvenience. Also, it makes the ordinary running of the law in the sheriff court massively difficult. For instance, a procurator fiscal may have to put down for trial on one day six to 10 cases in the knowledge that at most three could be fitted in on that day. Then there are the others who will plead at the last moment after witnesses have been called and hung about all day at great expense. That is a wrong and the clause is aimed at curing it. Therefore we intend to introduce intermediate diet experimentally to attempt to reduce the amount of late information.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a Pavlovian reaction. In view of the scorn and almost the contempt with which we were treated by the Under-Secretary of State when we suggested experimental trial periods for law reform measures, I am fascinated to know of and to welcome the experiment. It is on the statute book. There is no apparent time limit. What does the experiment mean? If it fails, is there to be repealing legislation? Will the Solicitor-General please tell us a little more about that?</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am
perfectly prepared to acknowledge the admission of the hon. Member for Garscadden that his reaction and that of his hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) was Pavlovian because we know the extent of Pavlov's experiments. He had the ability to make dogs dribble at a sign of a signal.<br><br>
Perhaps the use of the word "experimentally" is one that I do not regret, but I had forgotten that I had left the Pavlov tap on. I meant that we are introducing the intermediate diet to be used with discretion by the sheriff court in such cases and circumstances as it appears to be useful to achieve this objective of reducing pleas at the trial diet when all the witnesses have been called. We hope it will work. We must try anything that appears to achieve that objective—that is what I meant by the use of that term. Anything that has never before been tried is, in any circumstances, experimental in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the hon. and learned Gentleman's definition of the word "experimental". It does credit to his ingenuity but not to his knowledge of the English language. Obviously, by the word "experimental" he merely means that its use will be at the discretion of the courts. That is self-evident because, presumably, there will not be an intermediate diet in-every case. Therefore, it is quite mise leading to try to shelter behind thd explanation that it will not be usee universally in order to get out of the usd of the word "experimental". The hon. anf learned Gentleman must offer us more o an explanation of what he meant by the term "experimental".<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 929</span>
I ask the Solicitor-General another question, and it will save time if he will deal with it now. Obviously, it will be selective, but who will do the selecting? Is it to be the fiscal, the sheriff clerk or the the sheriff himself? Although it is to be left to the discretion of the court, I do not know who will constitute the court. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee exactly what is the machinery of selection and what criteria he expects to be used?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is perfectly simple. The sheriff will do the selecting but there is no reason why either the solicitor for the defence or the procurator fiscal cannot ask for an intermediate diet in a particular case.<br><br>
I address myself to paragraph (<i>a</i>), which the amendment seeks to remove. According to the Law Society, the reason for a large number of late pleas is because the client does not see his solicitor, despite the fact that legal aid has been obtained, until the day of the trial or the day before. In that situation he is not fulfilling the conditions of his legal aid certificate by which he is required to co-operate with his solicitor in the preparation of his defence with dispatch. Accordingly, the purpose of paragraph (<i>a</i>) is so that the court may ask "Have you prepared your case?" If the answer is "No. My client has never been to see me", the client is not entitled to legal aid and the certificate can be suspended.<br><br>
If the cause of the wrong is that the client is not willing to fulfil the conditions upon which the certificate was granted in the first instance, let us have a method of curing that wrong because the sheriff can say at the intermediate diet "If your client does not see you within seven days I shall suspend the certificate." To whatever extent that is the excuse, once legal aid is granted for the preparation of the defence it is very important that the proper co-operation to prevent late pleas should be forthcoming from the client.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General talked about seven days in relation to the legal certificate. I may be ignorant, but is that the position or is it a suggestion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It
was merely a suggestion. The sheriff could suspend it or not suspend it, de-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 930</span>
pending upon the explanation. But the point is that the court and the Law Society will not know that the client is in breach of the conditions of his certificate and, as far as I know, solicitors do not ring up the Law Society and say "Please suspend this certificate so that I do not get the benefit of preparing the defence because the client has not been to see me and is in breach of the conditions." That does not happen.<br><br>
It is equally important on the other side. If the reason for a late plea is because the fiscal has not prepared his case and has not given information to the solicitor that has been demanded, that is another matter that ought to be known.<br><br>
In Glasgow we introduced a registry-attached fiscal to answer the problem that was raised by the hon. Member for Garscadden. That was, namely, as was argued in the Thomson report, and for other reasons that are not argued in Thomson, that there are fundamental difficulties of principle in handing the Crown's precognitions to the defence and saying "You get on with it; that is our case."<br><br>
One of the fundamental difficulties is whether a precognition is confidential. One cannot ask someone to give a statement in confidence and then hand it to somebody else who may use it to make life difficult. For instance, one may read what Mrs. McQuaggle—I think that is the lady in question—is alleged to have said. The precognition chart or the solicitor goes to her and says "You didn't see this, did you?" There are many difficulties about handing over Crown precognition.<br><br>
The function and use of the registry-attached fiscal—my Noble and learned Friend has by order extended the number of those fiscals—is so that any defence solicitor can ask, and I hope all defence solicitors will ask, "What is the strength of the Crown's case? Is the identity of the driver established? What was the alcohol level?" In the instruction there is also given the rule that all technical evidence shall be given to the defence solicitor. That includes such matters as blood-alcohol, fingerprints and so on.<br><br>
By that system we hope to assist the defence solicitor, or at least to knock the prop away from the late plea "If only the Crown had told us how strong its case was we could have pled earlier." Any system is helpful that removes even one late plea that could have been made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 931</span>
earlier so that the witnesses could be cancelled and ensures that this appalling abuse is brought to an end.<br><br>
If members of the Committee have alternative or additional suggestions on how we can achieve the saving of time and money and remove that abuse from the summary procedure of the law of Scotland, we shall be delighted to consider them. We believe that the introduction of an intermediate diet will go some way to assisting in pleas of a sensible nature and at a sensible time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak because I have been in correspondence with my hon. and learned Friend and asked questions on this very matter—pleading not guilty on first diet and on second diet the solicitor persuading his client to plead guilty.<br><br>
In my constituency there have been cases where known violent thugs have been caught red-handed by the police and and where clearly, at the trial, there would be no alternative to a verdict of guilty. They have pleaded not guilty on first diet. The police and independent witnesses have been called to court and the accused have pleaded guilty on second diet.<br><br>
This is causing deep concern. We have heard much about the problems of the relationship between the police and the public, but it is time that we considered the relationship between the public and solicitors. As the days, months and years pass, solicitors are no longer retaining the admiration and respect that they once had in Scotland. I am sorry to say that. A cornerstone, a part of our law and order and judicial system, must be respect for those who are seeking justice. I wish clearly to state that there are solicitors who abuse the system. The only people to gain from that are the solicitors themselves, who gain financially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman name the solicitors and the firms concerned so that the people of Scotland may know who they are and avoid going to them? We shall then have rooted them out. What a splendid contribution to the work of this Committee the hon. Member will then have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a most interesting proposal. On the day when Labour Members name a policeman in their indictment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 932</span>
of the police I shall be delighted to name solicitors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not good enough, and is certainly not acceptable to us. The hon. Gentleman should not attack professions in this way. He does it all the time. He usually attacks social workers. Some of us are fed up listening to the hon. Gentleman's tirades. On every occasion that the Committee meets he makes these attacks. He avoids sitting all night but he comes to the Committee during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has sunk to such depths. I should be delighted to sit all night at any time. I shall swap my back for his at any time he wishes. My reason for not being in attendance was not of my own wish—as you know, Mr. Gourlay—but because I was paired with an hon. Member for whom I have great respect who had to be absent. Incidentally, he is still absent. I believe sincerely that what I have said must be said. That is one of the reasons for our debates. We must not merely abuse the police.<br><br>
There is deep concern in Scotland. I referred to my constituency, and my constituents who read these proceedings will know that I am referring to known villains. It is always a great surprise to my constituents when on first diet they plead not guilty and on second diet they plead guilty. That has happened not once but many times. One example is a whole family, the members of which are known villains.<br><br>
Attempts to reduce the misuse of public funds ensure that more funds will be available to those who genuinely need them, who are innocent and desperately need funds for their defence. We should be considering those persons and not the villains or the solicitors who set out to abuse the system.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to confine my remarks to the amendment as I tried to confine them to clause 4 on Tuesday when we were discussing whether the clause should remain part of the Bill.<br><br>
This is an extremely important amendment. That was indicated by the time that the Solicitor-General took to deal with it. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 933</span>
welcome that. It underlines what we were saying earlier—namely, the sheer impossibility of trying to cope with these matters in any of the time-scales that have been suggested.<br><br>
Three groups are likely to be affected by the clause. The Law Society spells that out satisfactorily. First, there are those who plead not guilty. They feel that they are not guilty and they have no intention of changing their pleas. We accept that the clause will not affect the genuine.<br><br>
The second group consists of those who wish to postpone the evil hour and consequently plead not guilty at intermediate diet. If they are set on the course of postponement, that is a hiccup, but the case has to continue.<br><br>
We are left with those who know that they are guilty and who intend at the last minute to plead guilty, or are advised to do so. That is the only group with which the amendment deals. The provision is designed with section 337 of the 1975 Act in mind, which I think is highly dangerous.<br><br>
Those who wish genuinely to change their plea to that of guilty have a mechanism open to them—namely, section 102. That group is thus already taken care of. It is not necessary to speed up that process. Secondly, there is great danger, especially in this section, in the inquiry into
<br><blockquote><p>"the state of preparation of the prosecutor and of the accused with respect to their cases".</p></blockquote>
It does not apply only to paragraph (<i>b</i>) where the accused
<br><blockquote><p>"intends to adhere to the plea of not guilty".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (<i>a</i>), followed by paragraph (<i>b</i>), is an important new concept. It brings plea bargaining into open court and makes it part of the process of law. That is the main feature.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General for Scotland said that the reason for that is expense—namely, the time taken up by solicitors and the court's time. He said that it was important that there should be some saving. He claimed that that was crucial, and it was his only reason. He argued that any system that would stop even one late plea would be helpful. That is abysmal nonsense. It is equally nonsense to say that we must equate the proper operation of the law with its cost. There has to be an argument in legal terms and in terms of justice on cost.<br><br>
I am in favour of cutting costs. I take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 934</span>
the argument of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) but I do not agree with his portmanteau approach. I should prefer to see a salaried staff of solicitors. I am concerned with expense, but expense must not be spared at the cost of justice.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General said that no solutions were proposed, but solutions have been proposed, as was indicated in the Thomson report. The solutions were discarded. The key solution is in
<br><blockquote><p>"the state of preparation of the prosecutor and of the accused with respect to their cases".</p></blockquote>
The prosecution should make known the dossier or case to the defence.<br><br>
The only argument made against that by the Solicitor-General, and to some extent by the Thomson report, was that matters might be confidential.<br><br>
The Thomson report, on page 90, paragraph 17.11—by the way, this is strictly relevant to the amendment, Mr. Gourlay—says:
<br><blockquote><p>"witnesses who give precognitions to the Crown should be entitled to assume that what they say on precognition will not be disclosed to any third party, least of all—"</p></blockquote>
why "least of all"?
<br><blockquote><p>"—to the accused or his legal adviser."</p></blockquote>
Some of us may think that that ought to be "most of all". I know the reason for saying it. The problem is that the accused may be connected in some way with the victim or the witness. But why "least of all"? The interests of justice happen to matter. I do not accept that, nor do I
accept the Solicitor-General's declaration of it.<br><br>
We are concerned not with commercial advantage but with the kind of evidence on precognition which would be brought out in the court. If it is to be brought out in open court, there is no reason why it should not be given to the defence in advance, because confidentiality at the point of the case will go anyway. If there is any other aspect in the precognition, it can be taken out, but by definition that which can be or is intended to be adduced in the court should be given to the defence because the question of confidentiality, by definition, does not arise. The hon. and learned Gentleman is not only wrong, he is totally wrong. I do not accept that argument.<br><br>
Thomson had a better argument. The report said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Disclosure may not be to the advantage of the defence since the precognition may give only one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 935</span>
side of the case and may thus discourage further exploration of the facts on the part of the defence."</p></blockquote>
Now the Government say that we should not assist the defence by giving the prosecution case because that would hinder the defence. That is nonsense. If it inhibits the solicitor from pursuing the case further, the solicitor should be sacked. But if it becomes part of the normal structure, as I believe it should, it will be normal for the solicitor to take in the prosecution case. I think that the Solicitor-General's case not only falls, but falls totally.<br><br>
I am concerned that this measure should be brought in in such a careless way. I admired the Solicitor-General when I arrived and saw him in his butcher's apron of a shirt. I now realise he was wearing it as a symbol of his butchery of Scottish law.<br><br>
Those are the main points. My real worry about the entire clause—I am not making a "clause stand part" speech but only a passing reference—is that it can seriously change the whole nature of the Scottish law. From this nettle danger we can pluck back the one word "justice". Justice would come if the Solicitor-General would accept the alternative, which he saw, of making the prosecution case available to the defence. That would help to bring the matter to a more successful and just conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise only briefly to speak on the amendment. There has been reference to stand part speeches, and I do not want to enter into that, except to say that if there was a "stand part" speech it was the Solicitor-General's. As I remember, he made not a single reference to the amendments nominally under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I advised the hon. Gentleman that the purpose of paragraph (<i>a</i>) was to discover whether the defence was ready, and if not, why not, and whether the Crown was ready, and if not, why not. I briefly add something to which the hon. Member referred. Of course, it may be that the defence would like an acceleration of diet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not find any reasonable explanation of why this amendment was unnecessary. It is a serious amendment in the sense that it would take away the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 936</span>
principal cause of anxiety which the Solicitor-General was good enough to recognise existed in the legal profession. I am tempted to ask some specific questions. For example, if the sheriff is to decide on the selection, what criteria does the Solicitor-General imagine he will use? He will presumably look down the list of all the summary cases in his court, poor man. He will decide to have procurator fiscal <i>v.</i> Snooks but not procurator fiscal <i>v.</i> Brown. Is that on the basis that he does not trust the agent in the case and thinks it particularly important to have an inquiry, or will the matter be governed by the nature of the offence under consideration?<br><br>
I know that the Solicitor-General will say that discretion lies with the sheriff, but the hon. and learned Gentleman is of a standing in life that might have enabled him to rise to those heights. He might well have become a sheriff, and presumably he can put himself in a sheriff's position. I should be interested to know what criteria he thinks the sheriff should apply.<br><br>
Before I decide whether we should press the amendment to a Division, the Solicitor-General should explain to us the exact nature of an inquiry into
<br><blockquote><p>"the state of preparation of the prosecutor and of the accused".</p></blockquote>
Will the sheriff be able to ask the accused's solicitor "Why is your man adhering to his plea? May I see the precognitions?" Will he be able to demand from the solicitor at least sight of the preparations and an assurance that the precognitions are to hand? Will he be entitled to ask, for example, the nature of the defence? I want to know a good deal more about what the sheriff will be empowered to do under paragraph (<i>a</i>). If we are not to take the paragraph out of the Bill, the intermediate diet will be merely an opportunity to ascertain
<br><blockquote><p>"Whether the accused intends to adhere to the plea of not guilty".</p></blockquote>
We are entitled to this information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I inadvertently nodded when the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said that section 102 was the method by which one submitted a plea of guilty. That is in solemn and not summary cases. It is done by section 314(3) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, namely, by applying on joint motion for an accelerated diet.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Solicitor-General repeat that answer more slowly to ensure that it has been recorded?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am
sure that with their usual efficiency the Official Reporters will grasp the intricacies of the 1975 Act.<br><br>
I turn to the point made by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West. When the Lord Advocate discussed whether it would be helpful and would save money if Crown precognitions were given to the defence, the Law Society said "Yes, but we would have to get our own precognitions after that." No money, therefore, would be saved. All that it would do, in most cases, is tell the defence what it had to get round in what Mrs. McQuaggle had said. It would then say "This is what you say, is it? That is not right is it?" It would be most improper, would lead to a considerable abuse of procedure, and would save nothing. In the system that we have introduced, the procurator fiscal will be able to say "I can tell you that you are identified by eight witnesses and that your fingerprints are on the knife."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, by the production of the prosecution case to the defence, the solicitor was put in a position to recommend his client to plead guilty, money would be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No solicitor would do that. He would say "I had better check that that is what Mrs. McQuaggle said." He would see the strength of her conviction and would be able to precognise her at length, get the preparation for trial fee and put in his account. [<i>Interruption</i>]. I do not say that solicitors are crooks. I merely say that in many cases the work is unnecessary.<br><br>
I tell the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that, of course, the sheriff cannot ask to see the precognitions. At the intermediate diet the sheriff might ask whether there was any change of plea or whether the accused wished to persist with his plea. There might be a valid defence, and the solicitor might say that there was a valid defence. The hon. Gentleman has said that he has had cases in which he considered that there was not a valid defence apart from the denial of everything—the denial of overwhelming evidence. Technically, that is a valid defence, because one is innocent until
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 938</span>
proved guilty. However, I suspect that in such a case the hon. Member for Garscadden would say to the court something like "The accused insists on his plea of not guilty."<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The sheriff might well want to know how it came about that at the intermediate diet everyone was ready to go to trial, the defence insisted that it had a case, and then a fortnight later when all the witnesses had turned up, the plea was guilty.<br><br>
The alibi—to put it rightly or wrongly—that the Law Society alleges as the cause of many late pleas is the non-attendance of the client, the non-co-operation of the client with his solicitor. It will now be possible to ask the solicitor at the intermediate diet "Why are you not ready?" If he replies that the client is not cooperating, that person will forfeit his right to legal aid. The solicitor will no longer have the alternative of claiming that he has prepared a case. It has to be one or the other. No inquiry into the details of the precognitions and so on is proposed or would be competent under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am not satisfied that the words should remain. I appreciate the Solicitor-General's good intentions; he has simply got the problem out of proportion. He exaggerates the benefits of the measure. It may strike effectively at what he described as the alibi explanation: "It was really my client's fault; he did not come in and give instructions." To do so would no doubt have some significance. However, we would also be lumbering the courts with a new intermediate diet, for attending which solicitors would presumably be able to charge the legal aid fund. I am not sure that we should save much in terms of overall public expenditure.<br><br>
Having listened to the Solicitor-General, I am not convinced that the words in paragraph (<i>a</i>) are necessary. They should be taken out. I did indeed say that there were occasions when one said to one's client that there was no good defence. That occurs in private conversation with clients. One is duty-bound to give such advice if it is the client's interest. One may say "There is no defence to the charge of assault. If you insist in the face of all the evidence on going ahead, that is your privilege. However, I must warn you
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 939</span>
that by the time all the evidence has been given, the offence will sound almost like attempted murder. You would do much better to accept now the reality that you acted unwisely and punched someone."That would be informal good advice.<br><br>
However, when in that situation one is asked from the Bench "Have you got a good defence, Mr. Dewar?" one might signal to the Bench by replying "Yes, my Lord. My client denies the charge." Perhaps a perceptive sheriff would take a hint from that. However, it is still a good defence as far as the client is concerned to say that everyone is lying except him.<br><br>
I am interested in the situation posited by the Solicitor-General. What does the sheriff then do? It seems to me that all that he can do is to say, perhaps rather grumpily, "Oh, very well then." He cannot start an inquiry into that "valid defence." The solicitor must say that he has a valid defence, because his client who is continuing to maintain his in-</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. This may be the most opportune moment to raise this point of order in view of the fact that the Committee has just voted, because it concerns the names of those who voted as a result of our proceedings. May I draw your attention to c.735 of the <i>Official Report</i> of our twelfth sitting on Tuesday 3 June? Under the "Noes" there are recorded the following names:

<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3 June 1980; c.735.]</p></blockquote>
I could continue, but my point is that "Scotland Bill" does not serve on this Committee. For the accuracy of the record, it is wise to point that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee and <i>Hansard are</i> obliged to the hon.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 940</span>
<p>nocence, is innocent until proved guilty.</p>
<p>The whole thing seems quite mistaken to me. I fear that the inclusion of paragraph (<i>a</i>) gives an impression—it has certainly taken root in the mind of the Law Society of Scotland—that certain sheriffs will take it into their heads that they can follow up their suspicions and start rooting around into what constitutes the defence, and its validity. To take out those words would avoid that. It would leave the intermediate diet intact, for what it is worth—as the Committee will have gathered, I think that it is worth very little. But the rather dangerous possibility of a new role for the sheriff as a kind of inquisitor, an arbitrator of whether the defence is valid, will be removed. I therefore advise my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>
<p>Gentleman for drawing attention to the new member of the Committee. No doubt the staff of <i>Hansard</i> will take appropriate action.</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be brief and to make three quick points. The first relates to costs. This is clearly bringing in a new procedure. I do not think that the definition of costs put forward by the Solicitor-General will be borne out in the event. A new structure will be required. There will be the employment of solicitors' time and the time of court officials and the sheriff. So all the nonsense that we have heard about expense should be discounted.<br><br>
My second point is that the clause states "may", not "shall". "May" does not help the situation because the sheriff will have to select which cases he will hear. So we have the prospect of a sheriff going through all the cases in front of him in the courts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 941</span>
of Glasgow at any one time to decide which merit investigation. On what criteria will the sheriff base his decision? Is it to be the length of time that the case has taken? That could be because of the overcrowding of cases before the courts.<br><br>
Then there are requests for postponement. Often such a request is made when a case is difficult. I do not think that the solicitor described by the Solicitor-General would make such a request in order to claim more funds. Can the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee what criteria will be used? If it is not length of time, what will it be? The sheriff will not know until he has the intermediate diet what the state of preparation of the prosecutor or the accused is. Until he calls the case, he will not know that the accused intends to change his plea. Will he begin the investigation in advance of the diet, acquainting himself with the state of preparation to say that case A merits an intermediate diet and case B does not? If he does, he is taking the role of an additional procurator fiscal. That seems complete nonsense. We should like to know the criteria and whether this is really what the hon. and learned Gentleman wants.<br><br>
Thirdly, and even more crucially, it is changing his role, in however small a fashion, into that of a sort of inquisitor into the legal process. That is significant because we have already introduced this into Scottish law through clause 6 where we have injected into an accusatorial system—the traditional system of British justice—an inquisitorial system through the judicial examination. Therefore, we have already introduced that in one way, and we are bringing it in again.<br><br>
I do not use the word "alien" in a pejorative way, but it is an alien structure of justice that has been brought in. It alters in an inquisitorial direction the role of the sheriff, as we have already altered it in relation to an inquiry through the judicial examination. I ask the Government to think again. Their sole argument for the change, which in relation to clause 6 and this one must be seen as a major change in Scottish law, has been that of cost. First, I do not believe that cost is more important than justice. Secondly, I believe the Solicitor-General has vastly overestimated the amount of saving. Thirdly, in relation to clause stand part—I referred to this when dealing with the amendment and, therefore, I shall not dwell on the question—there is the whole process of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 942</span>
prosecution and defence.<br><br>
When I was in charge of law and order in Scotland, I was not even asked to think about the role of the Crown and procurator fiscal, which was not to arrive at a successful prosecution but at the truth. This was what was good about the Scottish system and the procurator fiscal. It was his task not to obtain a successful prosecution but to arrive at the truth and justice. Therefore, it seems that if this sort of change is to be imported into the structure—I think it should be wiped out—the substitute and alternative should be the provision by the prosecution of its evidence to the defence. That seems to aim at what we believed was the traditional goal of arriving at the truth and assists the defence in that.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General says that this will merely assist the defence to find a way round. But if the defence attempts to find a way round and succeeds, it will be because the defence has found out more truths. The matter still has to be decided by the courts. There is nothing wrong in the defence asking whether there is anything wrong with the prosecution case. Of course, there must be a list, and we accept that. It is to help in this process, which is of value in itself, and I believe it is the proper substitute for this sort of intermediate diet nonsense.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will think seriously about withdrawing the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important clause, and I believe we have been right to devote so much time to it. I do not intend to review my arguments. The Committee knows that I am extremely sceptical about the worth of this innovation.<br><br>
I stress to the Solicitor-General that it will be a considerable imposition on the court machinery if it is used to any extent. What is more, it will be an imposition on the legal aid fund because the solicitor will have to be paid for it. The Government must have considered that when deciding what balance of convenience was to be struck. It is also an imposition on an accused party and we must not assume that accused parties are guilty parties.<br><br>
I take as an example the most commonplace circumstance of an ordinary summary trial at present. The accused is arrested, held overnight in the cells, appears in court and is bailed. At that stage, as the Solicitor-General knows, he has to face all the difficulties of proving his innocence. This is a matter that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 943</span>
shall not be discussing under the Bill and had it not been for my anxiety not to obstruct new clauses, I might have tabled an amendment to deal with it, but in Scotland we have no provision for awarding costs to someone who is found innocent in a criminal trial in the way that exists in England. It may be that there will be considerable impositions upon somebody who is ultimately found innocent in terms of time off work and the expenses of his defence if he is not legally aided. It may be that the Solicitor-General will tell me that a criterion that a sheriif will use is that this will only be in an intermediate diet in a legally aided case, but I do not know. Perhaps the sheriffs will use their discretion otherwise. Whether the case is legally aided or not, the import will be that the accused as well as his solicitor, will now have to turn up for the intermediate diet. The accused will have to take time off work for that, and no doubt it will be summoned at 10 o'clock. In a busy court such as that in Glasgow, there may be 50 or 60 cases, so he will have to wait while the validity of the defence is investigated and to see whether there is a defence. He will find himself facing yet another day's loss of wages. This is for a man who at that point is presumed innocent and, at the end of the day, may well be innocent.<br><br>
There are myriads of arguments that we could use. That is another reason why we should look at the matter very sceptically.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
In Glasgow sheriff court at the moment an ordinary summary trial has been fixed five or six months ahead because of the burden of work. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will argue that there will be great savings because we shall not have trial diets that are not proceeded with. But I wonder how many, in fact, will fall by the wayside as a result of this machinery. I do not believe that it is in the interests of justice. I believe that it is putting the sheriff into an unfortunate position.<br><br>
I was very interested in the remarks about the registry-attached fiscal. I am not sure that the registry-attached fiscal will thank the Solicitor-General for those remarks, because I do not think that solicitors at the moment are making a great deal of use of this provision. They did not know that it was there. I shall certainly spread
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 944</span>
the word that at any point we can get into touch with the registry-attached solicitor who will be in a position to let us know the details and strength of the Crown's case.<br><br>
The blood count was an unfortunate and strange example for the Solicitor-General to use because ultimately such information will be served, anyway. But I take his general point that if we want to know the strength of identification or the reply to question and charge, we phone the registry-attached fiscal and get that information. The registry-attached fiscal may be a busy gentleman, given the number of summary cases pending in Glasgow sheriff court.<br><br>
I am genuinely grateful for that information. It will be useful. I, and certainly my colleagues, will be using it from now on. It will be helpful to get the details of the Crown's case at an early stage. It is not widely known in legal circles that that service is available, and I am most grateful to the Solicitor-General. I shall certainly be helpful in spreading the news that service will be made available.<br><br>
My final point is merely to pick up the argument of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), because it goes to the heart of the motivation behind this new clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire sees solicitors as dishonest. I am sorry that he is out of the room. I presume that he does not see all solicitors as dishonest. But he certainly has a general paranoid feeling, particularly about those solicitors who practise in courts. It is rather strange that this feeling is not, apparently, transferred to the Faculty of Advocates. But certainly those of us who practise in the criminal courts are seen, as a body, to be dishonest. No doubt there are individual shining examples of virtue within that body.<br><br>
In my opening remarks, I cautioned the Committee against the assumption that there was widespread abuse. I shall make that remark a little stronger by saying that I do not believe that there is widespread abuse at all. There may be individuals who abuse the system, as there are in any professional grouping or in any grouping in any walk of life. But, without wanting to sound over-anxious or over-sensitive, I must protest that there are not widespread abuses of the sort that the hon. Member thinks. The Law Society keeps a fairly careful eye on this matter and, if those abuses existed we, as a profession, would be extremely anxious to do something
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 945</span>
about them.<br><br>
There is a feeling abroad that certain groups and professions are dishonest. The most obvious example is Members of Parliament. People from normal walks of life say that politicians are dishonest. It comes out in all the opinion polls, and again and again in conversation. Politicians are not trusted. Most people in this room see that politicians are average in that respect. I do not claim that we are more or less honest than anyone else. But I think that most politicians, like most other people, try to do a reasonably honest and responsible job. It is the same with a solicitor. I think that the public paranoia about Members of Parliament is reflected in the parallel individual paranoia of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire when it comes to solicitors.<br><br>
I want to put on the record—I hope that it will not be resented by the Committee—that I believe that such an accusation is unjustified and that, to some extent, we are tilting at windmills. There is a problem but it is not as big as has been suggested. I believe that—to continue with a rather forced metaphor—the lance of legislation that the Solicitor-General is using will be extremely ineffective. I would rather do without the clause altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is clearly giving cause for concern. When I examined the press material that the Government gave out at the time of the Bill's publication, I paid particular attention to the reference to this clause in the context of the Bill. We must establish whether the whole of the Bill, with the possible exception of clause 15, has come from the first, second or third Thomson reports, the Bryden report or the Dunpark report on reparation by offender. All those reports are credited with being the parents of most of the clauses in the Bill; the other clauses are credited to the Conservative Party's manifesto for Scotland at the general election, although when I read it I did not find that the matters in question were included.<br><br>
I say that because I am worried about the effect of the clause on court business. I recognise that there is a problem about legal aid and late change of plea. I do not share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that there is no major problem. I am anxious to try to find some way of dealing with it.<br><br>
However, I am also anxious to establish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 946</span>
that the idea behind clause 15 emanated from the Crown Office. The Solicitor-General was much nearer the mark than he cared to tell the Committee when he said that the approach was very experimental. My concern is that at present we have two diets—a pleading diet and a trial diet. Under the clause, unless someone pleads guilty at the pleading diet there will still be two diets and possibly three. Let us suppose that at the intermediate diet the accused maintains his innocence when he is asked by the sheriff whether he will plead not guilty at the trial diet. Far from removing a diet, we shall have added one and caused three to take place—the pleading diet, the intermediate diet and the trial diet—when at present there are only two.<br><br>
All I am telling the Solicitor-General, in the most helpful way that I can, is that when the clause becomes law it may be seen that the procedure is added further to the burden of court work—particularly in Glasgow sheriff court, which is the busiest in Scotland—and to the cost of legal aid. I believe that that is running at about £9 million a year in Scotland for civil and criminal cases; I am talking about a massive amount of public expenditure.<br><br>
I ask the Solicitor-General for an undertaking that the Government will recognise—I am sorry that he backed away when the matter was mentioned previously—that it is an experiment and that it can be withdrawn if it is seen to be not as effective as the Crown Office apparently thinks it will.<br><br>
I believe—no doubt, the Solicitor-General will confirm or deny it—that the origin of the proposal is in the Crown Office. Perhaps the thinking was inspired by Thomson, who considered the argument but rejected it. That is important. The proposal is not attributed to any of the published reports, and was certainly not contained in the Conservative Party's election manifesto. That is referred to in the press handouts at the time of the publication of the Bill.<br><br>
The only other possible sources left are the Scottish Office and the Crown Office. As the Solicitor-General is replying to the debate, that means it is the Crown Office. If it is not as effective as the Solicitor-General hopes it will be, I trust that we shall be sensible enough to return to the question and take it off the statute book, if it seems to be adding to legal aid costs and the burden of work in the sheriff courts.<br><br>
Finally, there is one example on which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 947</span>
we can draw for comparison with this type of proposal. I remember when the Private Member's Bill, introduced by the predecessor of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Mackay), was going through the House, great hopes were expressed that removing all additional grounds for divorce and instituting one ground only—the irretrievable breakdown of marriage—would speed up divorce actions.<br><br>
I think that I am right in saying that this result has not materialised. I suspect that is because the numbers are increasing, and that a whole host of other factors is involved. This is a loose example to call in aid to back up my argument. I trust that the Solicitor-General will not back away from the experimental approach that he seemed to be taking. If it is proving ineffective, we can come back and take it off the statute book. That would be a sensible approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased and encouraged by the helpful speech of the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). It was a most constructive contribution to our debates. I am also delighted that he dissociates himself fully from the comments made about the abuse of the system in Scotland. I am pleased that he disagreed—as I understand it—with his hon. Friend on this matter. I may have misheard but I thought that he said that he did not agree with his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), in that there is concern, there is some abuse and something has to be done about it. That was my understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman—with great respect—must not put words into my mouth. I chose my words carefully. I said that I did not quite share the enthusiasm of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for the belief that there is not something wrong with the late change of plea at the trial diet. As a Minister myself and having to deal with the problem, I recognised that there was a problem and I was anxious to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted at that clarification and also to be able to say that I concur with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. It is also my own view. If I over-stressed my case, I apologise, but I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 948</span>
withdraw my remarks about the abuse. I do not withdraw what I said about the only people to gain being solicitors, nor do I withdraw in any way the opinion that grave concern is felt by many of us at the lack of respect for solicitors in Scotland.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will acknowledge that we are looking to this part of the Bill to deal with the problem that we have discussed fairly fully. If it should add to the cost burden and should be found with experience to be an additional cost factor on legal aid, I hope that something will be done about it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said. I think it is a serious problem, and in the spirit of the clause I shall plead guilty rather than go to trial, and say that as much as anybody I hope that I am the author or promoter of this suggestion. Suggestions were made by Thomson, discussions have been had with all interested parties, and until the interested parties come up with better suggestions, this is the best so far. Certainly, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we want to make this proposal work. It will be used as and when it is useful. We shall keep a careful eye on it to see if it proves unsuccessful or burdensome in particular cases, or is more usefully used in others.<br><br>
I turn to what was said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about rejecting concepts of trust. If, for instance, Members of Parliament received £5 every time that they wrote a letter—in other words, itemised benefit—they might write more letters. On the legal aid fund there is itemised benefit. All that I can say to the hon. Member for Garscadden is that I was appalled and astonished when he said that he did not know about the registry fiscal. There has been one in Glasgow for many years. It is known to all Glasgow solicitors. The Lords Advocate's position was published in the <i>Law Society Journal</i>—perhaps the hon. Member does not have time to read the <i>Law Society Journal</i>—and I look forward to using it. I shall look with the greatest of care at the accounts which are sent in by the hon. Members firm in summary cases, to see whether they precognosce and get a fee for precognoscing the two policemen who speak to the caution and charge, or whether they lift the telephone and ask what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0574">Image</span>

the answer is. That is exactly what we want solicitors to do, and I hope that the hon. Member will encourage all solicitors to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it a serious proposition that the hon. and learned Gentleman will personally examine a particular firm's accounts in this way?<br><br>
Secondly, is he saying that if I phone the fiscal's office and ask for information about the Crown case that I shall get full statements about what a witness will say? Even if I do, I would have thought that there was still a case for going to check it. As he rightly said earlier—when agreeing the Thomson report and rejecting the earlier discussions about giving the Crown precognitions to the defence—the defence in any event would have to go to check on the strength and what was actually said.</span></p>

PROCEDURE WHERE ACCUSED DESIRES TO PLEAD GUILTY UNDER SOLEMN PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 15, line 15, after "agent", insert "through his own procurator".<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. This will not only give any hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) time to recover his composure, but it will help me too, because I must confess that I was reading something else of interest to me and was not paying too much attention to what the Solicitor-General was saying. That is not a mark of disrespect.<br><br>
I understand that the Solicitor-General has given an undertaking to the Committee that he will personally examine the ac-</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
<p>It sounded almost like a threat, if I may say so. I want to know if the Solicitor-General means that seriously in cold blood. I know that he likes the flowery phrase, the extravagant and dramatic gesture. I want to know what I am dealing with.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is dealing with is that there is an opportunity for all solicitors to find out the strength of the case, to save a great deal of public money by so doing and to be in a position early on to get their clients to plead, and I trust that they will do so.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 5.</p>
<p>counts of Ross Harper and Murphy. I am sure that he would want to withdraw that.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it will shorten matters, I certainly withdraw that. But it was the hon. Gentleman's firm with which the experiment was originally conducted. I am surprised that he does not know that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the matter is resolved we can move to amendment No. 66.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted by the withdrawal of the Solicitor-General.<br><br>
May I now also bring balm to the soul of the Under-Secretary of State by telling him that this will be the briefest of debates? The amendment is a probing one. I refer the Committee to section 102 of the 1975 Act—"Accelerated Trial". It will be seen that the phrase, which I am trying to write in, appears there. It states:—
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the accused shall give written notice to the Crown Agent through his own procurator that he desires".</p></blockquote>
I want to find out why the phrase "through his own procurator" has been deliberately
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
omitted. Does it mean that a section 102 letter will be signed by the accused alone and not by his agent, or will it be optional? I can make it as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be optional. At present an accused cannot sign a section 102 letter and that does not prevent his repudiation of such a letter when it has been signed by his agent. Theoretically, it is not repudiable at that stage, but that has not prevented a person from repudiating a section 102 letter signed by his solicitor. Therefore we feel that he should be able to sign it.<br><br>
The Thomson committee proposed that all such letters should be signed by the client, presumably to prevent repudiation. We believe that that would be too cumbersome and harsh. There is also the person who does not have a procurator. To include the words "through his own procurator" would put at a disadvantage anyone who was not so represented.<br><br>
Therefore, it will be optional and we feel that that is the most reasonable and humane way of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General will know the problem, which often arises, when a client, either without legal advice, or sometimes with legal advice, decides to plead guilty so as to hasten matters, avoid publicity and so on. Often the retention of legal advice will dissuade him from that action. The solicitor may say "You have a perfectly good case and, in your own interests, I strongly advise you to plead not guilty and go ahead with it." Often, if it is left to a client's own option, he will plead guilty, although it is against his own interest to do so.<br><br>
I can see the point that is being made, but there are another two ways out of it. One is that the letter should be signed both by the client and by his agent. The other is to include the words "signed by his agent". In most cases, on petition, the person will have an agent because of legal aid.<br><br>
I believe that these alternatives might be considered before Report. Either signature by both the client and his agent, or the provision of "either-or" which ensures that if it is an "either-or" situation the person is aware that he perhaps should consult his lawyer, if a lawyer exists, before he does so. I prefer the first alternative of double signatures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
would be cumbersome to have both signing it. A person might ring up and say "Would you plead guilty?" To have him come into the office to sign a letter would be an imposition, I think. There are circumstances, such as the hon. Gentleman adumbrated, in which the solicitor might say, "That is not my advice, but if you wish to tender one, I suggest you sign it." That means that, thereafter, there can be no question of him coming back and saying "You put it in and I did not want you to do so."<br><br>
Therefore, there are circumstances in which both would be applicable and I should prefer to leave them as alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That answer seems, on the whole, perfectly satisfactory. The amendment was a brief probing amendment. I am delighted to know that there is still an option and that either the procurator or the accused may sign. However, I am still not clear whether the Solicitor-General was suggesting that if the accused himself signs he will not then be able to repudiate the tender. If that were so, there might be certain consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter of law. We shall wait for the test case. I should have thought that a person who signed himself would be in a much more difficult position. The signature of a plea is regarded as a final act. I think that has been so in any cases I have known. I think that it is statute law that once the plea is signed, that is final.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are under pressure, and I do not want to prolong this discussion, but the point is very interesting. I have had clients who have repudiated a section 102 letter at the section 102 diet. That can be extremely aggravating for the court and for the solicitor, but it has always been accepted to my knowledge by the court, grumpily and reluctantly. The diet would be discharged and a new indictment served and ultimately the trial would go ahead.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General rightly said that the signature of the solicitor, presumably authorised by his client, was in effect the signature of the client. I should have thought that in theory that would be considered not to be so only if there had been fraud or a serious misapprehension by the solicitor.<br><br>
I do not want to encourage people to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
take back a plea tender under section 102 but I should like to think that, if we are leaving it optional who signs the tender, the signatures should be on the same basis. I think we should maintain the present position whereby a change of plea is accepted by the courts.<br><br>
I do not want to tempt a long debate out of this question. Perhaps the Solicitor-General could consider the matter and send me a note if there is anything he can tell me about it.<br><br>
If the accused signs the tender himself because he does not have a procurator, there may be better grounds than normal for allowing him to take it back. He may take legal advice and discover that he has a good defence. It would be unfortunate if taking the option of signing himself, perhaps without having taken legal advice, resulted in the accused being bound to the plea, while someone who says over the phone to his procurator "Go ahead and sign it, mate" can retract it.<br><br>
Perhaps the point is self-evident. It is a point of some substance, and I shall leave it with the Solicitor-General. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

FAILURE OF ACCUSED TO ATTEND DIET IN SUMMARY PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 16, line 3, leave out from beginning to "an" in line 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 52, in page 16, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that no complaint shall be raised under this section if the accused has been held in contempt (as a result of his failure to attend any such diet) under any power which the court may have to deal with contempt of court".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment need not detain us long, although it could do so. These are amendments to a clause of which I basically approve and which I welcome. I understand that the effect of the clause is to remove the possibility of double jeopardy. The new subsection (2) reads:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to any power which the court may have to deal with the accused for contempt, an accused who without reasonable excuse fails to attend"</p></blockquote>
may be due on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 and a period of imprisonment.<br><br>
What appears to be envisaged in the clause—not just to the lay reader but to a solicitor as well—is the situation where the sheriff may say "I do you for contempt—to the cells with you, and come up again next week" or "I fine you £50 on the spot" or whatever sheriffs may be given to saying in choleric moments.<br><br>
If the sheriff's indigestion persists, he may then also instruct the fiscal that he wishes a prosecution to be taken. I know that the fiscal has discretion, but it would be a brave fiscal—particularly in the case of a strong sheriff and a small court—who would not take the nod from the Bench. Someone who had been done for contempt in this way might then be pursued with summary complaint and further fined. I may be misinterpreting the possibility but if it is at all on the cards, even as a rare event, we should exclude it. These amendments are designed to do so.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the clause is drafted, there is a possibility of double jeopardy. It is not intended that that should be so. If the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment, I shall attempt to draft an amendment that excludes the possibility of double jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Say it again and again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Always withdraw if you are brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there is a lesson there for our times. With great pleasure, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DESERTION OF TRIAL DIET</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 16, line 30, leave out subsection 1.<br><br>

We are now in the private and abstruse world of <i>simpliciter</i> and <i>pro loco et tempore.</i> I shall ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland to explain. I thought the law was that if an indictment or complaint was deserted <i>simpliciter,</i> it could not be re-raised, and that the matter was stone dead for ever, but that if it was deserted by the Crown <i>pro loco et tempore</i> it could be re-raised. That was a nice, simple and clear distinction.<br><br>
I am not entirely clear about the effect of clause 18. There is some discussion in Thomson about this matter which has further confused me.<br><br>
I tabled these as probing amendments to give the Solicitor-General for Scotland an opportunity—if only in a few words—to confirm my understanding of the law, and say that it will continue despite these changes. I shall be happy to leave the matter there. There is some doubt and I thought it was worth at least giving the matter an airing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for raising this matter, as it is an important clarification.<br><br>
The question of desertion <i>simpliciter</i> as opposed to desertion <i>pro loco et tempore</i> is, indeed, as he stated it. It had been thought that in Scottish law until 1976 the motion by the procurator-fiscal could be made at any time until the first witness was sworn. The difficulty arose in 1976 in the case of Handley v. Pirie in which the accused had not had served on him a section 10 notice of the alcohol content in his blood seven days before the trial. The procurator-fiscal waited until the accused pled. If he had pled guilty it would not have mattered, but he pled not guilty. It was upheld in Handley v. Pirie that by that time it was too late to move for desertion <i>pro loco et tempore</i> in order to serve the certificate and have a new diet.<br><br>
That case reduced the time in which he could move his motion. All this provision does is restore the position so that, just as in solemn proceedings the trial begins when the jury is sworn, in summary proceedings the trial begins when the first witness is sworn. It merely gives an opportunity for the fiscal to make this motion after he has heard that the plea is one of not guilty.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As so often happens, there was more than we thought. I speak only personally. Other hon. Members may want to say something on the matter, now I have started the hare running. However, I do not think that I shall pursue it this morning. Perhaps we shall return to this matter on Report if, on reflection, it appears to be of substance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be all right so long as my hon. Friend does not desert it <i>pro loco et tempore,</i> or vice versa, as the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or vice versa, yes. I am obliged to my hon. Friend, who has put it very well. This is a matter of some importance. I genuinely see the argument that a clerical omission in, for example, the serving of a certificate of blood alcohol level in a section 6 case means that the person concerned gets away with no prosecution at all. On the other hand, I think that it was to some extent a self-inflicted wound, and possibly the fiscal should have moved to desert <i>pro loco</i> before the plea was recorded, in which case we should not have been bothered in this way. It is a matter for argument and perhaps also for consideration whether there are wider implications, which, frankly, however facile I try to be, I cannot fully consider on my feet.<br><br>
You might note, Mr. Gourlay, that we are abandoning this amendment, as my hon. Friends say, <i>ex proprio motu</i> and <i>pro loco et tempore</i> and definitely not <i>simpliciter</i> at this stage. Perhaps we shall be glad to leave it there, but we leave it on the understanding that some of us will at least consider the position. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the Bill has been so severely criticised for what is sometimes seen as the erosion of civil liberties in the law of Scotland that this clause should not be allowed to pass without a welcome and without emphasis on the addition that it gives to civil liberties of the individual in Scotland. It is worth complimenting my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General because in the previous Criminal Justice Bill he attempted to introduce this clause, but the previous Lord Advocate resisted it. I am bound to say that he had some respectable legal authority on his side for doing so, and he also had the support, in his resistance, of the Scottish Law Commission.<br><br>
Nevertheless, this clause is an extremely worthwhile innovation in the law of Scotland. We have had considerable discussion of fundamental rights and principles such as the right to remain silent. But, surely, in the criminal law of Scotland, the most fundamental principle is that the Crown has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Without such a provision there is the danger that the Crown will prove its case by the inexperience or incompetence of the legal adviser who might say that there was no case to answer. Under the existing law if he took that step and failed, his client would not have the opportunity to go into the witness box and give his own case. On the other hand, if he should have argued that there was no case to answer and failed to do so by allowing his own client to go into the box, he might provide that evidence which would complete the case for the Crown. It is desirable for the defence to be given the opportunity at the end of the Crown case to say that there is no case to answer.<br><br>
Those members of the Committee who may not be aware of the historical context of the proposal may be attracted to it if I mention that it is a fundamental reform in the law of Scotland inasmuch as, for the first time, it means that the Lord Advocate is no longer wholly master of the instance to the point when he concludes his speech to the jury. It will now mean that at an earlier stage a judge or a sheriff could effectively withdraw part or all of the charge from the jury. I hope that some members of the Committee will welcome the clause, if for no other reason than that.<br><br>
The role of lawyers in Scottish courts has been under discussion this morning, but I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
consider this to be a worthwhile provision, particularly as it will provide a safeguard for those accused before the courts against the activity of their lawyers who might otherwise be incompetent or experienced. I should have thought that, with this provision there would be a greater opportunity. As all members of the Committee considering the previous Bill with legal experience mentioned, there is no more agonising decision—I think that those were the words used—that anyone has to take than whether they will attempt to put forward a case of "no case to answer" or to go forward and put their client into the box.<br><br>
What my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General said in debates on the previous Bill has often been quoted in our debates in an attempt to embarrass him. With reference to existing law he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is an appalling and obscene blot on the law that this rule exists. I can see no reason for it."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 March 1979; c. 673.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. and learned Friend has been utterly consistent in this view, and I congratulate him for ensuring that this provision has been introduced into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That quotation from the Solicitor-General's usual restrained style does him credit. It may be something of a defensive bid before we come to trial in absence. Some of us have already been reading the Solicitor-General's description—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same one, as I recall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very much the same adjectives but in a different combination and an infinitely worse cause.<br><br>
Because I have been a persistent critic, may I also say that I warmly welcome the clause? It will reduce the strain and the incidence of cardiac arrest among those who practise their trade in the courts. It is appalling to know that if one's client goes into the box he may be taking considerable risks, but that, if one keeps him out of the box, one's submission about sufficiency of evidence may go down, and then he is precluded from putting forward what in his mind is, and in truth may well be, a good defence. It is not a case of solicitors, the accused or anyone else benefiting from this change; justice benefits. It will ensure that, if there is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
sufficient evidence, that submission can be made and, if one loses, one can properly present the defence case.<br><br>
I remember arguing by analogy in the last debate that that situation arose in perhaps a rather lowly part of court life—children's panel proofs. But there one could make a submission; if one were rebutted, one could continue to put one's client into the witness box and lead the defence case as one would have done if no submission had been made. Therefore—I hope that this is not too undignified a way of putting it—we are bringing practice in the big courts into line with existing practice under children's panel proof rules.<br><br>
I very much welcome the new clause. I only ask the Solicitor-General—if it is he who will reply—what subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) means. I do not quite understand what circumstances it covers and why we cannot have subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time, I am about to disturb the Committee's unity. As a layman, I am naturally suspicious whenever I hear lawyers agreeing. I am not saying that the "no case to answer" proposal is not a good one, but it is right and proper that we should probe a bit further how this new procedure will operate, what the effect will be and particularly how the Solicitor-General, who, after all is said and done, is the second-line prosecutor in Scotland, sees this new procedure working.<br><br>
I do not share the enthusiasm for the belief that the provision will be that much of an advantage to an accused person—it may be a great advantage to those defending the accused person—but I think that I can be persuaded. I shall hear what the Solicitor-General for Scotland says before I make up my mind.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) made an interesting point. The trial may reach the stage where the charge on the indictment is at the point where the prosecution has finished its evidence. We are always told that legal representatives accept and act on their client's instructions and there might be cases where the advice based on those instructions to the accused person will be not to go for a "no case to answer" hearing, but to continue with the trial. Nevertheless, the accused person has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
the right to instruct defence to submit a "no case to answer" plea either to the judge or to the sheriff.<br><br>
I do not take that case in isolation. The position would be that the sheriff would hear the "no case to answer" plea in the absence of the jury. We are speaking of a trial half of which has taken place in the presence of the jury. The defence then decides that it should submit to the sheriff that there is no case to answer. The sheriff or judge hears that plea in the absence of the jury.<br><br>
It is the next stage that worries me. We come back to court. The judge or sheriff may decide that there is no case to answer. That would be fine if it was as far as the matter went. But the sheriff or judge may decide that there is a case to answer. There is an immediate change in the position. At the end of the half-way stage in the trial, the prosecution having led its evidence and the defence having sought a plea before the sheriff or judge that there is no case to answer, and the jury having listened to all that evidence—the jury will not be unaware that the defence has made a plea of no case to answer—the judge or sheriff then comes back and says "But there is a case to answer". The jury must be influenced by that decision. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am not at all sure that it happens in that case to the extent provided for in the new provision. If it happens now to the extent that it is provided for in the new provision, why on earth is this new provision in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must realise that what happens now is that not only do the jury know that such a plea was put forward by the defence and rejected by the judge, but that by then it is too late for the defence to put forward any evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that. I assumed that what the Minister was saying was that the whole procedure happens now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then what are we doing with this clause in the Bill? What does it change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may have a genuine confusion. I think if he terminated his remarks I could clarify the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that at present, at the end of the Crown case, the defence, whether the accused is represented legally or not, can make a submission to the Bench that there is insufficient—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it this way. My understanding is that at the end of the Crown case, the defence can make a submission that there is insufficient evidence. If that is upheld, obviously, that is the end of the trial. If it is not upheld, as the law presently stands, there is no possibility of the accused going into the box or any defence evidence being made. One can, of course, go to the jury and say "Do not believe the Crown case", but one cannot put forward any positive defence.<br><br>
The welcome change proposed in this clause is that the defence can now say at the end of the Crown case that there is insufficient evidence. That is argued before the judge outwith the presence of the jury. If the judge then says "No, I disagree with you; I think there is sufficient evidence to prove it"—whether the jury will accept the case as validly proved is another matter—and says that there is at least a prima facie case which must go to the jury, instead of going to the jury immediately with speeches and no evidence one can continue to lead the client, put him in the box and lead any other relevant defence. One is not, therefore, going for broke with the submission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I allowed my hon. Friend to intervene. The Solicitor-General indicated that my hon. Friend is wrong. It is clear that there is a great deal of misunderstanding, particularly in the legal profession, about how this new provision will work. If the legal profession does not understand it, how on earth can other people be expected to understand it? However, I leave that until I hear what the Solicitor-General has to say.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 962</span>
Another point I am anxious to establish with the Solicitor-General relates to multiple charges—a number of offences on the same indictment. As I understand it—the Solicitor-General will correct me if I am wrong—the defence would have the option to plead on one or more of the offences that there was no case to answer, but that would not affect the remaining charges on the indictment. I believe I have that correct. What effect would that have on any subsequent charges which are not on the original indictment before the court considering the case?<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General could deal with those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had no case to answer until the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) spoke. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) for his kind remarks. It is a pleasure to
<br><blockquote><p>"do good by stealth and blush to find it fame."</p></blockquote>
May I say, without disturbing the unanimity of the Committee, that, in my opinion, there is an infinitely more fundamental objection than when we are talking about the right to silence? But there have been no objections. We have had nothing from the organisations representing civil liberties or human rights, yet it happens daily in the courts. I am always suspicious of the frenetic objections and upholding of the right to silence by those organisations when one of the fundamental wrongs has never been complained of.<br><br>
I am, therefore, happy to be associated, as one of its principal parents, with this reform. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), who passed me a note, succinctly put it: the present law is that if it is held that one has a case to answer, one is not allowed to answer it. That is the absurdity of the position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) put the law to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth correctly, with one exception. It was laid down in the case of Kent v. Her Majesty's Advocate that no submission that there was insufficient evidence could be made until the Crown had addressed the jury. A practice has crept in, <i>pace</i> Kent, for the convenience of saving time and so on, that it was more sensible to make the submission.<br><br>
If I may correct the Committee, this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
is not a submission that there is no case to answer. It is inviting the judge to direct the jury to find the accused not guilty of the offence. He cannot withdraw the indictment. My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus is wrong. The Lord Advocate remains the master of the instance and, in theory, could proceed despite the indication from the Bench that it intended to advise the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. The indictment has been remitted to the jury and it cannot be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a small point, but we seem to be in great difficulty with our friends, the rubric writers, again. The rubric against the clause says "no case to answer". We did not get to the bottom of the fascinating constitutional conundrum of who is responsible for that when it was raised the other day. No doubt the Solicitor-General has been delving in the books and he or someone may be able to give us the answer.<br><br>
However, would he add this piece of rubric to those that need fundamental revision in view of the debates that we have had?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall consider that. I can now authoritatively tell the hon. Member that it is those who draft the Bill who write the rubric. But we should not get the law wrong.<br><br>
Counsel often says "My Lord, I submit that there is no case to answer!" What is meant is "I invite your Lordship to direct the jury to find the accused not guilty."<br><br>
I have always thought that it was a fundamental wrong that when, as in a classic case such as Her Majesty's Advocate v. Ellis, which was a capital murder charge, a submission was made to the jury that there was no case to answer. That meant that the special defence could not be put forward and that the accused could not give evidence. I believe that this is one of the most libertarian reforms to be made to the law of Scotland for a long time. I should like that message to go out from the Committee from those who have said that there were attacks on the right of silence. The compulsion to silence that this made has been removed for good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be only right, proper and unchurlish of me to respond to that. Of course we welcome any provision here which gives a man a double option—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
an option to seek trial or an option to make a submission that there is no case to answer, and therefore an acquittal, but to proceed with defence thereafter. We welcome it unreservedly.<br><br>
I wish that the Solicitor-General would also unreservedly welcome the demands on other aspects of civil liberties put forward by those whom he criticises so heartily and rhetorically. It seems a strange way of gaining credit for his love of civil liberties for the Solicitor-General to attack all those who quest unceasingly for the improvement of civil liberties.<br><br>
It is not true that this matter has never been raised. It has been raised with me personally. I do not know whether it is in any of the briefings by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties or anywhere else, but it is a matter that has concerned those of us who have been closely associated with aspects of civil liberties.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General would help his case and get our support far more if he would stop these frenetic attacks. He is no longer an eccentric on Princes Street. He is a Minister representing Scottish law in the House. It is not helpful that those who have shared his apparent desire to achieve civil liberties should be rejected as allies in other cases.<br><br>
Perhaps we might now see a reversal—no case to answer—on the clause on search, which we discussed so briefly on Tuesday. He may withdraw that on Report, too, and we would welcome him to the ranks even more wholeheartedly.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been an agreement among all of us—I do not mean specifically, but a general agreement—that we want to make progress, when we can. But, when we come to matters of real importance, we should stop and consider. Of the likely part of the Bill that we will be travelling across during the course of today, at least this is certainly one of the most important matters.<br><br>
It deals with a startling provision—that it should be a right of a court, if there has been misconduct on the part of the accused, to proceed with the trial in the absence of the accused. As the Committee will remember—I say this with no particular pleasure—it was in the Labour Government's Bill which fell with the general
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
election. On that occasion, it was a subject of extremely lively debate in which, not for the only time, there were some unlikely allies.<br><br>
I was extremely happy then to be able to vote with the Solicitor-General, the Under-Secretary of State and his colleagues, and I was joined by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael). As a result of that—</span></p>
