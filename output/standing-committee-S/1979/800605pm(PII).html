<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from col. 1024]</p>
<p>8.19 p.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Cassandra once said, "As I was saying when I was interrupted …"—I began my remarks by paying tribute to the fact that we had the <i>Daily Express</i>the day after it was published and advising all the Scottish newspapers that if they wanted to get to Scottish Members on time in future, it would be a good idea to use my old industry, the Post Office.<br><br>
I turn from that to the press campaign launched against clause 22. As I said earlier, I am not anxious to inject any heat into the debate. I want to argue as reasonably as I possibly can that in this case the Government have got it right. I issue a challenge tonight to the editors of the Scottish press. If they feel so strongly about this issue that they must adopt the tactics to which the Committee has been subjected, I for one would be prepared to debate with any or all of them publicly.<br><br>
It would be a great mistake if anyone in the Committee believed that in modern Scotland the influence of the press was very great. I honestly believe that people in Scotland are now so politically mature, and mature in every other way, that they make their own minds up about issues. I do not argue that the press can influence any particular issue one way or another. Indeed, in all the great issues of the day, when the press is on one side, the people normally come out on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Devolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not think of a better example. I am here not to argue that the press exerts any great influence on public opinion but to argue the influence that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
press could have in relation to the future of young lives. They would be injured beyond repair if some of the publicity took place which is likely to take place if we increase the freedom of the press to publish the kinds of detail which Dorothy-Grace Elder wants to publish. I shall come to her article later in my remarks.<br><br>
That must not be taken as an indication that I intend to speak for long; it does not. But I have fond memories of Dorothy-Grace. I remember her in this very room, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, in the days of the <i>Scottish Daily News</i> and the <i>Scottish Daily Express.</i> I have fond memories of the honourable lady who represents the <i>Daily Express</i> in this debate.<br><br>
But the examples that Dorothy-Grace Elder has chosen are probably the worst that any journalist could choose to justify his or her case that clause 22 ought to be removed from the Bill. In her article she talks about the gunman who burst into a school in Dundee some years ago and shot a school teacher. She complains that it should have been possible to photograph the youngsters who were witnesses in the subsequent trial. She says they should have been "pictured".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is shaking his head, but Dorothy-Grace Elder says that it should have been possible to picture these youngsters, obviously so that they could appear in the paper. That is the worst possible example, because the gunman who burst into the school in Dundee and shot the teacher before the very eyes of the pupils in subsequent years committed the most heinous crime that Scotland has seen for the last 50 or 60 years.<br><br>
The Committee must ask itself whether the photographing and publishing of pictures of those youngsters would have put them at risk. My argument is that in the case that Dorothy-Grace Elder has chosen—she has chosen it, not I—had those youngsters' photographs appeared in the press, the youngsters would have been at risk. All members of the Committee know the case to which I refer, where a person burst into a Dundee school and shot the teacher. Subsequently, that person escaped from an institution and committed the most heinous crime that Scotland has seen for a number of years.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0617">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
We want to protect youngsters from such events, and Dorothy-Grace Elder has chosen probably the worst of all possible examples. She says that even if a school teacher steals the school trip money, the holiday fund money, the school would not be identified and the public would not know.<br><br>
I take the example of one of my favourite Sunday runs—Blairgowrie. If a teacher in Blairgowrie ran away with the holiday fund belonging to 80 pupils, with their 80 mums and dads, and probably another 120 brothers and sisters, who will pretend that the public would not know about that incident?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Blairgowrie, where it matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, in Blairgowrie where it matters.<br><br>
The other important issue, to which no member of the Committee has addressed himself, is the right of a youngster to a chance of rehabilitation after he has committed an offence. I know that court case headlines are very attractive. But after the person concerned has been sentenced there is a continuing problem, and not many headlines appear about that.<br><br>
We are all inclined from time to time to reminisce. When I was Under-Secretary I had some responsibility for prisons, and I shall never forget one of the first youngsters I met in one of our young offenders' institutions. I shall not, of course, name the youngster and shall do my best to avoid any possibility of him being identified. The young man had been involved in fight when he was 14 years old. The other combatant had fallen, his head hit the kerb and he died. The young man was charged with a very serious offence and he was sentenced to be detained at an HMP centre during Her Majesty's pleasure. By the time I met the young man he was 21 or 22 years old.<br><br>
I know that this example is exceptional, but I want all our youngsters to have a chance to be rehabilitated. That young man had taken up a sport. Because he responded so well to what is described as treatment—I do not know why it is described as treatment in a young offenders' institution—in the young offenders' regime he had been taken through the various heats of a certain sport throughout Scotland, and subsequently the United Kingdom. He became the United
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
Kingdom champion at the sport he had taken up. I am careful not to say which sport, because he would be easily identified.<br><br>
When I visited the young offenders' institution, I was extremely impressed with the array of trophies in the visitors' room. I persuaded the governor to take the trophies from the visitors' room and put them in the young man's cell, on the basis that it was not the visitors who had won the trophies but the young man himself. The governor had the decency and good grace to contact me at a later stage and tell me that every morning of the week the young man would get up an hour before he had to so that he could polish his trophies. He was proud of his achievement in life and that it was being recognised in such a way. They were his trophies and he had won them.<br><br>
8.30 p.m.<br><br>
The end of the story is interesting. Subsequently, this young man was selected to represent the United Kingdom at the Commonwealth Games in Toronto. I was the Minister responsible at that time. We had to say then that, while the young man could be escorted throughout various parts of the United Kingdom to take part in the various heats of the sport that he had taken up, we could not contemplate the idea of his going to Toronto to represent the United Kingdom in the Commonwealth Games. I should have liked to say that he could go, because I believe that he was worthy of going.<br><br>
I took a decision that the young man should not be transferred to the adult prison, because I did not believe that he would benefit from being put beside adult prisoners. He was released about 3½ years ago. He now lives in another part of Scotland. He did not return to his home environment. To the best of my knowledge, he lives with a Salvation Army family and runs a youth club, teaching children in the same sport in which he became so expert.<br><br>
I recount that case to show that anyone who believes that none of our youngsters will respond to the kind of treatment in borstals or young offenders' institutions does not understand either the system or the success rate. While I have taken what is probably an extreme example, I know from my own experience that there are a number of less spectacular examples where youngsters have taken the opportunity and responded to the treatment.<br><br>
If, at the time of his conviction, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
young man had had his name plastered all over the newspapers—that would have been done; make no mistake about it— there would have been no chance that he would be accepted back into society. Therefore, while we are discussing the freedom of the press to report these cases, we are also discussing the right of a youngster to have a chance to rehabilitate himself or herself in society. No one can afford to turn his back on that latter vital issue.<br><br>
I come now to the kind of case which the press would choose to publicise. I have never sought to convince people of my honesty or motives. This is not to be seen as an attack on the press. It is a plea for people to see reason on this issue. We have to ask ourselves what kind of case the press would choose to highlight.<br><br>
It has been argued by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) that the incidence of crime involving youngsters is increasing. I accept that argument. The 1978 Crime Statistics bear that out. I believe I am right in saying that table 48 of those statistics shows that 267 crimes in every 1,000 are committed by a youngster under 17 years of age. If that is so, and if column-inches are so short, the media themselves will be selective in the cases that they choose to publicise.<br><br>
Whatever the media say, their choice will not be based on the right of the public to know. I remember the hon. and learned Member, now the Solicitor-General for Scotland, talking about Johnny Smith who lived at 44 Glebe Street in some mysterious city. That will not be the choice. The choice will not be about the right of the public to know. The choice will be about the case that people most want to read about. The choice will be about the case—we all know the score—that looks most appealing from a sales point of view on the hoardings.<br><br>
As we go out of the Palace of Westminster every night we see the hoardings. The newsmen are expert at choosing the headline that they know we want to read.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Jim must go."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always know when the tourist season starts in London. Every time I buy a paper from the vendors outside when the tourist season starts, I get short change. They seem to think that MPs are like tourists. When I get short change I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
know that the tourist season has started.<br><br>
But the point is that on those hoardings are the headlines that the publishers know will most attract people to buy their paper. It will be on that basis that the press itself selects. It cannot possibly publish all the cases. The press selects the kind of case that it wants to publicise.<br><br>
We have all been fairly light-hearted in this debate, but it is not a light-hearted matter. It is very serious.<br><br>
The plea in the <i>Daily Express</i> is that there is a difference between Scotland and England. Why should there not be? I am astonished that the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) allowed himself to be trapped in the argument that the position in Scotland should be same as that in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the right hon. Member said in yesterday's <i>Daily Record.</i> I have no objection to the position in Scotland, particularly in relation to Scottish law, being different from that in England and Wales.<br><br>
I have already explained the case of the young man. I do not believe that it is unique. There are many youngsters who take the chance to rehabilitate themselves back into society. That chance would be denied them if the kind of publicity were allowed to be given to such youngsters that is being argued should be given to them.<br><br>
The case in Dundee is the worst possible example that the <i>Daily Express</i> could have taken to prosecute its own case. I have dealt already with the influence of the press particularly on the attitude of people to those youngsters. I know one or two people prominent in the sporting world. There is a well known professional footballer in Scotland. I do not know whether his club knows his early involvement in crime, but I strongly suspect that if the club knew through the sort of publicity that would have been given that young man would not have had the chance that he has at the moment.<br><br>
I appeal to the Minister and the Committee not to yield on this issue. There is no reason for the Minister to yield on it, and Government Back Benchers should rethink their position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The weakness of the hon. Gentleman's arguments is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1031</span>
in both the cases which he has mentioned the youngsters have had their identities covered under the status quo.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I cannot understand for the life of me why advocates of all people treat this matter with so much levity. I accept that these young people have had their identity covered under the status quo. That is why I argue that the status quo has been so successful that it ought to be extended in the way that the Government have suggested. If I were not convinced that the status quo had been successful, or if I were convinced for a minute that it had done damage and had not protected the type of person that I have described in my argument, I should have been in favour of looking at the matter again.<br><br>
The press itself cannot argue that the status quo has not been successful. It has. That is one of the main arguments for extending it. It is not an argument for restricting it. I am surprised at the right hon. Gentleman putting that point.<br><br>
I rest my case with an appeal to the Government not to allow themselves to be bulldozed. I am no different from anyone else—we are all inclined now and again to be persuaded by press and media comment. But I plead with Government Members not to allow themselves to be bulldozed on this of all issues. It will damage children, not help them. It will not protect society, and will do nothing at all to rehabilitate youngsters. I ask the Minister to stand firm on this point, because if the issue is that this clause should not stand part I tell him now that I shall advise my hon. Friends to vote in favour of the clause standing part. If the Government Back Benchers want to vote against the clause standing part of the Bill, that is a matter for them to square with their own consciences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has been right to emphasise that the major consideration before the Committee is the position of offenders under the age of 16. Here we are dealing—as we are not in the rest of the Bill—with a particular group of offenders. We are dealing with those who are by definition juveniles—under the age of 16—and therefore that group which is the least likely to have embarked on a course of serious crime.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1032</span>
When we are dealing with adult offenders we know to our misfortune that for the most part the serious adult offender tends to have a whole string of previous convictions. Unfortunately it is often the case that they have embarked on a life of crime and the prospect of rehabilitation has been small—to say the least—in most of these cases.<br><br>
Here we are dealing with youngsters under the age of 16, and for the most part it is wrong to assume that rehabilitation is out of the question, or indeed even unlikely for many of them. That is the context in which we should look at clause 22. We should also take into account the fact that in so far as clause 22 as drafted would impose restrictions on the press, these are only restrictions in relation to the actual name of the offender.<br><br>
It would be wrong, as certain press articles have sought to suggest, that somehow there would be a prohibition on reporting the facts of a criminal case, just because a juvenile was involved. All the facts of the crime—the horror and terrible nature of it, where it took place, and many of the other details which the public would be entitled to be aware of—can be reported under the provision so long as they do not disclose the identity of the youngsters involved. That is another general point which I want to make at this stage, because it puts the whole matter in perspective.<br><br>
I was pleased that my hon. Friends took the view that whatever the law is, it is right that solemn and summary jurisdiction should be brought into line one with the other. There is no argument in logic why prohibitions that exist in relation to one form of offence should not exist in relation to the other. I am glad that there is total unanimity on that point.<br><br>
I suspect that there is also unanimity on one other point, although it was not raised during the debate. It is important because it does not exist at the moment. The prohibitions, such as they are, do not apply simply to children who have been convicted of a crime: they also apply to children who have been charged and whose trial is progressing but who may, at the end of the day, be acquitted.<br><br>
8.45 p.m.<br><br>
I think that I can say that the Committee would be unanimous in the view that it would be wrong that a child who, at the end of the day, might be acquitted and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1033</span>
found not to be guilty of the perhaps very serious crime with which he was charged, should in the interim run the risk of having his identity splashed across the newspapers and the media and thereafter always be known as the child who was charged with murder and, no doubt in the minds of many people, was lucky to get away with it. That is another factor covered in the clause but which does not apply at present in the law and where there would be unanimity that the law ought to be reformed at the very least to ensure that all youngsters who have not even been convicted of a crime but merely charged with one should not have their identity revealed in the course of the trial when it is not known whether a guilty verdict would be returned.<br><br>
Another area of importance is the fact that we are dealing not only with children charged and convicted of crimes but with children who are witnesses in a trial. We have to subdivide to make the debate meaningful. There are two kinds of child witness. There is the child witness who is the victim of the person accused, whether it is incest, rape, interference or a serious assault. It is often thought to be very much in the interests of that child that his or her identity should not be revealed, not only because it may be embarrassing, but because the fact of knowing that identity will be published may dissuade people from coming forward in the first place. That is another important consideration that the Committee will want to bear in mind.<br><br>
There is a second kind of child witness—the witness who is only incidental to the crime and who just happens to see something. The child might be walking along Sauchiehall Street when he sees a man running out of a bank. He may, therefore, be able to give important evidence in the trial as to that man's identity. It might be a child who has seen a road traffic accident and who could identify the registration number of the car. This category covers a child who has not been involved either as a victim or as the accused but happens to be an important, or a vital, witness. I do not see any compelling reason in terms of public policy why there should be an assumption from the beginning that that child's identity should never be revealed.<br><br>
There may be cases when the court would consider it inappropriate even in these circumstances to reveal the identity of the child, but I think that there is a strong case for saying that, whatever we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
think about other matters, the onus should be against publication in the case of a child who is neither the accused nor named in the charge but who is intimately involved with the crime or the offence committed. The Government's amendments would have taken that matter into account.<br><br>
Clause 22 provides that in solemn as well as in summary jurisdiction, as is the case at present, a child who has been convicted of an offence should, in normal circumstances, not have his identity published. But there is a qualification to that: it is unless the court decides otherwise. My hon. Friends are right to point out, as the press has done, that it is all very well to give the court the right to use its discretion, but who will remind the court of that right and who will put the point to the court so that the court can consider whether, in the particular circumstances of a crime, it might be desirable and in the public interest that publication be released?<br><br>
I accept that there is no specific provision in the clause that relates to that matter, but I can give the Committee some information that will greatly reassure my hon. Friends and may be perfectly acceptable to the Opposition as well. It is the intention of the Crown Office to issue a standing instruction to all advocates depute and fiscals that at the end of a trial which has involved children which in normal circumstances would not give the press an opportunity to publish the identity of the children, the court should be reminded by the depute or fiscal that it has the discretion to allow publication if the court believes it to be in the public interest. Therefore, in all cases it will be drawn to the attention of the court that this is not an absolute prohibition but a discretionary matter that the court is entitled to overrule if it is satisfied that, in the circumstances of the case, there would be no reason why publication should not be permitted. That is a substantial change on the existing practice.<br><br>
Under existing practices, as my hon. Friends will be aware, unless the court remembers the discretion or unless it happens to be mentioned by accident during the course of submissions to the court, the possibility may not arise and the opportunity may be lost.<br><br>
There is also a specific provision in the clause that, even if the court has not permitted publication, if there are circumstances which suggest to the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0621">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
of State that publication in the public interest would be appropriate he may so require, and that would then take place. These are important safeguards but I accept that those who are concerned with principle may not feel that they are sufficient or satisfactory.<br><br>
I was asked what contact the Government had had with the press to find out its views and to discuss the matter with it. I had a useful and fruitful meeting with a number of Scottish editors in their representative body. We had a very full discussion of all the points raised and they have also submitted their views in writing to the Government.<br><br>
I invite the Committee to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill because I believe that, even if one has reservations about some of the detailed aspects of it, some substantial reform of the law is absolutely necessary, for a number of reasons that I have mentioned—first, to bring solemn and summary jurisdiction into line with one another; secondly, to allow for an accused who is not yet convicted—at the moment publication can take place in solemn cases; thirdly, in the light of the Crown Office instruction which I have indicated will operate in future.<br><br>
I also accept that it would be right and proper, in view of the strong observations that have been made by some of my hon. Friends, that the Government should, before Report, give serious thought to whether a further amendment might not be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has mentioned his meeting with the editors. Great play has been made in the last few days of representations against this clause. I think that I am right in saying that the clause was also in the Labour Government's Bill. I am led to believe that it was not a Thomson committee recommendation, which makes it an attractive proposition to me. But it did not come out of the blue and, therefore, it must have been put in by the Labour Government and by the present Government because of previous substantial representations from all the various interests that are concerned with the care of children. Would the Minister agree that, although those representations were made some time ago and are not recent, vociferous and powerful, like the press representations, they should be taken account of and not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
ignored?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have mentioned earlier that the Crown Office has had, over the years, quite a number of protests and representations both from parents and sometimes from Members of Parliament in respect usually of children who are witnesses and where the publication of whose identity has not only caused embarrassment but sometimes has led to a disinclination to come forward to give important evidence in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend confirm that one of those representations came from myself to the Crown Office as far back as July 1979? That, therefore, gives the lie to some of the wilder allegations from Opposition Members that Conservative Back Benchers have suddenly addressed their minds to the problem purely because of a press campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point 100 per cent. Indeed, the press has come in for some harsh words during the course of this debate. But I want to make one point abundantly clear. Although representations to Members have taken place only during the last few days, the press expressed strong concern to the Government months ago. We have had meetings with the press on this point over the last few months to try to allay some of its fears and to take on board some of its points. It would be wrong to say that the press suddenly thought of this problem a few days ago and then contacted hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister, then, not surprised, following the comment that has just been made by his hon. Friend, that a whole number of amendments have not been tabled to this clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. Whoever is responsible for putting down Back Bench amendments it is not I. I cannot be expected to comment on that. I am aware of the great legitimate concern, shared not only by the press but my hon. Friends and people outwith the Committee. I have indicated that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister not agree that the press concern that has been expressed to him has not only been about this clause? There is a general press

concern in Scotland about the inability to publish photographs relating to court cases. It is unfortunate that this one issue has been taken out of that whole matter. Our whole argument is that while there may be concern about adults, there ought not to be any concern about youngsters under 16. I hope we do not continue to confuse both issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take on board a good deal of what the hon. Gentleman has said. It is certainly the case that the present restrictions regarding summary jurisdiction have not had any of the alarming and horrifying consequences that certain newspapers have suggested these proposals will have in the years to come.<br><br>
I have indicated that the Government will look closely at the points that have been made over the weeks to come. In particular I have indicated that, regarding child witnesses who are not intimately involved in the actual crime, the onus should be in favour of publication unless the court, in a particular case, decrees otherwise. We shall have an opportunity to discuss that at a later stage if an amendment is tabled.<br><br>
I hope that with that assurance my hon. Friends will feel able to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill at this stage. We shall have a further opportunity either to consider any Government amendments or to discuss any further specific improvements to the clause that anyone might wish to make at that time.</span></p>

PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE OF JURORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 20, line 33, leave out 'one' and insert 'three'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
amendment No. 48, in page 20, line 36 leave out 'one' and insert 'three'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a narrow point. I was very concerned when I saw that the number of peremptory challenges to juries was being reduced from five to one, although I realise the Government's concern about the dangers that exist and have existed in the past where it has been possible theoretically, and sometimes in practice, to squint juries by a use of the peremptory challenge where there are more than one counsel and one client involved. I remember a case where six clients were involved and there were five challenges each. They were all used up—30 challenges. While I appreciate that danger, there are dangers in reducing it as much as is suggested in the provisions of the clause.<br><br>
The basic danger is that the use of the peremptory challenge is a flexible mechanism for excluding from a jury people who are obviously unsuitable for that particular case in the view of the defence. It is a quick way of doing it. It is done without embarrassment to the juror himself. If this is removed—and coming down to one does remove it—the danger is that conscientious solicitors will go through the jury list, check up on those who appear on it, and in order to achieve the balance necessary on a jury, and to correct what comes out of the bottle from which the clerk of the court draws the numbers, they will rely on objections to jurors on cause shown. I believe that to be invidious for the following reasons.<br><br>
First, it could be a cause of great embarrassment to jurors who are not there of their own volition. They are brought to the court because they are cited to appear. Secondly, it will undoubtedly be expensive.<br><br>
I have not attacked solicitors for charging too great fees, as have others in Committee. But a certain amount of the legal aid bill that will be put in for solicitors if the clause goes through will be for the work that they will have to do, and will if they are conscientious, in order to check up on jurors to find a cause to show to the court if needed.<br><br>
9.0 p.m.<br><br>
I believe that the Government should seek a compromise. They should accept that the present system provides too many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1039</span>
peremptory challenges and is, therefore, open to abuse. They should also accept that the clause at present provides too few peremptory challenges and will cause problems on the other side. Therefore, they should go for three jurors.<br><br>
Someone said to me recently that there will not be many objections to jurors on cause shown because the judges will make sure that that does not happen and will not allow the system to be abused. I hope that the Government do not listen to that argument because there can be nothing so certain in the law than that, if a judge were to say to a counsel or solicitor that he had had too many objections to jurors on cause shown and that he was not allowing him any more there would be the quickest cast-iron appeal to a following conviction that I can think of.<br><br>
For those reasons, I ask the Government seriously to consider my amendment. I hope that they will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will know that I and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary have very strong feelings about the fact that the number of jurors who can be peremptorily challenged at the moment leads to the defence being able to indulge in buccaneer jury vetting. I do not think that that is right.<br><br>
Many representations have been made to me over the past few months and I appreciate that, if we reduce the number too far, people may be able to justify at least the argument of a challenge, even if it is not successful, on the basis of cause shown, which, thankfully, in the law of Scotland, is almost non-existent. They might be able to promote it as a habit. That is something that I would very much deplore.<br><br>
I am persuaded, while being continually hostile to the concept of what I would call buccaneer jury vetting—I do not want to jump out of the Scylla into the Charybdis and therefore into a situation that is equally time-wasting and abominable— that the compromise is one which the Government can accept. Therefore, I accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Solicitor-General's generous concession. I am astounded at his generosity. It is a complete surprise. However, the compromise seems to be very reasonable. Five
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
challenges was too many. From some recent figures which I obtained from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, it seems that in a place such as Glasgow far too many people were being required to attend for jury service because they might be peremptorily excluded. But I think that the reduction from five to three will mean that the number of people cited for jury service who then do not serve, will be reduced to a reasonable minimum, and that is an acceptable compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Government on accepting the amendment. We were under the impression that we had tabled the amendment first, but the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) jumped the gun.<br><br>
Looking at the Second Reading debate, I am most impressed by the way in which, once again, the Solicitor-General has changed his mind. On Second Reading he was firm on this point and did not give any indication that he could be persuaded to increase the number of peremptory challenges from one, as proposed in the Bill, to three.<br><br>
I congratulate the Solicitor-General's Back Benchers. They should try it more often. They are most gracious when they do so. It is not painful. I am sure that the Solicitor-General's shoulder blades are not all that sore. They should try it more often.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I, too, was under the impression, as were my hon.

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only assume that the Clerk to the Committee has dealt with the matter in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House. I accept the Notice Paper as it is before us.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that time is pressing, although it should not be on matters of this importance. We have deliberately made the debate short, but a reduction from five to three is not much better than a reduction from five to one.<br><br>
I wish to make clear that we are distressed, and opposed to this change. We should prefer the law to remain as it is. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will be interested to know that the change which has been introduced by the Government, and which we are opposing, was recommended by Lord Thomson's committee. It is also o some interest, as the Committee will remember, that paragraph 51.30 of that committee's report has in it the pregnant sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"The overwhelming view of our witnesses who submitted evidence on this issue was in favour of the rentention of the peremptory challenge".</p></blockquote>
Judging from my experience of the legal view, I think that the word "overwhelming" is an accurately chosen qualification. I do not think that anyone who practises in the courts likes the idea of the number being reduced.<br><br>
I accept the Solicitor-General's argument that, in a sense, the peremptory challenge could be used to vet a jury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is indicating that he has used it. I have used it. In the last jury trial in which I took part as a principal—as the agent appearing—I remember that I used all my five peremptory challenges and still had nine women and six men in the end. I calculated that if I had had one—I have not done it for three—I would have had 13 women and two men in the end. I make no bones about it that I think there are cases when, from the point of view of the whole system, it is not bad to have a balance in terms of sexes on a jury.<br><br>
I concede that I have rigged a jury. I make no secret of that. If my client was accused of armed robbery in a bookie's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
shop and No. 15 on the jury list was the manager of a bookmaker's shop, I should be likely to challenge him by using one of my peremptory challenges on the ground that he would be likely to be heavily biased.<br><br>
To give a personal example—one which will appeal, I think, to the Solicitor-General if he finds himself in private practice again, when on the Opposition Benches—on the rare occasions when I appear in a jury trial I always make a point of objecting by way of peremptory challenge to any juror who is a constituent of mine, on the ground that my appearance would almost certainly hopelessly prejudice him or her against my client's case. That is perfectly fair.<br><br>
Therefore, I accept that it is a form of vetting. But it is a harmless form of vetting. By and large, I believe that it is an advantage to the system. The worry is that if it is removed we shall encourage a more positive form of vetting which will become harmful. We would end up with many attempts to show why someone should not serve, which would be argued before the sheriff or before the High Court judge.<br><br>
I have taken the trouble to refer to Member v. Her Majesty's Advocate, which was a case heard in the High Court of Justiciary on 19 October 1973. A reference from the Solicitor-General drew my attention to it. The counsel for the applicant was Fairbairn QC. The agent was J. Baltrami. It was the old firm in operation, which has recently become familiar in the world of literature. The Solicitor-General's case references tend to be autobiographical, but I do not necessarily complain about that.<br><br>
I have carefully read Lord Justice General Emslie's remarks on what constitutes a peremptory challenge and what constitutes cause shown. It is interesting that he makes clear that he takes an extremely sceptical view of cause shown but does so, I deduce from reading his judgment, because he knows that there are peremptory challenges. He states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Apart from peremptory challenges special cause must be shown."</p></blockquote>
He then gives a very restrictive view of what is a special cause. My fear is that because of the reduction in the number of peremptory challenges, if more agents are tempted to try and argue cause shown the judges will start taking a more generous and less restrictive view, and instead of the entirely innocent and, at times, helpful criteria which I believe motivate peremp-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1043</span>
tory challenges at present we may end up with something similar to positive jury vetting.<br><br>
I accept what the Solicitor-General said, that it is not rigging; that is far too pejoric a way of doing it—an innocent form of managing a jury. But it is a form which is allowed at present in law and is a bulwark against any possibility of future abuse.<br><br>
I agree that it is a matter of balance. I am grateful that we have carried Conservative Bank Benchers with us some way—perhaps not to the vote, for that would be going too far—and have got the one raised to three. However, I strongly feel that it should be five. I should like to have extended my argument to some extent but I hope that I have made clear why I think this way and that, even at this late date, the Minister will agree to withdraw the clause.<br><br>
The argument that it will save many people the inconvenience of jury service is totally unsound. It will not make one whit of difference in that respect. I shall be interested to have an estimate from the Solicitor-General of what percentage reduction he expects in the number of people summoned for jury service in Glasgow.<br><br>
The Tomson recommendation, apart from the fact that it was in the face of the overwhelming opinion of all those who gave evidence, was also on a completely different basis. Lord Thomson said that we should cut down the number of peremptory challenges, and cut down the size of the jury, too. We have not, rightly, cut the size of the jury from 15. But the peremptory challenge reduction was part of that package and the argument, therefore, was totally different.<br><br>
For all those reasons, sketched in with indecent haste, I hope that the Government will with good grace, which they are capable of, withdraw this rather silly and retrograde step, and that we shall not have to divide the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, hope that the clause will be rejected. I have read the Thomson report diligently and I cannot basically find any argument that Thomson adduces for it. He winds up in paragraph 51.31:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our real object however is to minimise the capricious or tactical challenge."</p></blockquote>
He does not show in what way the practice of the peremptory challenge has in that sense been tactical or capricious in a way
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1044</span>
that merits condemnation. It is a tactical challenge—of which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow & Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has given an example—in the sense that, as was suggested, a banker might be better kept off a fraud charge, especially if he were an honest banker. But that would be rare. It would be usual to try to get some kind of balance.<br><br>
For example, I should have thought that it would be most embarrassing for a Member of Parliament representing, as many of our solicitors do in English seats, constituents who appeared in front of them in a case. That might be a reason for a peremptory challenge. That kind of reason cannot be condemned as capricious or tactical. He would be right to object in those circumstances. The sex balance and class balance are all important. We cannot regard that as either capricious or a tactical challenge. Therefore the basic argument goes.<br><br>
9.15 p.m.<br><br>
Thomson recommended two, but he did so along with other changes, including the dropping of the jury to 12. The truth is that if we were to drop the number of possibilities of peremptory challenge we would increase the possibilities of cause shown challenges. This, apparently, has rarely happended in Scotland. Indeed, it is so rare that, as Thomson says:
<br><blockquote><p>"MacDonald on 'The Criminal Law of Scotland' (at page 283) lists the grounds for challenge as infamy, outlawry, insanity, deafness and dumbness, blindness, minority, enmity and relationship."</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely narrow group, and there is no doubt that pressure to extend it will be brought to bear. If that happens we are then moving down the road towards jury vetting.<br><br>
As I understand it, we have been given the assurance in Scotland—the Solicitor-General will confirm it—either by the Lord Advocate or by him, that we would resist jury vetting in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Lord Advocate gave the assurance, and I confirmed it in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I thought. I knew that the hon. and learned Gentleman was associated with it. There has been that assurance, so there is no pressure or desire for jury vetting on either side of the political spectrum or, on the whole, the legal spectrum. But there is no doubt that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1045</span>
if we move in this direction we must move towards the increasing use of the non-peremptory challenge, on cause shown, which immediately brings us into the realm of a move towards jury vetting. We are right to leave it as it is. I have heard no evidence to suggest that it has either been misused or has given rise to any major problems. Indeed, in paragraph 51.30 of Thomson we are told quite simply that the "overwhelming view" of witnesses was that it should be retained.<br><br>

INTERPRETATION OF 1975 ACT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 22, leave out lines 11 to 15.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment and may be disposed of quickly. Clause 25 deals with the definition of "officer of law". The amendment is put down to find out what is behind this redefinition. I picked it up—if I may put it that way—from the Law Society, which is a little puzzled.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to page 22. This seems clearly preliminary—this is the redefinition—to the introduction of a court service for the Crown and perhaps also for the defence, for citing persons to the criminal courts. The clause goes on to redefine a "probationer" and so on. I am not so worried about that. It never occurred to me that there was anything in the Government's mind preliminary to the introduction of a court service for citation which would be available to the defence. This is apparently something which is suspected by the Law Society. I should be interested to know if it is in the Government's mind. I put down this amendment to find out.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1046</span>
<p>who have been in touch with us on this issue, namely, the Council of the Law Society, the Faculty of Advocates, the Glasgow Bar Association and the associations concerned with civil liberties have opposed the change. It is a regressive step. The Bill would be better if the clause were withdrawn.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 7.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with this matter briefly. The hon. Member for Glasgow Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will know that the Thomson committee recommended that there should be a separate court citation service. There are considerable difficulties in the present procedure whereby so many persons may be asked to cite witnesses and so on, and the procedure is different in both solemn and summary procedure.<br><br>
It is our hope—although funds at present forbid it—that we should in time be able to have a court citation service, freeing those persons who presently have to carry out those time-consuming and tedious, but very necessary, services. In order to do so these redefinitions are are necessary to include categories of persons who are not at present—in either summary or solemn procedure—permitted to carry out those acts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this hour and under this pressure we cannot probe. It is an interesting idea and I had not been aware of it. I am glad to know that it is the Government's intention, whenever practicable, to introduce such a service. I am sure that the solicitors' profession will be glad to hear about it. It sounds like the removal of an administrative burden on them. We shall certainly watch with interest, and perhaps press occasionally to see how preparations are progressing.<br><br>

ROUTINE EVIDENCE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 22, line 24, leave out from beginning to end of line 7 on page 23.<br><br>
This ought to be a substantial debate on a substantial matter. Perhaps the best thing that I can do is introduce it at least briefly and then hear what the Minister has to say.<br><br>
“Routine evidence" is a nice innocent rubric but routine it is not—in my view. We should look sceptically at this, and if we are not reassured by some promises of changes, the Government should at least promise to look at the matter again before Report. We would also be looking at it again before Report with a view to action then, if at no other time.<br><br>
The clause lays down that in a number of areas of prosecution—particularly under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Social Security Act 1975 and the Child Benefit Act 1975—certain documents can be lodged in court and served on the defence and shall become evidence in their own right unless challenged.<br><br>
The Minister will no doubt try to reassure me. He has already mentioned to me, and I accept entirely, that there is no question of these documents being above challenged. It is perfectly clear from subsection (2) that not less than six days before the trial the accused can challenge their validity and that they then have to be proved in the normal way. For all that, there is a very considerable difference between what is now proposed and the law in its present state. At the moment the onus of proving the case falls fairly and squarely on the Crown. An onus is now being put on the defence to force the Crown to prove its case. The defence must take a positive action.<br><br>
Very often the opportunity may go by default. It is particularly likely to go by default in social security trials. In such cases people are often ashamed and are often tardy in taking legal advice. That is a feature of jobbing sheriff court practice. One often sees someone up on a social security fraud who is unrepresented. It is extremely unlikely that such a person will recognise the importance of lodging an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1048</span>
objection six days in advance of the trial. He may therefore find himself with a conviction which is not a proper conviction at all, since a document may well be the subject of an administrative mistake and in that case the case may not be provable.<br><br>
I can see no objection to such evidence being put in by document by positive agreement, but that is different from saying that it should be kept out by negative challenge. There is also a whole area of law here—of which the social security prosecutions for the most important part—where this routine evidence is not some necessary detail buttressing the main case for the prosecution but itself forms the prosecution's case. The documents can be absolutely central, and the proof that the payment was made—the proof that the person who is in the dock and whose name is on the documents is the person who got the weekly benefit payments, allegedly falsely—can be the whole essence of the case.<br><br>
If the evidence is put on the basis on which it is put by the clause, there will be a very serious tipping of the scales. The effect of amendment No. 185 is to take out a very large part of the clause and to remove this threat to one of the important principles of our judicial system—the principle that the onus is on the Crown to prove its case. That principle is fundamental. The whole framework depends upon that assumption.<br><br>
A man is innocent until he is proved guilty. A man can sit and wait until the case has been proved against him. This principle is eroded in areas where this documentation is the backbone of the Crown's case if the Crown does not need to bother to prove what is, in effect, its case, unless someone has enough nous, expertise, energy or intelligence to realise the significance of the documents and to force the Crown to prove the case by putting in a formal written challenge six days before the trial.<br><br>
I accept that the effect of this change would be that the number of convictions for social security frauds, for example, would rise very considerably. The conviction rate would go up. On many occasions I have seen prosecutions under the Social Security Act fall apart because it was impossible to prove the kind of documents which will now be put in and which, because of this rather complicated machinery, may not be timeously challenged.<br><br>
I regret that we do not have much time

to spare. I hope that some of my hon. Friends will find a few minutes in which to speak on this amendment. I am very suspicious of this clause, and I very much hope that the Minister, if he cannot immediately accept the amendment, will be prepared to look at it again before Report.</span></p>
<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, but we are dealing with a crucial matter. The part of the clause that we are proposing to delete is a large and crucial one.<br><br>
Under the heading and rubric of routine evidence, it is a most important and fundamental shift. The onus of proof is now being put on the defendant, and what defendants they are! They are dealing with social security problems and child benefits. Those who are likely to be in difficulty about this are the very people who are least able to cope even with correspondence. I sometimes wonder whether Ministers were even Members of Parliament at the same time.<br><br>
We meet the problem week after week in our surgeries. People who are in trouble are helpless because they cannot cope with papers or letters of this kind. I have had to open a whole group of letters which were in a woman's sideboard to tell her the reason for the position that she was in, in addition to trying to deal with evidence and sending letters. I know what happens. It does not even have to be a legal document: almost any kind of letter can panic many people.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), who is not on this Committee and should therefore not be concerned with these matters, is fond of seeing all abuses of the social security system as being due to intelligent scroungers. The intelligent people in our society rarely need to be scroungers. They can get jobs. They can more often be found in the professions.<br><br>
First, upon what kind of people are we imposing this new fundamental right of altering the onus of proof? I stress subsection (2) (<i>a</i>):
<br><blockquote><p>"unless a copy has been served on the accused not less than fourteen days before his trial".</p></blockquote>
That seems a useful safeguard. There is very little safeguard for the kind of person who will come under this provision.<br><br>
Secondly, paragraph (<i>b</i>) knocks sideways anything that might be saved under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1050</span>
paragraph (<i>a</i>). The schedule states that the certificate may be signed by:
<br><blockquote><p>"An officer authorised to do so by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Has anyone seen the rate of change in some of our social security offices? That is one of the main problems. Routine evidence will be handled by routine letter writers. The clerk on duty will sign it. Many of these matters go by default. The so-called routine evidence will be routine within the social security office, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will accept.<br><br>
I am not so concerned with the first two items in the schedule, the first regarding the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1976 and certificates signed by:
<br><blockquote><p>"Two police officers who have tested",</p></blockquote>
and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. They do not deal with the people with whom I am concerned. They come under the Social Security Act.<br><br>
The Child Benefit Act is also important. It is monstrous to think of the kind of people whom we are putting through this. The Supplementary Benefits Act often concerns older and disabled people. We cannot let this provision pass without discussion or opposition.<br><br>
If this clause is passed, where will it end? There is already an amendment down which we cannot debate extending to the immigration Acts. Any attempt to move this kind of routine evidence into such an area must be stopped. I was not responsible for any pressures of time upon the Committee. I have spoken less than most hon. Members. But on this issue, I make no apologies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously because of the agreement to conclude this part of the Bill by 10 o'clock, the Committee will forgive me if I am brief. However, I acknowledge the concern of Opposition Members.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will know, there are often trials where there are long lists of witnesses who have very little to say other than to give formal confirmation. Their evidence is never challenged. Nevertheless they spend a great deal of their time, at great cost and expense to all, in having formally to come to court, often waiting hours for their evidence to be required. They give that evidence in five seconds, and then leave the court. It is to deal with that practical problem that the clause and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1051</span>
schedule are put forward. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, where at any time it is known that these matters are in dispute, the defence may challenge them.<br><br>
I take the point of hon. Members that they are not concerned about the clause or the schedule in relation to some of the matters—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned with it all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but their particular concern is with regard to social security benefit and such matters. I reassure the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that even in this proposal there is no question of the Crown automatically being able to prove its case. The mere fact of this evidence being presented in writing does not prove the Crown's case; it is only one small adminicle in the Crown's case. It does not prove fraud or anything of that kind. It simply proves that the payments were made to the individual. It in no way indicates the circumstances in which they were paid or what claims were made by the individual.<br><br>
Opposition Members have expressed concern about what they feel could be the real prejudice to individuals under this provision. I am willing to undertake to look at the matter between now and report to see whether there is likely to be any prejudice. The Government do not wish there to be. They do not see this as a means of increasing convictions: let me make that abundantly clear. The proposal was not put forward with that intention; we do not believe that it will have that result and, if we thought that it did, that would be a very different matter. We are concerned only with getting rid of this great nuisance and irritation to hundreds of members of the public in official positions who spend hours in court waiting to give evidence for two seconds which is not challenged. That is the purpose.<br><br>
If, however, on reflection, we see that there may be jeopardy to individuals accused, we shall reconsider the need for the provision. I assure Opposition Members that that is not the Government's intention, nor do we believe that that will be the effect. If we feel that there is substance in what hon. Members have said, we shall take the necessary steps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1052</span>
point and one special plea to the Minister. It is not on the general case made by my hon. Friends but on the delivery of these documents and certificates by registered post or recorded delivery. I have grave reservations about that, because there is no guarantee with recorded delivery or registered post that the person for whom it is intended will receive it into his own hands. We all know that there are cases where registered post is brought by the postman and someone else signs for it. The Post Office is not concerned that the person whose name is on the envelope is the person who receives it. The Post Office is concerned only that it is shown that the envelope went to that address. I ask the Minister to look at that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased by what the Minister has said so far. When the Minister says that it cannot be used in evidence in relation to fraud—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say it could not be used in evidence. I said that it was one adminicle of evidence but that it did not prove the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That shows the difficulty when we make deals: we have to hurry. The Minister was making a point in relation to this merely being evidence that moneys were paid. The Minister must not think that that is unimportant. On the contrary, in relation to these matters it is crucial, if not the most important aspect of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Clearly, if the money was not paid, that is exactly the matter that would be known to the accused. When he or his solicitor received such a notification, he would obviously wish to challenge that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 186, in page 23, line 8, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
I believe that this amendment could be dealt with much on the same basis. I think that the Minister knows the arguments I could deploy as they have been deployed by a number of organisations. If he will guarantee to take the matter under the

CO-ACCUSED COMPETENT WITNESS FOR DEFENCE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a minefield that is full of interesting points, but the one that interests me with the clause, which I welcome on the whole, is that of the unrestricted right to cross-examine a co-accused. I think that might lead to certain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1054</span>
difficulties, and perhaps the Minister will give some thought to this matter in the weeks ahead.<br><br>
I foresee a situation in which an accused who has decided not to give evidence himself could, as I understand the Bill, if his co-accused decides to give evidence, cross-examine that co-accused while he was himself sheltering in silence and might attempt to shift the blame on to that co-accused or in some way prejudice a jury against him in his line of cross-examination. I just wonder—at this point I put this forward very tentatively—whether there should not be some provision that a co-accused should not have an unrestricted right of cross-examination if he is not going into the box himself.<br><br>
I can say this only in shorthand form, but perhaps the Minister will pick up my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point raised by the hon. Gentleman, which is very interesting. Clearly, there might be a sense of unfairness if a co-accused who was refusing to give evidence could, nevertheless, achieve the same effect by his cross-examination. I shall certainly look at the hon. Gentleman's point in the light of his comments to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the Minister about the clause. It may be because of my absence or, possibly, my dullness that matters are a little obscure to me. Incidentally, Mr. Gourlay, I noticed that while I was away people were referring very much ad lib to the Thomson committee recommendations, and this must stop.<br><br>
However, in all seriousness, will the Minister say whether the clause applies to a common law wife and, if not, why not? Will the Minister say whether the clause applies to the parties if they are separated but not divorced and, if not, why not?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1055</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision does not compel a spouse to give evidence, but merely permits her to do so. My understanding is that a common law spouse is not covered by the clause because he or she is not a spouse under the definition of the Act. If the parties are separated but still technically married, clearly, the person concerned is a spouse and would, therefore, come under the provisions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Minister's point about compellability, I welcome the fact that there is no compellability—that would be most unfortunate. Perhaps it was never the intention. My only point is that social circumstances change. While I believe in proper, legal marriages, a large number of people are involved in long-standing and settled relationships which have not been legally contracted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it is a voluntary matter, if they are not technically married, there is no need for it. It is the existing laws of evidence that affect spouses, but if a common law spouse is not a spouse, there is nothing in the existing law to prevent him or her giving evidence.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause. We should normally have a long-ranging debate on it. We are in difficulty.<br><br>
Although in a field of minor misdemeanour rather than of crime, the clause encroaches on corroboration in Scots law. Of course, I appreciate the strong administrative arguments in terms of expense and the efficiency of the warden
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1056</span>
service. However, I have severe reservations whether, on administrative grounds, it is justified in breaching the law of corroboration. That has been done in the civil courts in connection with certain categories of industrial injury, but to do it in the criminal law, even at the minor end of the range of offences, is dangerous. Perhaps the Minister could briefly comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can briefly comment. There is a precedent for this in the Road Traffic Acts. Under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, it is an offence for a driver to ignore the directions of a constable on duty. That is provable by one witness. The clause deals with similar road traffic matters, such as parking. It is the old problem of Scotland requiring two traffic wardens per parking meter, which is clearly nonsense in terms of normal responsibilities. For that reason, these limited matters are covered by clause 31.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know about the example. Another reason why we should have time to discuss these matters is that if we are too ignorant to find such examples for ourselves we can be told of them.<br><br>
I think it is a reprehensible step. I am told that the argument is one of cost. I should not like this Government to go down in history as the Government who threw away a deep-seated basis of law in Scotland in order to save a few pounds for the very rich, to whom they give tax handouts.<br><br>
Corroboration has been an important and valuable part of Scots law. I in fact changed it, but on one condition only. That was in relation to reparation cases. I thought long and deeply about it beforehand. I thought it was right and justified, and that it could be defended as an isolated application, inasmuch as it did not refer to criminal law. No-one would suffer. It enabled compensation to be paid to many people where there had been lack of corroboration of evidence, That was very different from lack of corroboration designed to be used against individuals. Therefore, even at that, I was chary about it.<br><br>
But this proposal is yet another step. I think it is reprehensible. The Government are on a bad course in most of this Bill, which is a bad Bill. I will not delay the Committee, but I think that the clause is wrong and should be removed. The Opposition will vote against it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. We have now moved with tremendous speed and everybody's good will. In the period we set ourselves we have covered 19 clauses and we have moved very quickly during the last half-hour. But the appeal procedure is a massive, major document. Despite the fact that the Minister has not reached the clause he wished to reach, I wonder whether he would consider pausing at this stage so that we can do the law of Scotland a little credit by paying attention to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. A very firm agreement was reached in this matter. The Opposition, including the hon.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1058</span>
<i>The Committee divided: Ayes 9, Noes 3.</i>
I welcome the general rebuilding of the appeals procedure. It is long overdue, particularly the appalling anomalies that existed in the stated case procedure. It is extremely valuable that they have largely been put right.<br><br>
May I take solemn and summary appeal procedures together and make just a few brief remarks? The most important aspect arises out of the change which allows a court to call for a retrial. I recognise that retrial has been successfully operated in England for a lengthy period. There is a strong case against it and I know that there is strong opposition to it—or at least anxiety about it—throughout the legal profession in Scotland.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General for Scotland, who I think is replying to the debate, will remember that under the new Section 228 of the 1975 Act, subsection (1) (<i>c</i>) says that there can be an appeal to the High Court in this case—it is the same in summary cases—
<br><blockquote><p>"against both such conviction and such sentence".</p></blockquote>
Among the things that can be done in settling that appeal is order a retrial.<br><br>
The difficulty about a retrial is that it is obviously a highly artificial situation in which witnesses are going through the panoply of examination-in-chief and cross-examination again. There is also a possibility that the second jury will be heavily prejudiced by all the press reports and publicity that we know from our earlier debates attend any murder trial in Scotland. There is a strong feeling among many involved in the trade that it would be better to deal with this not by retrial but by hearing any fresh evidence that there may be. It is contemplated in terms of section 228(2) where there is an alleged miscarriage because either evidence was not available or fresh evidence has come to hand. If those are the grounds for allowing the ordering of a retrial, it would surely be better just to hear the fresh evidence than to go through all the previous evidence. I can say no more about that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1059</span>
matter. I hope that the Government will give it consideration.<br><br>
I turn to new section 236A of the 1975 Act. I do not understand it. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as is reasonably practicable … the judge … shall furnish the Clerk of Justiciary with a report",</p></blockquote>
and, in subsection (2):
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the judge's report is not furnished … the High Court may call for such report".</p></blockquote>
What puzzles me is that surely a report is mandatory, because subsection (1) says "shall furnish", yet clearly that is wrong because, in subsection (2), <br><blockquote><p>"the High Court may call for"</p></blockquote>
it, and that is certainly naught but permissive. Presumably, on any layman's interpretation of that language, if the High Court did not exercise option 2, the report might never be furnished. That seems to me, at best, a confusion, and it should be made clear that the report will always be furnished.<br><br>
May I draw attention also to the case, which will be familiar to the Solicitor-General, of Ferguson, Petitioner, which appears in the <i>Scots Law Times</i> of 18 January 1980. In that case a man marked an appeal and was not granted legal aid and, as so often happens, the solicitor—I ought to declare an interest; it is a firm which is well known and with which I am, in fact, connected—found, as a service, a friendly counsel who was prepared to appear on the spot and give what advice he could. His advice was that there was no possible appeal. The man then said "Please abandon the appeal", but, because it was not in writing before the case was called, they were told that the appeal could not be abandoned. The High Court took its undoubted power of increasing what I remember to be a sentence of 18 months to one of four years.<br><br>
This brings up two matters under section 244. One is the question: when may one abandon an appeal? It is not clear from section 244 that the Ferguson situation could not recur. It is important that we make clear that an appeal may be abandoned at the calling in order to avoid such an unfortunate situation.<br><br>
Secondly, there is a strong case which perhaps Ministers should think about on Report. That is that we should abandon the High Court's right to increase sentences as it has done. It is anomalous. I know that it is a useful disincentive to appealing.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1060</span>
In the days of the previous Lord Justice General, appeals were almost outlawed. I am glad to say, in tribute to the present incumbent, that that is not the case today, but recently there have been examples such as that to which I have referred, and I believe that it would be better either to modify or to abolish that power.<br><br>
I have one further important point. There are many textual points about time limits and so on into which we ought to go, but there is one of real importance about which I feel strongly. That is, for example, in section 231, where the new wording begins:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to section 236B(2) of this Act, where a person desires to appeal …, he shall, within two weeks of the final determination of the proceedings…"</p></blockquote>
This applies to summary appeals also. Its effect is that, if one wishes to appeal against conviction, one cannot do so until one has been finally disposed of.<br><br>
In the summary courts in particular, if one is put, for example, on deferred sentence for a year—which is a common disposal—one cannot appeal against conviction until the end of the deferred sentence. It may be over a year later, and one must live with, possibly, a good appeal against conviction but be unable to lodge it. I believe strongly that one ought to be allowed to lodge an appeal against conviction only, as soon as the conviction has been recorded, and not have to wait until the final determination, which may be so long delayed.<br><br>
There are many other points, but I hope that these at least the Minister will consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The revised appeal procedures give immense benefit. The hon. Member has made certain points which may be valid, and I shall write to him about them.</span></p>

We must suspend for a Division until 10.15 p.m. The new Chairman will take over the Chair at 10.15, and I am afraid that he, too, will have to suspend the Committee at an early hour.</span></p>

Gourlay. Before our break I wanted to ask a question that I thought might be helpful. If the discussion of the Bill had not progressed as quickly as it had done and I had returned from wherever I was I had planned to put down an amendment on the appeals procedure. Clearly, that is not now possible.<br><br>
On Report, will the clauses concerning this area of consideration find more sympathetic consideration in respect of being called by Mr. Speaker? If so, the principles arising from the issue can be discussed on Report rather than other matters that we have covered in much more detail. If we were to receive such indication from you, Mr. Gourlay, or from the Government, I for one, and perhaps some of my hon. Friends, would feel a little more reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government, like other hon. Members, are in the hands of Mr. Speaker in respect of Report stage. I do not doubt that the hon. Gentleman's remarks will be noted and appropriate action taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to add something to what my hon. Friend said. It is worth pointing out that it was to schedule 2, which contains the detail of the appeals procedure, that the Government tabled a substantial number of amendments this morning and then agreed to withdraw them. So there is no doubt that there will be a major debate on schedule 2 when the Bill comes to Report stage because the Government are comitted to tabling a host of amendments.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, I propose to put the question on clauses 34 to 38.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I believe that, in fact, you were making a point of order procedure, Mr. Gourlay. At this stage I should say that I will leave rather than have any part in a babble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could put the questions separately. But if the Committee agrees, I shall put them together.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clauses 34 to 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned—[<i>Mr. Rifkind</i>]</p>
