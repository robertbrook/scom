LIABILITY OF VEHICLE LICENSEE AND HIS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 329, in
<br><blockquote><p>page 47, line 21, leave out "either by himself or by his employee or agent".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 330, in
<br><blockquote><p>page 47, line '22, leave out "and as the case may be, the employee or agent".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is in the nature of a probing amendment. There has been some discussion on the proxy situation in which people not themselves directly or contractually employed in a particular undertaking—it works both ways—may be held responsible for activities under clause 67, which relates to:
<br><blockquote><p>"Alcohol on vehicle travelling to or from sporting event".</p></blockquote>
The question arises as to the extent to which one can hold responsible a person who has merely been employed to turn up at 9 a.m. to drive the bus and has permitted alcohol to be carried on the vehicle. The holder of the licence may have gone through the proper negotiations and made it clear to the supporters' club that no alcohol must be carried. The employee then turns up at a garage, gets his duty bus, and alcohol is carried on the bus. He has taken no part in the discussions but when the alcohol is discovered, he is held responsible.<br><br>
This amendment is tabled so that the Minister can say whether this kind of proxy guilt should be in the clause. One can see that the drivers of these contracting firms merely turn up for duty at a particular time and take the appropriate bus— the duty bus, as it were—and have had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1422</span>
no means whatever of checking the contract, but because alcohol has been carried or smuggled on to the bus, he is then held responsible.<br><br>
There is a problem if, in the course of the journey, he discovers that alcohol is being carried. If he knew nothing of the operation of the law, but had a hunch that it was wrong, it would be very difficult for him as an isolated position with a bus full of football supporters to take actions which would exonerate him of the charge that alcohol was carried on the Vehicle.<br><br>
Consequent upon that, in line 23 it says that "the employee or agent shall be guilty of an offence". But the driver might be found guilty, although not responsible, and be subject to a fine of up to £200. We should try to clarify this matter to see whether this proxy relationship—in this case the bus driver—should apply.</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) seeks to delete the words "employee or agent". As he recognised, we are, for all practical purposes, talking about the driver of a coach or bus and what his responsibilities might be in the event of alcohol being carried.<br><br>
First, the offence is not an absolute offence. In other words, the driver is not automatically guilty of an offence simply by virtue of the fact of alcohol being carried on the coach. The offence only arises if the employee or agent:
<br><blockquote><p>"permits alcohol to be carried on the vehicle".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the question is as to the meaning and extent of the word "permits". If it can be shown that the employee or agent did not permit the carriage of alcohol, clearly there is no way in which he could be guilty of an offence under the provisions of the clause.<br><br>
We are dealing here with two practical possibilities, because if the driver was totally unaware of the carriage of alcohol, he could not, in any sense, be said to have permitted it. Therefore, there are two situations. First, where the driver becomes aware that alcohol is to be carried on the coach before the journey has begun; secondly, where during the journey, either while the vehicle is in motion or perhaps when it stops at a motorway service station, or some such place, he becomes aware that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0831">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1423</span>
alcohol is being carried on the coach.<br><br>
The question, therefore, is what obligation is reasonably to be imposed on the driver if he is not to be found guilty of an offence, having become aware of alcohol being on the coach.<br><br>
In that context, again we come to the significance of the defence offered in clause 69, that it is a defence if
<br><blockquote><p>"he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage."</p></blockquote>
If, therefore, a driver becomes aware that alcohol is being carried on the coach and seeks to persuade those responsible to remove that alcohol, and is not in a reasonable way able to ensure the removal of that alcohol from the coach, he could not be said to have permitted it if the alcohol remains on the coach. If, by a normal request or intervention—without the need for physical force or other matters of such kind—the driver could have occasioned the removal of the alcohol, but has failed to do so, it would clearly be a case where he had permitted the alcohol to be carried.<br><br>
The way in which the courts have in the past interpreted the word "permit" means that it would only arise where the driver could have meaningfully refused permission. Where he could meaningfully refuse permission but failed to do so, he would be guilty of an offence, but if that was not the circumstance, he would be perfectly able to say that he had not permitted the alcohol to be carried and, therefore, the offence would not have been committed by him.<br><br>
That is the background. It does not provide an absolute obligation on a driver. He is not automatically guilty of an offence by virtue of alcohol being on the vehicle. Only if these requirements of the clause had not been complied with would that position arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister could say a word or two more about that, as it is an important area. In a sense, it takes us inevitably—and I apologise for this—into the problems of the meaning of clause 69. They are really inter-related. It is important because this is the clause that puts the driver at risk.<br><br>
I have received no representations, but I do not know the views of the organisations representing the drivers who are likely to be involved. It may be that the Transport and General Workers' Union, for example,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1424</span>
has made representations to the Minister. I know that initially there were some fears about confusion and difficulties for its members, and it would help the Committee if the Minister could say a word or two about the view of the TGWU on the matter, and whether it made energetic representations on the basis of the power or responsibility of the employee as laid down in clause 68.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman this information. It does not relate to the union, but we received representations from the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport when the Bill was first published. It was opposed to the provisions as they then stood because it interpreted the provisions to mean that a driver would have to search persons coming on to the coach before he could be said to have met the requirements that would avoid prosecution.<br><br>
In the light of those representations and similar comments made in another place when the Bill was being considered there, the Bill was amended to provide the defence that is available under the clause as it now stands, and which considerably narrows the scope of any possible basis for prosecution compared with the Bill in its original form.<br><br>
It was not our intention that it should be so wide but we accepted that the representations that had been made had some force. Therefore, amendments were made in another place which now give the driver a considerable area of defence that would not previously have been available to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to get the matter clear, is the Minister saying that the TGWU made no representations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that there were no representations from any organisations representing drivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the TGWU knew that it had at least one stalwart representative on the Committee who, of course, waited to make his representations until the matter was discussed. In fact, there are two responsible representatives. One of them, the Whip, had to delegate to one his duty to make representations.<br><br>
The Minister has clarified matters a good deal. If he wrote to the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport on this matter, I should welcome a copy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0832">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1425</span>
of the letter. Also, a full outline of his points in the form of a letter would be useful, because the union will certainly wish to give guidance to its members on this matter.<br><br>
I take the Minister's point, but it is based on the practice of interpretation within the courts. I agree that that is a very firm practice, particularly in relation to the word "permits", which would be further defined in clause 69—which I take it, Mr. Gourlay, can be discussed in relation to this clause, because the words
<br><blockquote><p>"his consent or connivance and that he did all he reasonably could"</p></blockquote>
still depend upon a sheriff's interpretation. Would it be enough for the driver to say "When I discovered alcohol on the bus I asked the secretary of the organisation to remove it, he refused and I had no option but to continue the journey"? Would that be a complete defence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that it would. If the only ways in which the driver could have reacted would have been either to use physical force—which, clearly, would not be a reasonable way—or simply to refuse to move the vehicle, I think that that would be an adequate defence.<br><br>
If Parliament had wished to say that a driver must not move his vehicle unless satisfied that there were no alcohol, the clause would propose that and Parliament would be asked to approve it, but Parliament is not being asked to approve that. No such obligation is being imposed on drivers. All that is proposed is that if a driver could, in a reasonable way, have occasioned the removal of the alcohol but did not use that opportunity, he would have to accept the responsibility for not having done so.<br><br>
It is a question of common sense. If a driver finds alcohol on the bus, in many cases he might only have to say to the person concerned "Do you realise that you are committing an offence by having this alcohol here? I must ask you to take it out of the coach". Occasionally, the member of the public may not be aware of the law, or that this was a coach to which it applied, and be only too happy to comply with the driver's request. Therefore, it is right that there should be an obligation on the driver in a reasonable way to seek to have alcohol removed if he finds it on the coach. An obligation imposing an unreasonable requirement on the driver is not one that the clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1426</span>
proposes and is certainly not one that we would support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister is doing his best having regard to how the clause is designed. He will recognise why drivers are sensitive on this issue, because in any intervention, however mildly or moderately it is done, they are placed in jeopardy. Even a request couched in wild terms to the secretary of the group or one of the group on the coach may not evoke a resonable response. In a whole number of areas, such as in cities, drivers are placed in the greatest jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which is a fair one. I would be reasonably satisfied if a driver were able to show that the people in his coach were in such a bad humour, to put it politely, as to create a likelihood of violence towards him if he made such a request to them. In other words, if such were the unreasonableness of the response of the people on the coach that, clearly, any request from him would have been worth less than nothing, that would be a defence available to him.<br><br>
The question really is whether, on all the evidence available, it is likely that any reasonable request by the driver would have resulted in the alcohol being removed. The court would obviously want to look at all the evidence available, not simply at whether formal words were issued by the driver in question. It would depend on the circumstances.</span></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate my previous point. It would be useful if at some time we might see any representations and replies. If further thought could be given in regard to the union and to myself it would be useful. I agree that the legal argument put forward by the Minister is satisfactory, but I am concerned that in practice drivers might feel that they must attempt things that they should not attempt—and, indeed, all sheriffs might not take the same view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that a letter was sent to the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport, and I shall certainly send the hon. Gentleman a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would appreciate having that or any other information received in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0833">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1427</span>
the meantime, because I think that the union should be alerted on this, if only to guide the membership. It is dangerous when we move into the field of the proxy, the employer. It equally works the other way, if we remove the employee or agent on this, and the holder is responsible for something in which he is not directly involved. It is a difficult area.<br><br>
I am prepared to withdraw the amendment but I give warning that I might seek to return to this on Report, after we have read the words in HANSARD and seen the letters which are coming to us.<br><br>
In the meantime, it might be useful if the Department would give some thought to whether we can further secure what we are attempting to secure in the two clauses, while also having regard to the safety of the driver who, far too often in Britain, is placed in jeopardy because of the nature of certain passengers.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i></p>
<p>No. 271, in page 47, line 22, leave out "holder" and insert "operator".—[<i>Mr. Rifkind</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to probe the Minister's mind a little further on the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).<br><br>
Under clause 67, various conditions are laid on the person who hires the bus. We were debating this morning about secretaries of supporters' clubs, stewards and others. Would it be a proper defence or protection of the driver? Most, or all, of such buses are contract hires. Would it be in order for the company hiring out the buses to write into the contract that the organisation hiring the bus should be responsible?<br><br>
To take a practical example, if the Rangers' supporters club hired a bus from Parks of Hamilton, Parks of Hamilton could write into the contract that the Rangers' supporters club would have sole responsibility for ensuring that there was no liquor on that bus. Would that be in order as an adequate and proper protection for the driver? I think that there will be some real difficulties about protecting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1428</span>
the driver. I am anxious to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question would have to be "No". No contract between parties can supersede an obligation laid down by Parliament, and as Parliament would put an obligation on drivers, that could not be ignored simply because the parties involved have sought to propose otherwise. It may be that a company letting out coaches might make some private arrangement as to civil damages if, as a result of negligence by the hirer, offences were committed and fines had to be paid. That would be a separate issue. But a contract between two private parties cannot remove an obligation imposed by an Act of Parliament.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DEFENCES IN CONNECTION WITH CARRIAGE OF ALCOHOL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 332, in page 47, line 28, leave out from 'connivance' to the end of line 29.<br><br>
In a sense this follows on from the previous amendment. It deals with the phrase "without his consent or connivance" and then the additional words
<br><blockquote><p>"that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage".</p></blockquote>
I shall raise only one point. The clause states that
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be a defence for him to prove that the alcohol was carried on the vehicle without his consent or connivance and that he did all he reasonably could".</p></blockquote>
It may be possible to prove the first part— where the man says "I only turned up for duty at 8 a.m., there was the bus, I got on and I drove it." Plenty of people in the garage could prove that John Smith turned up at 8 a.m., signed on and took over the bus. But I am not sure that it will be so easy to prove that
<br><blockquote><p>"he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage"</p></blockquote>
if it were known that he was aware of it in the course of the journey. How is proof to be achieved if no one is willing to come forward, for example, to give corroboration? For the first part there might be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0834">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1429</span>
corroboration because there will be people who are in the office or the garage, but in the second part there is the implication of its being known after the event. I should be grateful for a comment on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in a debate that does not have a great deal of shape as we gallop through these clauses. But there is a point of real substance and importance here, and I hope that the Minister will give a careful glance at the amendment.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, it is an attempt to say that the statutory defence shall be established, if the driver— I believe that we are all particularly concerned about the driver—can establish
<br><blockquote><p>"that the alcohol was carried on the vehicle without his consent or connivance".</p></blockquote>
It should not be necessary, to establish a defence, to prove that he positively
<br><blockquote><p>"did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage".</p></blockquote>
That provision places an unnecessary additional burden on a driver in such cases. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the driver is friendly with the people on the bus, that he takes a can and they are all lads together, and it then gets out of hand and problems result. He is, as soon as he joins in, clearly committing an offence under the Bill.<br><br>
But it might be less than that. He might tacitly connive by making no verbal demonstration of any kind—no warning, no attempt to inhibit or discourage. I can see that it is reasonable for there to be a duty on a driver, but it seems to me that the reasonable duty is covered by the provision that he must establish that the drinking of alcohol on the bus was done
<br><blockquote><p>"without his consent or connivance".</p></blockquote>
If there is a positive provision, where it is not just a matter of "consent or connivance" but where the driver must positively establish that he took every reasonable precaution to prevent such carriage, the driver is in a position of considerable risk, doubt and confusion.<br><br>
The Minister will have read the debate in the other place. It was a fairly memorable debate. I heard it, because I went up to the Gallery to see how the other place was getting on with the measure. I remember that one piece of expertise advanced was that "Chaps often come to my banquets in buses". The noble Lord was able to give
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1430</span>
useful information on problems that might arise.<br><br>
There was also a fascinating debate—it sounds ludicrous now, but it underlines the difficulties into which intelligent men can easily stumble—about what constituted doing "all he reasonably could".<br><br>
One of the Under-Secretary's ministerial colleagues in the other place suggested that, if one were driving a bus and heard the clash of bottles in the back seat or bibulous singing, and it occurred to one that there was alcohol on the bus, it would be "reasonable" to pull into the first convenient lay-by or, as it was quaintly expressed, a neighbourhood milk bar— and there telephone the police.<br><br>
It was pointed out to the Minister, in no uncertain terms, that the unfortunate bus driver, pulling in at a neighbourhood milk bar and having to explain to his by then inebriated passengers that he was doing so in order to telephone the police, so that they could all be taken away and charged under part V of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, might put himself at considerable risk.<br><br>
No doubt the Minister will hasten to say to me that that is not the standard that he would expect, that the Minister in another place may have been carried away by enthusiasm or the memory of what happened at his banquets, and that that was an unreasonable standard to place on these words. I accept that that is so.<br><br>
However, there is a real problem. For example, if at the start of the journey, as the bus driver is watching his passengers boarding the bus, he sees six crates of Youngers being packed into the back of the bus, clearly it is possible to see that his duty is to say "Get those crates off the bus." Indeed, I should have thought that his duty would be to say "This bus doesn't move until those crates are taken off." I am sure that many hon. Members would take that view. That is a higher standard than the Minister suggested to be necessary, but I believe that many sheriffs would expect such a standard.<br><br>
It is much more difficult when there is no evidence at the beginning of a journey but later it becomes clear that a large variety of ingenious controlled containers have emerged from around the persons of those on the bus. The driver then has a problem.<br><br>
I believe that it is sufficient to say that the driver is not to be convicted if he in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0835">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1431</span>
no way connived—had no knowledge of the matter whatever. That seems to be a sufficiently high standard to lay upon the driver. We would encounter considerable difficulties by requiring him to act positively.<br><br>
In part V we are putting a considerable legal straitjacket on carrying people to designated sporting events, and to sporting events themselves. The provision would not be fatally weakened in any way and it would be much tidier—at least it would put drivers' minds at rest because they would know where they stood—if these words, which are bound to be open to varying interpretations from sheriff to sheriff and driver to driver, were merely removed. That would not strike at the central purpose of the Bill, but we would then have legislation which could be much more easily administered.<br><br>
Although the intentions of part V are admirable, and I think that we all sympathise with what the Minister is trying to do, some of us have doubts about whether it is workable. It is in this grey area of definition that the danger might arise. Therefore, in the interest of certainty—certainty in the administration of law is a most important concept—and without damaging the effectiveness of clauses 66 and 67, I invite the Minister to withdraw these words from the clause and leave the statutory defence only on the ground that the person has to establish that alcohol was carried without his consent or connivance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Nye Bevan once said, "This is a familiar echo from the past", because the amendment deals basically with the old rule of vicarious liability. In the days before the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, if a publican or, in particular, his servant sold drink to an under-aged person the publican—the licence holder—could be charged. There was no defence such as that in the clause. If I remember rightly, there is a similar defence in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976.<br><br>
Before I turn to the main burden of my brief remarks, I wish to pursue the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about the sheriff demanding the standard that a driver should maintain—that the coach would not move if there was drink on it. I take that stage further and, here and now, offer that as advice to my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1432</span>
friends in the Transport and General Workers' Union. They would be well advised to issue instructions to all their members that if a driver found drink on a coach and had difficulty getting it removed, he should not move the coach until that drink had been taken away. I share my hon. Friend's view that that will be the standard demanded by the sheriffs. Therefore, it would be wise for the Transport and General Workers' Union to advise their members as I suggest.<br><br>
The clause and the amendment relate to two groups of people only. First, there is the person who hires the bus. We come back to the secretary of the supporters' club. Clause 67(<i>b</i>) relates to the hirer of the vehicle. As I understand it, it does not relate to the owner of the vehicle but to those persons covered by clause 67(<i>b</i>) and clause 68—the hirer of the vehicle and the driver of the vehicle.<br><br>
5.0 p.m.<br><br>
I am strongly of the opinion that we ought to go along the road mapped out by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and stop at the word "connivance". Short of the driver saying "This bus shall move no further", it would be very difficult to define what he reasonably could do to prevent carriage of liquor on the bus. There would be a host of different interpretations of what was reasonable in the courts in different areas of Scotland. No consistent pattern would emerge as to what was reasonable action on the part of a driver when he found that there was drink on the bus when there should not be.<br><br>
The safest course would be to accept the advice given by my hon. Friend and remove these words. Hon. Members who are involved in trade union matters should make it clear to the Transport and General Workers' Union that, for its own protection, it would be well advised to instruct all its drivers in writing that they should not move any coach that would put them at risk under the provisions of clauses 67, 68 and 69.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the points made. I agree that the wording of the clause is of major importance in determining the responsibility that a hirer or driver might be under.<br><br>
I should have thought that there was a difference between what would be likely to be the obligation of a driver at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0836">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1433</span>
beginning of a journey if he knew that alcohol was on the coach—when there would be a greater likelihood that he would be expected not to begin the journey until the alcohol had been removed—compared with the situation where, during the course of the journey, it might become apparent that alcohol was being carried.<br><br>
The original obligation in the Bill when it was in another place was exactly the same as section 92 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. Then, to satisfy the court, the defence that had to be available to a person charged was that, first, the carriage of alcohol was without the accused's knowledge and, secondly, that the accused "exercised all due diligence" to prevent such carriage. That was a very high standard, but that is the standard in the 1976 Act. As a result of representations, amendments were made in another place which have produced the clause in its present form. That very much strengthens the position of an accused person.<br><br>
Amendment No. 332 suggests that we should leave in the words
<br><blockquote><p>"without his consent or connivance"</p></blockquote>
but remove the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) raised the question of onus of proof, the balance of proof and the question of corroboration. The standard of proof required to establish a defence is the balance of probabilities—not "beyond reasonable doubt". A much lesser standard is always required if a defence is being put forward.<br><br>
At this stage I am not certain whether corroboration would be required for this purpose. It may be that if the accused were considered a credible witness and he said what he believed to be the position, that would be sufficient. However, I shall be happy to look at that specific point in further detail to see whether corroboration would technically be necessary. Although I suspect that the courts would require only a very minor degree of corroboration if they believed that the accused was a credible witness, nevertheless, that might create problems that would be unfair to a driver if he were the only person on the coach available to give evidence, or to give it in a form sympathetic to him. I shall look at that point again, but I do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1434</span>
not think that the nature of the onus would be substantial.<br><br>
The most substantial point that has been made is whether it is desirable to leave in the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage."</p></blockquote>
The first point I put to hon. Members is that even if these words were to be deleted, it would not necessarily meet the points that they have raised. If we left in the clause the words
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be a defence for him to prove that the alcohol was carried … without his consent or connivance",</p></blockquote>
the obligation would still be on the accused to prove that. [<i>Interruption.</i>] With respect, although he may be seeking to prove a different thing, he may have to prove the same facts in order to prove it. In other words, if there were evidence available that he could quite easily have had the alcohol removed but did not do so, the only interpretation that the court might be willing to take would be that he did consent to the alcohol being carried.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that that concludes the argument. All I am saying is that the problem of an accused person having to show, on the facts available, that he did all that he reasonably could to prevent the alcohol being carried may not be dramatically or materially different from the problem of having to satisfy the court that he did not consent to the alcohol being carried at the time in question.<br><br>
At this stage I ask the Committee to approve the clause in its present form but I undertake to look at the wording between now and Report, to see whether, first, the removal of these words would have any material effect, either in the interests of the defence, or in the interests of the enforcement of this particular provision, and, secondly, to see whether the continued inclusion of these words would impose an unfair burden on a driver.<br><br>
The Government are anxious to obtain the right balance. It is not our intention or desire that drivers should have imposed upon them any unreasonable requirements that, first, would be unreasonable in theory and, secondly, would make it difficult in practice for a driver to know what was expected of him and how he should react.<br><br>
We think that the wording in its present form is fair. Therefore, at this stage, I ask the Committee to approve the clause in its present form, but on the clear under-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0837">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1435</span>
standing that I undertake to look again at the wording and to let the Committee know in time for Report whether it is the Government's intention to make any subsequent amendment to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very fair offer, and I am glad that the Minister has seized the burden of our argument. It is an important and crucial point. It is not a party point.<br><br>
I should like to comment on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). Despite what the Minister said, there is a difference between a driver having to prove that alcohol was carried with his consent and connivance and proving that he did all he reasonably could to prevent such carriage. It may be true that the same facts will be brought forward to establish this, but what they establish are two different things.<br><br>
The first proof is easier to establish in most circumstances. The second is fraught with all sorts of dangers. I have never known any bus, whether it was carrying supporters' clubs, Conservative Party associations or the Women's Rural Institute where some beer was not carried. I have never heard of coach parties in Scotland which did not carry beer. If I thought there were some I might have joined them. But it is extremely difficult for a bus driver, when there is good nature around—not necessarily aggro—to say, even when there is no trouble, "Get rid of the drink, or I am leaving you here at Bannockburn instead of going on to Dundee."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An unfortunate choice!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was deliberate. There were bogs at Bannockburn. That is what happened to the cavalry, and therefore that is an appropriate reason for dropping a coach party at Bannockburn. The burden of what the driver is being asked to prove is difficult. The whole concept of "nae beer on supporters' buses" is fraught with danger. There would have to be a revolution in Scotland before we had bus trips without beer. I cannot imagine that ever happening. But I am concerned about individual drivers, especially if there is a tightening up of the matter.<br><br>
The police may suddenly say "We have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1436</span>
been letting this Act slide. Everybody knows that it cannot really be carried out". They then tighten up a bit. The action takes place. The driver is caught and he is without any real guilt in the matter, but he is unable to prove that. We must reconsider the provisions although we cannot reconsider the whole clause or even this responsibility now. But if the Minister were to go so far as to make that separation or were to expand on the definition of the clause to safeguard the position of the driver, we might get somewhere.<br><br>
I make one final request—that the Minister will try to keep in touch with me or, if he wishes, consult the union to see whether we can come up with something that would be mutually acceptable, so that we can reach agreement on Report.<br><br>
Finally, I take the point that advice has to be given to the union members if this law is to apply, otherwise we shall have the position that exists in Glasgow, where at times the authorities have had to say "There will be no buses after 8.0 p.m. on housing estates."<br><br>
We do not want that to happen. I feel even more responsible than the Minister for not having dealt with this matter earlier. It is a crucial, non-party matter. I am glad that the Minister has replied and I hope that we get swift action before Report. I was on the point of pressing the matter to a Division but it would have been profitless for everybody. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 334, in clause 71, page 48, line 13, leave out "or both".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are self-evident in their intent. Clause 70 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any person who … is in possession of a controlled container … shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 60 days or to a fine not exceeding £200 or both."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0838">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1437</span>
I have an inbred dislike of "or both". The court has an option. It can send the person to prison, presumably, if his record justifies it or if there is something particularly serious about the offence, or it can decide that it is not a fit case for imprisonment and that it should fine him. But I do not see why it should have the option of imposing both penalties. It is to preclude that happening that the amendment has been tabled to omit the two words "or both".<br><br>
The same point arises under clause 71 and accounts for amendment No. 334.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to remove the words "or both". It is normal practice, where the alternative of a fine or imprisonment are the two options available to the courts, to provide also for circumstances where it is thought appropriate to enforce both. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), with his magisterial experience, clearly has had occasion to benefit from this option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only for that reason. New clause 9, tabled by my hon. Friend and myself, contains the words "or both". I am only being consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and one should never look consistency in the mouth. I am sure that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will agree that in the vast majority of Acts of Parliament which provide for penalties of both a fine and imprisonment, the option of imposing both is available to the court, and there is no particular reason why that should not be done in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never liked consistency as a virtue. It is a very uncomfortable habit and I have no intention of falling into the easy trap of promising to be consistent in the future. Nor am I very impressed by the argument that we have always added the words "or both" to allow both imprisonment and a fine. That may well be so. I have never bothered to consider the matter. But it is rare in my experience. I cannot remember ever having been in the court when a sheriff has both fined and imprisoned, for the simple reason that if a man is sent to prison it is extremely unlikely that he will be able to pay a fine.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
In an area such as this, which is quasi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1438</span>
criminal in a sense, this is what one might call a preventive strike by the criminal system. I do not object to the carrying of a "controlled container" being brought within the ambit of the criminal law, but it seems to me that this is an area where the court ought not to have its cake and eat it—or at least have the option of having its cake and eating it. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Or have a controlled container and drink it. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has helpfully supplied the apposite variation on the well-known cliché which sprang to my mind.<br><br>
But the point is more serious. I see no reason why the words "or both" should be here. I am not terribly impressed by the Minister's argument that the words "or both" are often added at the end of penalties in this way. I should prefer to have them deleted here. Are we to read into the Minister's remarks that if his 16-year old son—perhaps he is not yet 16—was caught on a bus with a cocacola bottle in his pocket, the court should not only be able to fine him £200 but send him to prison for 60 days as well? Does he not think that inconceivable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not find it any more inconceivable than sending him to prison for 60 days in the first place if he were found with a coca-cola bottle in his pocket.<br><br>
For better or for ill, we have a situation—which at least one hon. Gentleman recognises—in which it is the normal practice to provide for these alternatives to be available in aggregate. Deletion would make this an exception to the normal rule. If the hon. Gentleman were putting forward a particular reason why he thought that these circumstances were so different from every other case where this is applied, there would be no argument for me to answer, but he has not sought to suggest that. Basically, he said that in general terms he disliked the idea of both penalties being available to the court. That may or may not be a valid point of view, but the amendment would deal with that problem, if it is a problem, I do not recognise it as such—only in one very minute area.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to produce a radical change, I should have thought that there is sense in making it apply to the many hundreds of offences to which provisions like these already apply, and I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0839">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1439</span>
am not convinced that there is any evidence before the Committee to justify our making an exception in this very limited area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment. I shall look at a few statutes to see whether I can find exceptions. In my own defence, may I say that I could not give the Minister an argument because it seems to me that this is a very unusual set of criminal offences. As I said, it is a sort of pre-emptive strike aiming to stop one carrying an offensive weapon which is not really a weapon at all—if the Committee follows my reasoning.<br><br>
This provision is saying that an object that can be carried in any normal circumstances—for example, refreshment in a bottle—becomes in special circumstances, such as going to a football match, <i>per se</i> a criminal offence. It is a very unusual set of circumstances. It is a quasi-criminal offence rather than criminal in the true sense, and I should have thought that there was a case for saying that one should not be at hazard of both goal and fine.<br><br>
I have made my song and dance, Mr. Gourlay. I shall retire rebuffed to sulk about the matter for some time.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about the clause because the Opposition are conerned, as I am sure are the Government, to achieve an improvement in football crowd behaviour and to arrive at the situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) spoke about this morning when he described American soccer and the practice of the crowds at American soccer matches. It was a very useful contribution, because it demonstrated that soccer does not have to have the reputation that it bears if we can avoid the circumstances giving rise to the problem that arose at this year's Scottish Cup Final.<br><br>
I give a cautious welcome to the clause because I have doubts about whether it can be made to work. I am not at all sure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1440</span>
about that. None the less, I appreciate the anxiety of those who wrote the McElhone report and of the Government to find a solution to what has become a very pressing and a worrying problem in Scotland.<br><br>
I want to say something on behalf of work people at football grounds. It is often forgotten that when there is a major football match in Scotland hundreds of people are involved who are not players or spectators but who are there doing a job of work. That includes the police, the ground staff, the press, and stewards.<br><br>
That was brought home to me very strongly when Mr. Eric Craig, the sports photographer of the <i>Sunday Mail</i>—he is also my constituent, my next-door neighbour and a close friend—was seriously injured at this year's cup final. He attends all major sporting events throughout the world in his work and is a very talented photographer, having won many awards for his work. At that game he was struck on the skull with a heavy glass bottle. Consequently, he suffered a depressed fracture which required several hours of surgery, and will now need a long convalescence before resuming his work.<br><br>
That event, which shocked me and others who know him, brought home to me the dangers existing for people who are at their place of work doing their job and who are exposed to that kind of hazard. As I have said, I have doubts whether the clause contains practical proposals for dealing with the problem. I am not certain that it is possible to make this work effectively, The arguments advanced from the Opposition today have been essentially concerned with the practicability of what is being proposed.<br><br>
I am certain that we shall be looking in the future at how it works. I am sure that the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the Under-Secretary of State will be faced with parliamentary questions about the progress and the effectiveness of the measures contained in Part V and, in particular, clause 70.<br><br>
I feel that there is a case for protecting those who attend large football matches and that there is a special case for looking after the interests of work people who, after all, are at their work during those events. For those reasons I would support the clause, but I am entering the reservation that we must ensure that we shall be monitoring a practical proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been drawn more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1441</span>
into the discussion of part V than I had either expected or hoped, but matters arise that one has to discuss.<br><br>
There is a change in the clause as drafted. We have been concerned with the question of alcohol. The Minister's definition this morning was that we want to make a break, to disrelate alcohol from football. But now we are on to the nature of offensive weapons, and there are one or two questions I should like to ask.<br><br>
We talk here about a container which is or was in its original manufactured state. I presume that means that where one has a can and it becomes compressed or crushed, it is still treated in the same way as a controlled container. We are trying to get a definition that encompasses the offensive weapon which is or was a container. There is, therefore, a link with alcohol but the emphasis is on the offensive weapon approach. We do not mean a leather gourd, where we happen to be playing Spain. Presumably that would be permissible because it would not be harmful in the same way, but I suspect that it would be a controlled container. The point is that it would hardly be capable of causing injury. There are problems regarding
<br><blockquote><p>"a medicinal product for a medicinal use."</p></blockquote>
When the Solicitor-General is eventually arrested for carrying his drinking stick at Murrayfield and tries to claim medicinal purposes, he will find it difficult to get corroboration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be reassured to know that a "medicinal use" has to have one of the meanings assigned to it by section 130 of the Medicines Act 1968. I doubt whether that includes the refreshment of any hon. Gentleman present today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all know the appropriate section, but even in that there may be some ambiguity.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General would find it difficult to prove the nature of the medicine and, in that respect—if I may look forward a little, Mr. Gourlay—clause 74 says that the container
<br><blockquote><p>"shall…be presumed to conform to the description of the liquid on the container."</p></blockquote>
If the container says "Younger's beer", it is presumed to contain Younger's beer. If I were Dr. Johnson, I would say, "Sir, that is some presumption", knowing the usual contents of the cans that are hurled
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1442</span>
around football grounds after half-time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that one purpose for which the medicine may be given and consumed under clause 70 is contraception. Perhaps, therefore, whisky would be useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Solicitor-General is getting past it; I would not know. However, that is not the point that I was making. It is like the famous question: what is green, white and gold and flies at Ibrox? To which the answer is: Usher's beer cans. That is the most common of all the containers that whistle through the air.<br><br>
There are difficulties here. We come back to the same problem—the attempt to break the relationship of alcohol to sport—and we have now come to the question of the container. I do not disagree with the clause, but I think that its application will be extremely difficult and, in some cases, dangerous. I do not see it simply as an attempt to stop alcohol but as an attempt to stop offensive weapons. That means that the search powers in clause 73 take on a wider meaning, and I am anxious about that.<br><br>
I should like to have more comments from the Minister on how he sees the matter—whether as an anti-alcohol measure or as an anti-offensive weapon measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman concluded by asking me to comment, and I shall do so briefly. Clearly, there is a connection that we cannot avoid between the consumption of alcohol at football grounds and the use of the containers, from which the alcohol has been consumed, as missiles. The hon. Gentleman is correct to draw a distinction between a container in its original form and one that may have changed somewhat, either by accident or design. I do not refer only to crushed cans. A more obvious example is the broken bottle, which clearly is no longer a container capable of carrying liquid but which is relevant to our discussion.<br><br>
The clause lays down the criteria for the purpose. I accept that it is difficult to draft a form of words that meets the general requirement. While, in general, we are dealing with alcohol-related containers, we cannot confine ourselves exclusively to that, because clearly any broken bottle, whether it originally contained alcohol or lemonade, is just as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0841">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1443</span>
suitable, and has often been used at football grounds, for inflicting damage or assaulting members of the public watching the match. It would, therefore, be artificial to try to distinguish between bottles on the basis of the liquid that was originally in them. For that reason, the clause does not seek to distinguish in that way, but is more concerned with the damage and injury that the container may cause. I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is a more relevant criterion to apply.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 48, leave out lines 25 to 27.<br><br>
I shall not develop a long argument in moving the amendment. It basically takes us back from clause 73 to clause 4. It is the same principle of stop and search. Just as clause 4, or any other clause, will require the co-operation of the public to make the provisions work, so will clause 73 require the co-operation of all who attend designated sporting events to make it work.<br><br>
The Opposition's bleat on paragraph (<i>b</i>) is just as strong as it was on clause 4. The stop and search powers will do untold damage to the police/public relationship as much on the street as at designated sporting events. That is why I am anxious that the Opposition should maintain their position on stop and search powers and ask for the provision to be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I support the point that has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). However, as we may not get as sympathetic a response from the Minister as we should like, may I ask a supplementary question? If the Minister resists the amendment and insists on keeping paragraph (<i>b</i>), will he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1444</span>
say something about the criterion of "reasonable grounds to suspect". Perhaps he can do that in a couple of sentences by saying "It is the same as when the phrase was used in an earlier part of the Bill." But it would be as well to get that on the record.<br><br>
The Minister will remember that he agreed after a lengthy debate that reasonable cause for suspicion meant that the suspicion had to crystallise on each person searched. The Minister did not preclude a group search, but it was a group search of a very small number of people who were connected with the suspicion and on whom the suspicion had individually centred. The Minister specifically ruled out—that was very helpful in the general debate—the possibility of everyone going into a dance hall being searched or everyone in a dance hall suddenly being sealed off and searched before leaving.<br><br>
Can the Minister say a word or two about football grounds? It would be possible for someone to think—I hope that it is not intended—that under clause 73 (<i>b</i>) it would be likely that everyone going into a ground should be searched on the basis of the suspicion that if a person goes to a football match he is likely to be carrying a can because he would be a man of dissolute habits. There might be a search of everyone entering the ground. Is that what is envisaged under paragraph (<i>b</i>), or is it the more restrictive concept of reasonable suspicion which occurred in clause 4?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the 50,000 or 60,000 people attending a football match were required to be individually searched, they would have to be advised several hours beforehand if there were any prospect of their entering the ground before the match had been completed, never mind begun.<br><br>
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the criteria under which the search can be carried out under the clause are the same as in clause 4. It would not be possible to have random searches because the provision specifically relates to the police officer having reasonable grounds to suspect that the person whom he is searching has committed, or is committing, an offence under this part of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) seeks to delete entirely the power of the police to search persons entering a football ground. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman has argued as he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1445</span>
has. He says that he is required to do so in order to show consistency with the opposition to the search for offensive weapons. But he must appreciate that, however strong or weak his arguments were on clause 4, they are of no relevance to this discussion. Much of the Opposition's argument on clause 4 related to what they believed to be the adequate powers provided under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. They argued that because of that Act it was unnecessary to give additional powers of search to the police. But the hon. Gentleman must be well aware that if we were to delete these provisions from clause 73, the policeman would have no power to use the provisions of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 because that is only concerned with the offensive weapons. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we are not dealing here with offensive weapons but with alcohol that is to be taken into a football ground. The police, therefore, would be in an impossible position.<br><br>
Opposition Members have rightly emphasised the difficulty of enforcing provisions of this sort at the best of times. If, however, the police are to be faced with a situation where they have absolutely no legal means of ascertaining whether somebody is walking into the ground with what might appear to be something under his jacket, they must allow that person to continue with the alcohol until he chooses to bring it out into full sight of the police officer, and only then will it be possible for a charge to be brought. That would make the difficulties of enforcement absolutely impossible to overcome.<br><br>
I do not want to reopen the argument about offensive weapons, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept, on reflection, that the arguments, however valid they might have been as regards that power, are of no relevance to the debate as to what is appropriate under clause 73. Without the power provided under that clause the police would have absolutely no way of ensuring that persons entering a football ground were carrying alcohol, unless the person was literally holding it in such a way that was completely visible to whomsoever was looking at him.<br><br>
Any attempt whatsoever to conceal would be sufficient to prevent the police from doing anything. They would not have yet seen the alcohol, and for all they knew it could be anything, and because it was being concealed and, therefore, not visible, they could not search him and, therefore,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1446</span>
they would effectively be utterly powerless. I am sure that is not what the hon. Gentleman intended by his amendment. I think he thought that this was similar to the provision under clause 4. While it might seem to be so, I ask him to reconsider his support for the amendment, given that the Prevention of Crime Act—which I know he supports—would have been of no assistance to the police under those circumstances. For that reason, I hope that he will not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister has ever attended a football match, but the prospects that open up are extraordinary and in some ways frightening. That is one of many objections to the initial police powers of search under clause 4, and indeed a decade ago when it was being argued it was on precisely the problem of the police constable seeking to stop and search a group of individuals and the mayhem and aggro that might ensue from that.<br><br>
The thought of a few police constables outside Hampden Park, with 50,000 supporters pouring in to see a game—though maybe they would have allowed Hampden Park to collapse by then, or Parkhead or Ibrox—is frightening if the Government and the police try to apply a kind of prohibition. What this is now extending to is "No beer on coach parties, no beer in your possession as you approach the ground, no beer inside the ground." I find it very difficult to envisage this possibility and think it will create a lot of aggro.<br><br>
I see the logic of the Minister's case in relation to search. It is not totally unrelated to the kind of requirement that the proprietor of a dance hall may lay down or one that we ourselves voluntarily undergo in an airport, that we take as part of the contract we make. We have a lot of educating to do between now and the next football season to see that this kind of contract is being undertaken. If it is a matter of direct suspicion, it will be extremely difficult to see how any policeman faced by large crowds of people flocking into a park can say "I have reasonable grounds to suspect him". Many people will be carrying coats—not just the bloke with the coat over his arm. One may say that he looks a little drunk. But there is comment here about anyone who is already drunk. Many people who have taken drink look fairly happy, including those who carry it well and those who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1447</span>
do not. How this provision will be fulfilled I do not know.<br><br>
The whole project is dangerous. I understand that it is difficult for us to resist a measure which tries to deal with a difficult situation. But at least we have to minimise the potential dangers that arise from it.<br><br>
We have given immense powers in relation to coach parties and containers. If we then push our luck a little further to encourage and allow a search outside, I know what will happen. A shout will go up immediately. Someone will say "They are searching Jimmy and he's got the beer". Then, in comes the crowd unseen by other police in the area.<br><br>
I wish that the Minister had gone to football matches more often. Then he might know of the impossibility of this provision.<br><br>
Partly to be consistent with the provisions of clause 4 and partly because another little edge of danger is being introduced, I wish that the Minister would agree to withdraw the provision. While I accept his logic of the analogy to the contract of entry to a dance hall and so on, my instinct is to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On almost every occasion I find myself agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). But, in the light of his remarks, I have some doubts about agreeing with him on this occasion.<br><br>
I believe that this recommendation was the principal recommendation of the McElhone report. The McElhone working group was made up of people with practical experience. My hon. Friend challenged the Minister about how many times he had been to football matches. Equally, he could challenge me. However, the chairman, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) and many other members of the working group have had regular experience of football matches.<br><br>
The principal recommendation of the McElhone report—on page xi—states that
<br><blockquote><p>"it should be made an offence for any spectator to carry, or attempt to carry into a football ground"</p></blockquote>
and so on. The report also states that there should be a great deal of publicity—notices should be displayed and so on—in supporters' clubs and through the media to make it clear that it is an offence.<br><br>
Therefore, we hope that it will totally change the nature of people attending
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1448</span>
football matches. I do not regret the fact that we are to prohibit people on buses from carrying crates of beer, whatever the make of beer. That is a good advance. I am not critical of the Government for that. However, it is unfortunate because it has been forced on us in this sensitive area.<br><br>
My hon. Friends agreed with and supported the protestations earlier about random searches and even supported searching people as they walked down their streets going about their business. However, here we are saying that people are going to a stadium, as one hon. Member mentioned, in the same way as boarding an aeroplane. It was mentioned that when entering an aeroplane one has the certain knowledge that everyone will be searched, not only those who are suspected of having beer cans and so on in their possession. That is a clear expectation and understanding.<br><br>
I have been searched every time I go up and down on the Shuttle. I do not consider it an infringement of my rights. I consider that it is something which protects me against the possibility of being blown up in mid-air and my life taken away. Similarly, I consider that it is reasonable that a policeman should be able to search, if he has a reasonable suspicion that someone is carrying a bottle—which could be the very bottle that hit the next-door neighbour of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) upon the head when he was carrying out his proper duty as a photographer. I consider that it is reasonable, and not an inhibition of our freedom, that people should be searched when choosing to enter—and it is a choice—a sports ground.</span></p>
<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make the point that when my hon. Friend is searched when approaching an aircraft, it is not because there is any reasonable cause to suspect him. It is accepted as a universal contract that this should be done. There are infinitely greater dangers involved in being hit on the head with a container. These two things make sharp differences to this aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That reinforces my argument. As a law-abiding citizen, regularly using the airline, perhaps I should be a bit aggrieved at constantly having to be searched when going on to an aeroplane, but I am not aggrieved because I realize
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0844">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1449</span>
that it is extending my safety and protection.<br><br>
I, like my colleagues, was unhappy about the possibility of random searches in the street of people going about their lawful business all the time, but I am not so unhappy about this, and I hope that my colleagues will give it some consideration. There is some virtue in consistency, but on this occasion I do not think that we are being consistent in voting for this because we voted for the previous provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, Mr. Gourlay. I have been listening carefully to the hon. Member. Do I understand him to be saying that public views and public attitudes are important, and that this will influence things and change behaviour perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was certainly part of what I was saying. What worries me in a lot of what my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West said, is that it is a terribly defeatist argument. It implies that everything will be exactly the same and all that we shall have will be a few policemen hassling the youths who are trying to get in with bottles and cans. I hope that the atmosphere will change in a football ground, and if we do not believe that, we ought not to be entering any of this activity or any of the things we spoke about earlier on. There must be a change, and unfortunately I would have thought that this was a necessary provision. I am not happy about it. I marginally tip over in that direction, but I am willing to be convinced otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) replies, there is one further point I should like to make. It is a very relevant consideration which might well influence the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).<br><br>
Let us assume that these powers are removed from the clause. We are not dealing with a public place. We are dealing with a private football ground. Therefore the obligation of seeking to prevent alcohol coming into the football ground would fall upon the officials of the football ground—the stewards. They would have the obligation, as indeed they sometimes have at the moment, to search if they wished to try to prevent alcohol coming on to the ground. The dangers of confrontation, and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1450</span>
dangers of causing problems with youngsters seeking to bring alcohol on to football grounds will be far more difficult to control if stewards are seeking to search them, than if the task is undertaken by uniformed policemen who are recognised as being officers of the law.<br><br>
Since we are dealing with private not public places, it is in everyone's interests that disagreeable searches that are required should be conducted by uniformed policemen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may sound contradictory, but if the Under-Secretary is thinking along these lines I should have thought that it would be more consistent and logical to say that spectators will have to accept, as a condition of entry to the stadium, that they are liable to be searched, as in a dance hall. That would, as a means of stopping this, thereby avoid the aggro which would be caused to someone who thought he was being searched on suspicion. He would know when he bought his ticket and passed through the turnstile that random searching took place inside the grounds. With a couple of policemen at every entrance, they should be searching every hundredth person. This perhaps will establish the attitude and custom. I am not for it, but it is more logical and is in line with the Minister's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never expected to hear the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) say that he might even prefer random searches to searches where there is reasonable cause. I presume he is suggesting it because he thinks that, on balance, it might be preferable to what is being proposed. On reflection, he might agree that that is the last thing he would want to support.<br><br>
The comparison with the airport is a valid one. It is officials and not the police who search people at the airport, and they have no legal power approved by Parliament to require anyone to be searched.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I advise the Minister? The security staff at airports are designated under the Civil Aviation Act 1978, which gives these people authority, because until then many people were refusing to be searched. I remember going to Gatwick with the predecessor of my hon. Friend the Minister for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) where we both refused to be searched until they sent for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1451</span>
the police to do it. We were not having any dumb blonde looking through our suitcases. I am perhaps taking credit away from the previous Conservative Government. It may well be that it was they who introduced the legislation that gave legal authority to these people at airports to search.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the hon. Gentleman objected to blondes searching his suitcases—perhaps he had no objection to other forms of search.<br><br>
At an airport it has often been said that search is acceptable because if people do not want to fly they do not have to. The same applies equally to a football match. If people do not want to attend a football match they do not have to, but, if they choose to, it is only reasonable that a power of search should be available.<br><br>
The distinction is that whereas at an airport everyone is searched, at a football match it is proposed only that the power of search should be available where there is reasonable suspicion.<br><br>
The main point I put to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is that whereas people at the airport are very rarely drunk or quarrelsome, apart from the hon. Gentleman who objected to the search, the kind of problem arising at football matches concerns those who might already have consumed alcohol, who, even if they have not, are likely to be by their nature more troublesome. Therefore, it is far more appropriate that if people are to be searched it should be by someone whom they will clearly recognise has a legal right to do so by virtue of being a uniformed policeman rather than just another member of the public who may wear a steward's badge or something similar, but who will not have the authority that a policeman will automatically provide. That is an additional reason which I think the hon. Gentleman will want to take into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, we have had a marvellous debate on this side of the Committee. It is a pity that some Conservative Members did not join in. I do not mind the Minister distorting my speeches. I object to his trying to rewrite them, because 90 per cent, of my argument on clause 4 was based on the damage that it would do to relations between the police and the public.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1452</span>
The Minister said a very strange thing. He said that the power of search contained in clause 73 would be exercised in a private place. Of course it will not, because clause 70 refers to any person who attempts to enter
<br><blockquote><p>"the relevant area of a designated sports ground"</p></blockquote>
or sporting event. We then have to ask "what is a designated area"? What is the designated area of Hampden Park? Is it the streets around? Or is it the car parks that are in part of Hampden Park? It is not true to say, therefore, that this kind of search will take place in a private place. I listened with great care to what my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said. He has travelled a long way—69 clauses, to be exact—from clause 4 to clause 73, and all I can say is that I am delighted that he did not make that speech on clause 4 but kept it for clause 73, where it does much less damage.<br><br>
Having said that, I conclude my remarks with a reference to the airport. There are those who say that there are few drunk people at the airport, but I happened to be at the airport three or four weeks ago when the lady who won the Nobel Peace Prize was arrested for being drunk, fighting and so on at Heathrow airport. So it happens to the best of people.<br><br>
Having listened to the Minister, I am prepared to recommend to my hon. Friends that we should seek to withdraw the amendment and leave the matter as it is, at least for the time being. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 49, line 36, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"but shall exclude any licensed premises run by or in association with the owners of the designated sports ground or by the promoters of a sporting event being held there".</p></blockquote><br><br>
I hope that the Minister will regard this as a helpful amendment. We are seeking to introduce a provision which could go a long way, if not to civilise the spectator-ship of football matches, to make it much more comfortable and pleasant for spectators.<br><br>
Let me say at once that it will be necessary to refer to one or two football grounds throughout the country. I wish to tell my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), without chiding him, that I do not disagree with his comments this morning about Celtic football club. I had the pleasure of being there recently and I admit that Celtic, like a number of other clubs in Scotland, particularly Rangers, Aberdeen and, of all clubs, Dunfermline—which ploughed back a great deal of the money it made in the early 1960s—have spent much money on their grounds. There is no doubt that those are modern grounds.<br><br>
I am saying that to lead the Minister to encourage those clubs and others in Scotland to go a stage further. If we look at England, we see a number of football grounds—Manchester United, Leeds United, Coventry City—where restaurants with bars have been built into the main stands and where people can go, either with or without their families, and can sit and have a drink and a meal at the same time as they are watching the game.<br><br>
Aberdeen, in particular, has been one of the most progressive football clubs in the country in modernising its ground. I do not know what Aberdeen's plans are, but it has made a major effort to modernise its ground. I do not believe that it is beyond the realm of possibility that a club such as Aberdeen would wish to do the same as Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, by building such facilities into some of the stands around the ground at Pittodrie where people can have a meal while watching the game in progress.<br><br>
6 p.m<br><br>
Strange as it may seem, while we have no senior football grounds in Scotland with this facility, we have, to my certain knowledge, one junior football stadium where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1454</span>
one can sit and have a drink and watch the game in progress from inside the lounge bar. That stadium, as you will know, Mr. Gourlay, is at Glenrothes. The new Warout stadium there is marvellous. Along the top of the stand at Glenrothes is a very nice social club cum lounge, where people can sit and have a drink and watch the game. It would be a great pity if anything in the Bill denied clubs the possibility of introducing such a facility.<br><br>
The clause provides that any area from which this sporting event can be viewed would be designated under the terms of the Bill. That would be a great pity.<br><br>
I turn to the problem to which I referred this morning. There are a number of senior clubs in Scotland that have parts of their premises licensed but from which it is not possible to see the game in progress. I mentioned that Dunfermline has a club in the stand, as has Raith Rovers; East Fife football club has a social club in the perimeter of the ground; East Stirlingshire has one just outside the ground; Cowdenbeath football club has one outside the ground; even the Rangers football club has a massive social club. I do not know whether it is now in its ownership but that club runs it and it is right next door to Ibrox Park. So there are a number of licensed premises throughout Scotland in close proximity to the club itself. East Fife is the best example because it has facilities inside the perimeter of the ground at Bay view Park at Methil.<br><br>
In trying to implement part V we are trying to make football that little bit more pleasant. We are trying to bring back the pleasure of going to watch football and we should not rule out the possibility of people seeing the game from the kind of premises I have described—the kind of social club premises where people can have a meal and a drink and watch the game at the same time.<br><br>
If the Government accept the amendment, it would have no immediate effect because there is no ground, with the exception of the Glenrothes junior ground at Warout Stadium, that has such facilities. I had the pleasure of going to Dumbarton to see the new stand near the end of the season. Dumbarton football club has spent nearly £500,000 knocking down the old grandstand and building a beautiful new stand with provisions for an extension. I think that with a forward-looking board of directors such as Dumbarton football club has—I have met them all and know some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0847">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1455</span>
of them personally—it is not beyond the realms of possibility that a club would want to build the kind of facilities that are described in the amendment. The tragedy would be that this legislation without the qualification of the amendemnt, would be a serious deterrent to such developments.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. It will not have an immediate effect, but in the case of clubs that want to develop their grounds along the lines that I suggested, will not be deterred by legislation. By the insertion of the amendment they would be encouraged and in the process we would be doing football in Scotland and the spectators who go to football matches in Scotland a great service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by acknowledging the worthwhile objective that the hon. Gentleman seeks. One looks forward to the day when civilised drinking at football grounds can be taken for granted.<br><br>
However, we are not having to look only at objectives, but at the practical implications of such an amendment. The hon. Gentleman has correctly pointed out that it will have no immediate effect either way because the facilities he describes do not exist. But if they did exist or were created, while I have no doubt that the objective of the sporting club that introduced them would be highly creditable, the consequences in the present context would be serious.<br><br>
We would have to envisage a situation where many thousands of people attending a football match could not bring alcohol with them, could not have alcohol on the stands or the terraces and could not consume alcohol except in one small part of the building from which they would be able to watch the match, and where they would, in theory at any rate, be able to consume alcohol to their heart's content.<br><br>
If a club were to provide a lounge bar or an ordinary public bar which had a view of the game, that would produce severe problems. The problem is caused by the desire of many to go to football matches and simultaneously, to get themselves into astate of inebriation. It is not unlikely that one small place in the designated area available to those attending the match where they could consume alcohol would become grossly overcrowded. The original purpose of the area would be completely abused, and his suggestion would be unlikely to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1456</span>
achieve the highly desirable consequences about which the hon. Gentleman spoke.<br><br>
If we can break this automatic link between alcohol and football and return to a situation where a modest consumption of alcohol on the terraces is not automatically prohibited, it would be highly desirable to have as an alternative, comfortable licensed premises within the building from which the match could be viewed. That would be highly desirable if and when we reach the stage where the major problems occasioned by alcohol are no longer with us. But if we are to go from a situation where alcohol is freely available to one where it is barred from all parts of the ground, apart from one small room—or even a large room— it is not implausible or unlikely that the modest facility provided for the best of reasons would be grossly abused by those who would be likely to use it.<br><br>
For that reason I think that it would be inappropriate to encourage clubs to provide that type of facility at present. Clearly that facility to which the hon. Gentleman referred is desirable in its own way, and there is nothing to stop a club developing such a facility to provide other forms of refreshment. Maybe many people coming to a football match are content to drink coffee, tea or other non-alcoholic beverages and are delighted to do so off the terraces and the stands and are still able to watch the match. The only question is whether the provision of alcohol should also be available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy for what the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said. I declare a small interest as a patron of Arbroath, the only team in the first division that went down this year. It is important that there should be an opportunity to develop along these lines, particularly if eventually there are to be ancillary sporting activities associated with football stadiums. That would be a desirable step.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister would consider whether it would be possible to include within the designated area licensed premises which were run for the supporters' clubs for the night. If the Minister is concerned that there should be no drinks consumed during the period of a football match, would it not be possible, as part of the granting of a licence, that no licence was allowed and no alcoholic beverages sold for, say, an hour or 45 minutes before the match?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0848">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1457</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is permissible in the Bill as it stands. Under clause 75 the period of a designated sporting event is specifically defined in the clause and it means the period commencing two hours before the start and ending one hour after the end. There is nothing to stop alcohol being consumed in a designated ground at any other time. Therefore, there is certainly nothing to stop clubs from developing facilities of that kind or even providing licensed premises. During the period of the designated sporting event, they would not be permitted to sell alcohol. The point made by my hon. Friend is highly desirable and would be possible under the provisions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be clear on this? Under clause 66 which is the designation clause, as I understand it, the Secretary of State would be able to designate a sports ground or a class of sports ground and a sporting event. Do I understand for example, that it is envisaged that the Secretary of State would not simply designate "Gayfield stadium", but "Gay-field stadium for first division"—if we are optimistic—or "Second division football matches during the season 1981"? The designation will not simply relate to that ground, because if that happened the provision he referred me to would not come into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The order approved by Parliament would designate specific grounds and specific events. It would, therefore, apply in those circumstances. But my hon. Friend will see that each of the offences, as it were, that can be committed under this part of the Bill specifically refer to the
<br><blockquote><p>"period of a designated sporting event".</p></blockquote>
That period is defined in the clause as being the period commencing two hours before the start and one hour after.<br><br>
Therefore, even if we were dealing with a designated sports ground with a designated sporting event taking place, there would be nothing to stop alcohol being consumed more than two hours before the start or more than one hour after the end. If, for example, a sports ground, used mainly for football, was also to be used for other sporting occasions which had not been designated, there would be nothing to stop people bringing alcohol into the grounds on those occasions or licensed premises in the grounds selling alcohol at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1458</span>
any time other than the period designated for the sporting event.<br><br>
That, I believe, meets my hon. Friend's point, and I hope to a large extent meets the point of the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth. I know that ideally he would like, and ideally I would like, there to be some limited facility that would not be abused and that could provide for responsible members of the public to have a small liquid refreshment of an alcoholic kind during a match while they watched the match from inside the lounge.<br><br>
We have to look at the practical implications for the 50,000 people watching the match, all of whom knew that this was the only place they could go to in order to watch the match and consume alcohol simultaneously. I believe that the consequences would not be what the hon. Gentleman intends, certainly not what the Committee would wish. For that reason, I hope he will feel able not to press his amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ideal situation would be as a buttress of what he is attempting to do here, and in fact to make alcohol available in the grounds. The alternative to banning alcohol is to make it available inside. In other words there could be a series of bars in which people could hire their cardboard or plastic cups or containers. They are loathsome things from which to drink beer, but that would be their choice. The containers would not be dangerous and those who prefer to queue up rather than watch the game would be out of harm's way. No one can drink the contents of 24 containers on the trot inside a football match, but those who wanted the odd cup of beer could get it. That would seem a most harmless way of dealing with the situation. It could not lead to drunkenness with that definition of time, nor could it provide a source of harmful containers. It could take those people who preferred to drink than see the game from interfering with the spectators. It seems to me that that could be the one solution. It is not like a cricket match where one can get in at 11 o'clock and drink until half-past six.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That suggestion would not be possible for a series of reasons. First, anyone who was intending to spend the whole period of the match consuming alcohol would be better advised not to go in the first place. Although he may not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0849">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1459</span>
take that advice, it is clearly the best that could be given to him.<br><br>
As for the general question of the consumption of alcohol in parts of the building from which one cannot view the match, there is no way of, as it were, determining in advance how many cups of beer or spirits a person would consume. Clearly, such persons might become drunk. I do not see what they would benefit from that. The whole purpose of going to a football match is, presumably, to watch the match, and that does not seem to be an unreasonable point to make. Certainly, I do not think that one could legitimately complain, because anyone whose primary function was to consume alcohol could go to any public house in the city.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I do not understand the motivation of the hon. Gentleman when he attends a football match, but I assume that the viewing of the match is his primary motivation and, therefore, it is what he is permitted to do while viewing the match that is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The football fan goes to football in company to watch a game in company. He hopes that it will be good, happy company, although if enough aggro creeps in it may be fairly malicious company. But the aim is to be with company having a drink. That is why the Scottish fan goes. He does not go to make an academic examination of the match or go in isolation to watch the game. He wants to talk about it, to ruminate, to analyse, to kick hell out of the manager, in company with others. They drink together and in most places that is done pleasantly. All I suggest is that there should be long bars around the sides of the ground at which one can get about a third of a pint, where one has to queue up. Anyone who goes for a drink will have a hell of a job to drink more than a couple of pints in the course of an hour and a half. Instead of the paraphernalia in the Bill, that might solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment. One of the difficulties here is the pretty miserable system provided in Part V. It may, in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1460</span>
short term, have to be miserable because of the problem we face, but it is a situation that we would not wish to continue any longer than necessary, because it precludes all sorts of civilised developments and civilised habits at football grounds, which the Minister himself hastened to say he would like to encourage. We are allowing very few chinks here which would give them an entrée to the present rather dreary atmosphere of the average Scottish football ground.<br><br>
I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). The amendment is talking not about, as the Minister suggests, licensed premises to which anyone attending the match can go. What I think he is thinking about and what I am certainly thinking about is a specific club for members only, where people who belong to the supporters' associations— the kind of people whom we are trying to encourage to bring their families to broaden the basis of support, and so on—can go during the away matches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should look at the definition of "relevant area" which is where the prohibition applies. To be part of the relevant area where the prohibition applies it has to be, apart from anything else, an area to which
<br><blockquote><p>"spectators attending a designated sporting event are granted access on payment".</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Gentleman is referring to a part of the premises to which spectators as a whole are not entitled, but to which only a small number of people, because they are club officials, players or something of that kind, may have access, it may be that it would not be prohibited under the clause in its present form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I have not a wide-ranging knowledge of grounds in Scotland but, as I recall, in Kilbowie Park in Clydebank, for example—my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) may be able to help me— the social club is almost part of the banking at the far end of the ground. One can sit in the lounge of the social club directly overlooking the football pitch. Surely that comes within the designated area. It is a nice path of argument.<br><br>
Is the Minister saying that a member of a supporters' club who does not have to go through the normal turnstile to reach an entrance to that club, even though the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0850">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1461</span>
club is situated within the designated area, would be allowed to drink? In other words, is it permissible, if there is a special entrance for members only, for a member once inside the supporters' club to have refreshments and so on while watching the game from a lounger? If that is allowable a lot of my worries would be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would not be possible because that would be an area from which one could view the match. The difficulty is that the arguments against allowing that kind of provision are exactly the same as those against allowing alcohol to be consumed in the directors' box. I am sure that that will appeal to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The prohibition, which includes the directors' box, is not imposed because there is a tendency to throw broken bottles or because there is wild drunken activity in the box. It is imposed because it would create an enormous sense of unfairness if the spectators could see alcohol being freely swigged by those who would seem to be in a privileged position in certain parts of the stands and terraces. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am being accused of putting forward Socialist arguments. Although I may get Opposition Members to support the clause I may lose some of my hon. Friends in the process.<br><br>
Basically this is the problem. A sizeable proportion of people would, by virtue of some payment or membership of a club, be seen swigging alcohol. That is the relevance of viewing the match directly, because, if people could view the match, others would be able to view them, unless there were one-way screens similar to those we are proposing for identification parades. We do not have that provision. Therefore one would flow from the other and, for the reasons which the hon. Gentleman used in connection with the directors' box, I believe it would have to be accepted that similar arguments would apply in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about this jealousy factor. I assure the Minister that I am delighted by his conversion to Socialist idealism. However, I am not entirely convinced. I believe that if there is a social club in the grounds, it will be accepted that it is possible to get refresh-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1462</span>
ments there although it is not possible to obtain them when standing on the terracing.<br><br>
That is so now in the sense that if people take beer on the terracing they are doing so by private enterprise which we all know to be a wicked thing. The vast majority of people recognise that a drink cannot be obtained in a football ground. They are not consumed with jealousy because others may be able to obtain a drink in some specific part of the ground.<br><br>
Therefore I am not convinced. I should like to see an element of flexibility built in. We are almost constructing prisons and calling them football grounds. The Minister should look at this matter a little more flexibly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perturbed that we may preclude the kind of development in Scotland for which we would all wish. I have been in a number of stadiums abroad where one can sit down, have a meal in a restaurant and watch events. I have never partaken of hard liquor while doing so, but others have. I understand that we would all wish to see that kind of development. Such developments encourage family involvement. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to a decision may I say that I find the debate depressing. The Committee is now enveloped in fear of what might happen. We have a chance to take a slight step beyond what the Government are suggesting and what the Opposition are supporting. We recognise that something needs to be done. The Minister says that the point made by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is covered because one can get a drink until 1 o'clock and can then start drinking again at 6 o'clock at night. Everyone knows that that is not the situation that we are trying to create. We are trying to make football into a family sport again. I am most anxious that we should test the feeling of the Committee on the matter, and I therefore intend to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are very short of time and that we have quite a distance to go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Gourlay. First, does the period of a designated sporting event take account of extra time at a cup tie match? In terms of the wording, I have some reservations as to whether it does. Equally, does "relevant area" mean that, if there is a car park, as there is at Murrayfield, to which a charge is made for a car entering, and where one cannot go in to see the game without paying the entrance fee to the car park, that car park becomes part of the designated sports ground?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The designated event is concluded whenever it is concluded. If the match is continuing, clearly the provisions still apply. I think that the point is pretty obvious, but I say that for what it is worth.<br><br>
As to the car park, if it is part of the sports ground, presumably the owners of the sports ground will be well aware of the fact. It will depend on whether they own the car park. If it is a car park for the use of those using the sports ground, or an area to which spectators of the event are granted access on general payment, it will clearly be covered by the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And if one can see the game from it?</span></p>

VANDALISM</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 339, in page 50, line 8, leave out "or" and insert "and".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 340, in page 50, line 8, leave out "or recklessly".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a quick correction to amendment No. 339, and therefore accept that it is faulty in its wording? It is the first "or" in line 8 to which the amendment applies, not the second. This was pointed out to me after I had tabled the amendment, and I apologise to the Committee.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
I am seeking to provide that the clause shall read
<br><blockquote><p>"any person who, without reasonable excuse, wilfully and recklessly destroys or damages any property",</p></blockquote>
rather than "wilfully or recklessly".<br><br>
I accept that the word "recklessly" is already in other statutes but it has a very loose meaning. "Wilfully" can be defined fairly carefully, but "recklessly" could have connotations that under this new legislation could lead to prosecutions of people for what are essentially accidents rather than wilful, malicious damage which is presumably what vandalism is supposed to be. When children play football in the street they have no intention of kicking the ball in such a way that it does damage.<br><br>
We all know, however, that sometimes a child will let rip with a kick harder than he had intended and the ball goes through a window. The damage is done. Under the clause as drafted he could be charged with the crime of vandalism as a result of that accidental kick. If that is the case, the clause is badly worded. I should prefer to see the word "and" rather than “or".</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0852">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1465</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways I am doubtful about my hon. Friend's amendment. I am concerned about the use of the word "recklessly". The word "wilfully" seems to be right. If we are concerned with criminal justice, "wilfully" is appropriate. It is true that with regard to motor traffic accidents, careless driving is an offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two different offences—careless driving and reckless driving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful. "Careless" as distinct from "reckless" has a different connotation in the case of car accidents. In the case of a driving offence, a man has to exercise control. When he fails to exercise proper control he then constitutes a danger for which he is responsible. We therefore properly have the offence of careless driving because there is an onus of responsibility laid on him. But when we introduce the word "reckless", it means that his carelessness is magnified. He is not only being careless in the sense of not noticing something, but he has been more than careless in the bad manner in which he drove.<br><br>
The word "recklessly" in relation to vandalism—and this is a new offence that I am not sure is necessary—specifically means "carelessly". I took the trouble to look up the shorter Oxford Dictionary and that is why I think that "recklessly" with regard to cars means something different from the usual usage. The dictionary says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Reckless … Careless of the consequences of one's actions; heedless (of something); lacking in prudence or cautious. Of actions, conduct, things, etc."</p></blockquote>
An example of use given for reckless is:
<br><blockquote><p>"A reckless increase of population."</p></blockquote>
Carelessness—yes. Lack of cautions and precautions—yes. But in a sense of reckless as applied to the driving of a car, that is a very different matter. So if we are just talking in terms of carelessness, which is one of the two examples given here, I do not believe that we should introduce the word "recklessly".<br><br>
For instance, there is a difference where a child who goes to the telephone booth and puts a boot, a brick or a sledge hammer through it, or throws a brick through Mrs. Smith's window when she is not in. That action is wilful; it is an act of will.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1466</span>
There is a difference between that and the carelessness of kids who are playing over the hedge at football, kick the ball, and the ball hits Mrs. Smith's window. That is careless, but it could be reckless, because older people might have known that this was likely to happen. Young kids may not know that it is likely to happen. There is a degree in the carelessness before it becomes reckless.<br><br>
I broke two windows in my life. I broke one when I was 7 years old. I broke another when I was 14 playing cricket, and a letter was sent to my father, and with seven years in between—half of my life at that time—he came in waving the letter and said "So you have broken a window again". There is a distinction. I was not being reckless. I might have been careless. I did not think that I could hit the ball that hard.<br><br>
So I believe that it should be left to the word "wilfully". "And recklessly" is an improvement, because it still keeps in the word "wilfully" as being necessary, but I would prefer to leave it out altogether. I now realise the full significance of this, but certainly it cannot be "recklessly" in isolation. Therefore the "or" must go. I think that "recklessly" must go also. I think my hon. Friend is right, because if we were to leave the offence based only on "recklessly", the definition here in general conduct of affairs is "carelessly". If a man is in charge of something such as an internal combustion engine or a drill he alone, as part of his job and responsibility as a driver, has to exert much more care than a bloke who is just walking along the pavement. It should be applied to general conduct and general behaviour. If something goes wrong and there is an accident such as a ball going through a window—a bit of fun that suddenly goes wrong—I think that the requirement should be "wilful". A malicious act of will has to be shown.<br><br>
I am not sure that there are real difficulties in terms of proof. In most cases of vandalism, as we know vandalism, we are thinking not of careless vandalism but of wilful vandalism. We are not thinking of the bloke who kicks the ball over the hedge, and through Mrs. Smith's window, we are thinking of "wilful". If that is what we mean, let us say so. Do not let us push our luck and the law's luck by introducing the term "recklessly and carelessly", because with vandalism we are talking particularly about young

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1467</span>
people.<br><br>
It is a bad provision to put into a law. It is not just that it is wrong in the sense of protecting people, it is wrong in our concept of vandalism, because we are not trying to say to kids "You must be ultra careful all the time and watch when you are playing football". We all say that kind of thing. We are really concerned with the wilful act of vandalism, which was why this action was brought in as an additional offence. I am not convinced that it is necessary, but that is what the Government had in mind and to which they should turn again. To put it more strongly the Minister should accept either "and", or both amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I can go through the whole of the law of jurisprudence in one minute, but I shall do my best.<br><br>
Even the crime of murder is subject to the two concepts that if a person deliberately kills somebody or acts so recklessly that it demonstrates a disposition depraved enough to be regardless of the consequences, he is guilty. In the case of murder a person cannot say "I did not mean to kill anybody. I just wanted to hear the hand grenade go off. Admittedly, I threw it into a pub, but nobody told me that anyone was inside." The concept of law requires either that a person does something wilfully or that he demonstrates by what he does an indication that he does not care what has happened.<br><br>
I give a simple example in vandalism. If one were to accept the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), if a person damages property wilfully and carefully it would not be an offence. If a person aimed the brick with the greatest of care rather than simply throwing it over his shoulder, that would not be an offence, because he would have done it wilfully and carefully rather than wilfully and recklessly. So that would be absurd. I hope that the hon. Member for Cathcart understands that.<br><br>
Now let me take the middle stump, which is still standing and see whether I can knock that out of the ground. If we remove the words "or recklessly", all we should have to do would be to play cricket in the Plant House at Kew and say "We were playing cricket. We were not trying to break the windows. We did not try to break the windows. We were not wilfully break-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1468</span>
ing windows; we were wilfully playing cricket." But it would be reckless to play cricket in the Plant House at Kew because one would be likely to break all the windows.<br><br>
It is not a question of carelessness. It is not a question of a little boy playing football and kicking the ball in the wrong direction and breaking Aunt Fanny's window. That would not be reckless because the amount of culpa, which in law means blame or evil intent, would not be present. Recklessness is understood in law not just in Road Traffic Acts, but in all common law, to mean an indication of circumstances which indicate behaviour in which a person does not care whether he does damage. That is the point. To miss out "recklessly" and to say "wilfully" would mean that to throw a stone at a window would be vandalism, but to throw a stone over one's shoulder, not knowing whether it would go through a window or not, would not be vandalism. Clearly, that would be absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take the Committee further on this. I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point about my amendment. He is absolutely right. Having got him already this afternoon on his ability to park his car at Murrayfield and have a drink in the car park, I think that I might concede that on this occasion he is right.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will reject the clause. It is unnecessary, it is totally spurious, it is a facade, it is cosmetic, it is ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is reckless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is reckless. It is wilful. It is brought in merely to pretend to satisfy some people in the Conservative Party that something is being done about the problem.<br><br>
I shall not go on at great length. Let me merely quote the Law Society of Scotland, for whom the Solicitor-General should have a passing respect. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council is convinced that there is no need for such a special offence. These matters may be and are satisfactorily prosecuted under the present law relating to damage to, or destruction of, property by wilful or reckless means."</p></blockquote>
The clause is totally unnecessary. I hope that we shall vote against it.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I always am. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is, I have to admit, not always as brief as he was then. With him, I shall certainly oppose the clause. As my hon. Friend said, it is a cosmetic exercise to satisfy the same populism as we had with the short sharp shock. It is unnecessary, for it is already covered by existing law—in my view, better covered because existing law will take better account of the large differences that there can be between the various acts of vandalism, which may vary from very minor offences by young children to quite serious damage by older children, teenagers in particular. The existing law can take account of the problem better that this blanket coverage of "vandalism".<br><br>
The only problem with existing law, so far as the Conservative Party is concerned is that it is difficult to pin down the exact statistics on vandalism. That is the only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1470</span>
real reason that I have heard advanced for introducing the provision. I do not think that one can pin down the act of vandalism, because I do not think that there is a specific action or event that can be called vandalism in all circumstances. The same act may be an act of vandalism in some cases, but not in others. Therefore, I shall vote with my hon. Friend against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the clause. In its substance, of course, it adds nothing new to the law of Scotland. However, it serves two useful purposes. First, the general public do not understand what the offences are of which people might otherwise be convicted when, for example, a window is broken or a wall is sprayed upon. The fact that it now has a modern name which is understandable and acceptable to people seems to me to make up part of the public duty of this House to ensure that people understand what is put forward as an offence. That seems to me to be one acceptable objective.<br><br>
The second acceptable objective of the clause is to ensure that, when an offender comes up on a future occasion charged with the same offence, on his list of previous convictions the offence appears as vandalism. Although that is a limited objective, I see it as both necessary and desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is a matter of making the offence comprehensible, would it not be sensible to change culpable homicide to something like manslaughter? Are there not many more offences in law which could be given simple names? Is this not a lot of nonsense?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept that. There are, of course, such crimes still on the statute book, much beloved of the Solicitor-General, for example of hamesucken, which still appears there. It is never charged, although people are quite frequently convicted of circumstances which would amount in law to hamesucken. It does not appear in the indictment very often in these days, but it is there. Vandalism is modern, relevant and understood by the public at large, and it is my view that, generally in Scotland, when someone is convicted of vandalism, people will understand what has been done. In those circumstances, the clause is desirable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause is a deceit and a nonsense. It has been brought in for purely cosmetic purposes, and it ought to be opposed. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has made bricks bravely without straw, but as to previous convictions, I think that malicious mischief and breach of the peace are well understood. They are not obscure technical terms that mystify the general public. Any sheriff worth his salt looking back can see what court the prosecution was taken in and what was the disposal and would have a fair idea of what it was about. If there are any special circumstances the plea in mitigation will undoubtedly cover it.<br><br>
The whole matter is totally fraudulent. It is an attempt to pretend that something constructive is being done when nothing constructive has been done, and I shall vote against the amendment with pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether; I shall spoil the hon. Member's pleasure. One of the duties of the law is to reflect public opinion. I do not believe that a newspaper would use anything other than the word "vandalism" to describe the matters we are discussing. The headlines will not say "Mischief malice makers sentenced to prison"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has been at a controlled container.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1472</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but I am looking forward to one in 10 minutes.<br><br>
It is important that the law should visit with colloquial categories the offences which are committed. Just as murder and rape can be charged as assault with aggravation, murder and rape mean what they say, and vandalism is a most serious manifestation. It creates a great public fear and it is proper that it should be in our category of known offences. If hon. Members think that hamesucken and stouthrief are not offences that worry them, we do not need to use the terms. But vandalism worries everybody and they know what it means. It should be an offence. It is the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Solicitor-General for Scotland says is absolute rubbish. The Government know that this will not reduce vandalism by one-half of 1 per cent, and will not reduce malicious mischief by one-half of 1 per cent., for the simple reason that witnesses will not go into court. That is one of the major problems. All my hon. Friends say that this is a cosmetic presentation. It is a pretence that the Bill does something that it does not, and we shall all vote against it.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 5.</p>
<p>Under-Secretary that this is a most reasonable amendment. It provides that the provision may be made by voluntary organisations as well as by the local authority directly. The local authority may appoint voluntary organisations to act on its behalf. I should have thought that this was the kind of amendment that would find favour with the Government, given support for voluntary organisations. It gives increased flexibility. It need not be used if local authorities do not so wish but it gives them the opportunity so to do.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It

just goes to show that if the vandals on the Labour Benches would use those good-mannered and sugar-coated approaches to me, they would see that tears are never far from my eyes. My heart is almost broken and I am able to tell the hon. Member that I accept this amendment in principle. I would ask to allow me to consider the drafting of it. There are already under sections 4 and 59 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 arrangements with voluntary organisations. We would want to draft the amendment in the same terms as section 59 of the 1968 Act. So if the hon. Member will accept my assurance that we will table a suitable amendment to make this enlightened reform available, I assure him that we will. It demonstrates how good manners and good grace can go a long way with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this stage of the Bill and with my name on the amendment, I have to say that after that acceptance I shall have to look again to see what we did wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat overwhelmed but I accept the Minister's assurance. The intention was to have something exactly like the 1968 Act, for which my hon. Friends were responsible, and I am sure that the Solicitor-General will, with advice, be able to draft a much better provision that I have been able to do with the help of my advisers. On the basis of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just sorry, Mr. Gourlay, that you did not see fit to call amendments Nos. 250 and 251 to give us the opportunity of a hat-trick. They would have allowed the Solicitor-General, on behalf of the Government, to give finance for day centres and other categories of persons, such as those not on compulsory after-care and those out on bail. That would have been a great improvement.<br><br>
I shall not vote against the clause because these categories are not covered, but I hope that the Government will give them consideration. I know that the social work profession would be very grateful.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1474</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must help the hon. Gentleman. The fact that the amendments were not selected does not allow him to discuss them in clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not going to. I was merely mentioning how sorry I was that they had not been called and that the clause as a whole does not provide for day centres. I hope that the Government can consider the matter. Perhaps it can be dealt with in another way, but there is certainly strong feeling among social workers that some account should be taken of this area.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 281, in page 83, line 36, after "section", insert "205(3)".<br><br>
The amendment rectifies a minor omission from paragraph 17, which deals with the revocation of licences of prisoners who are convicted while on licence.</span></p>

This amendment rectifies for Scotland a defect in section 64(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 by inserting a reference to section 61 of that Act.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, with amendments Nos. 150 and 151, amends section 19 and section 305 of the 1974 Act which gave an arrested person the right to have a solicitor informed of his arrest without delay.

The amendment would add to penalties which may be raised in line with inflation. Those are the penalties under clause 9(2) and 9(3) of the Bill for failure to attend for precognition, for prevarication or refusal to give evidence. I recommend the amendment.</span></p>
