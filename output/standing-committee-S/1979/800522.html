	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I recognise the work and the pressure which 	<i>Hansard</i> especially is under and the immensely able work it does, and it is not customary either for me or for other Members to make a minor correction, but I would like to draw attention to an error, possibly on my part, which has crept into column 495, which I should like to correct because it has an unfortunate implication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About eight lines from the bottom, there is a sentence beginning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They are withdrawn on the advice of community and welfare workers who tell the police".</p></blockquote>
The word should not be "police". The sentence should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"who tell the youngsters it will make things more difficult for them in future if they proceed."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 20 May 1980, col. 495.]</p></blockquote>
Since these proceedings will, no doubt, be discussed by the police, I stress that there were no implications there of control by community workers over the police. It is a warning given to young people. I would like that corrected because it has an unfortunate implication. At least we have it on the record now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
terms of being probing amendments. This is an occasion on which a probing amendment may get us valuable information which will help us greatly to limit and perhaps to give structure to the "stand part" debate which undoubtedly we shall want to have on this clause. I have no intention on this amendment of arguing the case for or against increased powers of search or of expressing my attitudes in any general terms to the merits of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to discover exactly what the Minister thinks is being achieved by clause 4, exactly what powers it will give the police and how they can be exercised; in particular, what extension it is over and above the powers that presently exist in section 1(3) of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. It is a matter, in other words, of definition, because it may be, for reasons that I will explain in a minute or two, that if we did not get a proper explanation from the Minister we could have a rambling "stand part" debate in which we would be tilting at imagined fears about something which was not in the Bill at all and was certainly not in the Minister's mind. It is just conceivable—I do not rule out the possibility—that, having listened to the Minister in response to this debate, many of my worries about the effect of clause 4 will be removed. That would be a considerable help to me and to other Opposition members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to approach this in a detailed and serious manner. I have re-read with great care, and I hope in a reasonably open and fair-minded way, the debates about the powers of search that occurred during the last Committee stage. Having studied very carefully the words of the Solicitor-General and the speeches of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and various other hon. Gentlemen, I am totally confused as to exactly what is in the Government's mind, and exactly what this extension in the powers of search amounts to. It seems to me that there are two possibilities. If I oversimplify the arguments, it is in order to illustrate what I mean and perhaps help the Minister when he comes to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know one thing which this new clause 4 is not; it is not a random power to stop and search. This is something that has been bruited around in the past, particularly by the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) in his Scottish incarnation. We were all relieved when the amendment was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
moved on the last Bill—the same virtue is in the present drafting—to see that there was no suggestion that there should be random powers to stop and search but that there had to be a trigger of reasonable suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having established that limited virtue, we are then in a difficult morass of textual interpretation and drafting. There are two general approaches. One is that we might take this interpolation into the Bill, this new clause 4, as merely a way of tidying up the powers that already exist under section 1(3) of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. Members of the Committee will remember that there are in that section a number of features which might be thought to be inconvenient and administratively difficult to exercise. For a start, if one is to search under section 1(3) of the 1953 Act one has to arrest, and, while that may be a technical nicety, I see that there might be an argument for saying "We do not want to have to arrest. Let us have the power to search on reasonable suspicion merely by detaining in the street." It is the kind of argument that was used by the Solicitor-General on the last Bill when distinguishing the powers to detain and take to a police station under clause 2 of that Bill. He argued that, in order to search, one did not want to have to cart someone to a police station; that that was an unreasonable imposition upon the suspect as well as upon the police. Similarly, we might be arguing that clause 4 was merely to get rid of this necessity to arrest, and I might have some sympathy with that, except that I think it is a very arguable case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might go on to say that we have to tidy up the powers under section 1(3). They are perhaps rather formal restrictions, but they are there in statute and statute ought to be listened to by police officers. One might want to get rid of the restrictions and say that this power to search could be used only if there was confusion about a person's identity or place of residence or if the constable
	<br><blockquote><p>"has reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary to arrest him in order to prevent the commission by him of any other offence in the course of committing which an offensive weapon might be used."</p></blockquote>
I think there would be a strong case for saying that we do not want all these restrictions; we do not want this hedged around with all these caveats and subtle sophistications. What we want is a simple
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
straightforward power for the police, where there is reasonable suspicion that an offence is being committed, to detain and, with the minimum of fuss, with the minimum of "aggro" and friction, to carry out a search of that individual on the spot and then either act, because an offensive weapon has been found, or let him go, presumably with something of good grace, if the search is entirely negative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that was the spirit in which clause 4 was drafted, I might well have some reservations about it in detail, but, to be honest, I would not want to obstruct it in principle. I think that the reservations in the 1953 Act to which I have referred are ones that we could do without. If it is a tidying-up operation, if it is a matter of reasonable cause for suspicion crystallising on an individual, and the right to detain on the spot to search that individual—full stop—I think that would remove an enormous number of my fears about the clause. There was some evidence in the 1979 debate that that is what was in the then Opposition's mind. I will quote from what the present Solicitor-General said in column 59 of that Committee stage. I suppose this was an attempt to encapsulate what the Conservatives were doing. He said it was an amendment
	<br><blockquote><p>"in order to make the very brief 1953 Act effective."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 59.]</p></blockquote>
If we took that in the narrow sense of "effective" and used the words "clarifying the powers", I should be very reassured, and it would reduce my further participation in any "clause stand part" debate to a minimal one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is another possibility. I go to extremes in a sense, but I have to canvass it in view of a number of quotations that I have found in the 1979 debate. The possibility which I find a little more alarming is the suggestion that this is not merely a matter of removing the restrictions in section 1(3) of the 1953 Act but a radical extension of power for the police which would allow them to do things, particularly in terms of group and mass searches, which could not in any way be countenanced under the present statute. If that is the situation, I think the Minister would accept that we are in the area of controversy and in the area where it is certainly possible to argue in terms of counter-productive friction between the public, particularly groups of the public, and young people. Clearly, these matters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
must be fully canvassed in the "clause stand part" debate. I am anxious to know in which area we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this is a rather technical debate but I should like briefly to develop this point because I think it is important. I have been fascinated by the drafting of this new clause. One of the difficulties about the Bill is that once one has decided what is intended in this new clause 4 one has to decide whether the actual words in the legislation could possibly support the construction which might be put upon it by Conservative spokesmen. The reason I find it so difficult is that, having carefully looked at this new clause 4, I cannot see that it is a great extension over the powers that we already have under the 1953 Act, apart from the tidying-up process to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make a point which may sound like a narrow textual point but which I hope I shall illustrate as one of major importance. When originally the new powers of search, so-called, were introduced into the Labour Government's Act by the Conservative Opposition, they introduced it in the following very important terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A constable who has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person may be carrying an offensive weapon may require that person to allow the constable to search his person".</p></blockquote>
I draw the Committee's attention to the phrase "may be carrying". The interesting point is that in this new clause 4 the words "may be carrying" have disappeared, and what we have in their place is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person is carrying an offensive weapon."</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee may think that there is no importance in the change from "may" to "is", but there is enormous importance. One of the first things I should like from the Minister is an explanation why the word "may" has disappeared. The reason why I put enormous emphasis on this is that again and again when challenged in the 1979 debates to explain what the new power was, which part of the new drafting would allow a real extension of police powers, we were told that it was the word "may". Now the word "may" has gone. Perhaps I am being over-hopeful, but does that mean that the claim for this radical extension of police powers has gone with the word "may"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one or two quotations. I will not weary the Committee but I think it import-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
ant that we establish the significance of the point I am raising. The present Solicitor-General, challenged by myself on this very point, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is not so".</p></blockquote>
He was distinguishing between the new powers of search and the clause 2 powers. He quoted clause 2 that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A constable has grounds for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence."</p></blockquote>
In grammatical terms it is very like this new clause 4 as drafted. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our amendment says 'may be carrying a weapon', which is not the same. For instance, if a constable came across young Donnie Dewar and on 10 previous occasions he had been convicted of running about the streets with a knife, he would have no grounds for suspicion whatsoever that Donnie Dewar was carrying a knife, and therefore was committing an offence. But he would have very good grounds for suspecting that he 'may be carrying' a knife. That is the distinction, and the important one."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee.</i> 23 January 1979; col. 62.]</p></blockquote>
So, the present Solicitor-General, when challenged, was saying very specifically that that was a distinction. The word "may" is the important word, and I think that we should know what difference there is with the disappearance of the word "may". Would "may" allow Donnie Dewar or anybody else, merely on the grounds that he had previous convictions, to be an object of suspicion and search under this new clause 4? It is a subsidiary point but one to which no doubt the Under-Secretary will want to turn his attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend for interrupting but once or twice he has referred to new clause 4. In view of the fact that there was a new clause 4 of the previous Bill and in order not to confuse those who may read the 	<i>Official Report,</i> I am sure my hon. Friend would want to make clear that it is to clause 4 of the present Bill that he is referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I was rattling on. That is a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the present Solicitor-General, under challenge from myself, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member should read carefully what the Act says."</p></blockquote>
He went on to quote his new clause, which he was then introducing:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A constable who has reasonable grounds for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
suspecting that a person may be carrying an offensive weapon",</p></blockquote>
and so on. He goes on, rather surprisingly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The law as it is now says that a constable must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is carrying an offensive weapon. In other words, he has to be certain in his suspicion before he can search, in terms of the Prevention of Crime Act.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Let me give an example which occurred recently in the High Court of Glasgow, where a constable was informed that somebody had been seen with a knife, but he did not regard that as sufficient grounds for suspecting that person A, who was known to be the troublemaker, was the person who was carrying that knife. Therefore be took the view—and, as the law stands now, rightly took the view—that he could not search him."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 60.]</p></blockquote>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an extraordinary interpretation, in my view, of the present law. But, from the point of view of my argument, the interesting thing is that the hon. and learned Member, who is now Solicitor-General for Scotland, went to great lengths, when pressed, to say that the important distinction was the use of the words "may be carrying" as distinct from "is carrying". As I have said, "may be carrying" has been jettisoned under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is interesting is what is left if the word "may" goes out. It may be the fact that the Under-Secretary will hold to the argument that clause 4 of the Bill, as drafted, still gives a significant increase in police powers. He may argue that it will allow, for example, group searches. If so, I shall be very interested for him to explain exactly how he justifies that from the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—now the Government Whip—also addressed himself, presumably as an advocate, to this problem. I think he was being questioned by me. In any event, he referred to the phrase in clause 2 of the Bill,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person has committeed or is committing"</p></blockquote>
and went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The situation which we envisage is one in which the words 'may be' are used."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; c. 102.]</p></blockquote>
So he as an advocate was saying that the distinction which he could find was that "may be" was imported into the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
He went on, if I may say so, to give a rather melodramatic example of people choking to death in their own blood, and six to eight men running from the scene and the poor policeman being unable to do anything about it because the words "may be" had been sadly omitted from the statute on a previous occasion. I make the point that the hon. Gentleman firmly tied his colours to the idea that in fact there was a new power of group search. When pressed to describe it in terms of the wording of the statute, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The situation which we envisage is one in which the words 'may be' are used."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that he was backing up again the hon. Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the same theme, the hon. Solicitor-General made very clear that he believed that group searches were being allowed by the new form of words which were being imported. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a police constable had power to search a person who he believed 'may have'—not 'does have'—an offensive weapon, then, in my opinion, that would greatly increase his powers for the good of all and to the detriment of none."</p></blockquote>
He then went on to give examples of how this new power could be used. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is an incident in a dance hall and somebody is seen in the street or in a house with a knife and the police are called, then, without the certainty or the justified suspicion that it is Mr. A and not Mr. B, C, D, E or F, the police can search nobody. But under the amendment the police could search all the people in the dance hall if necessary".</p></blockquote>
Then he goes on to take a similar example of a mobbing and rioting, with shouts of "Up the Yogi", and says the police would now
	<br><blockquote><p>"be entitled, seeing their mood,"</p></blockquote>
—that is, the mood of those who are shouting "Up the Yogi"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to search them and to ensure that none was carrying a weapon."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; col. 69.]</p></blockquote>
These are two specific and fairly stated examples of group searches, but again, when asked to justify them in terms of where the power to do it lay—the distinction between this new clause and the section 1(3) formulation in the 1953 Act—the Solicitor-General hangs his hat on the words that someone "may be committing" an offence, as distinct from "has committed" or "is committing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have group searches, may we have it confirmed that that is the under-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>527</span>
standing of the Government, and that that new power is specifically included or justified under clause 4 of the Bill as presently drafted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that this sinister "may" has been omitted—presumably on the advice of draftsmen—will the Under-Secretary go through the exercise of putting himself in the position of a solicitor in the Glasgow sheriff court who has to persuade a sheriff—or it may be a counsel or High Court judge—that the words in the section as presently drafted allow the big extension, of which he is talking, over and above the powers in section 1(3) of the 1953 Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time when the new powers were being introduced into the last Bill, the hon. Under-Secretary of State had no doubt about it. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. and learned friend"</p></blockquote>
—that is, the now Solicitor-General—
	<br><blockquote><p>"said that he wants the police, when they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that one person of an identifiable group is carrying a weapon but are unaware as to which person might be carrying a weapon, to have powers to search each of the individuals concerned. That, I suggest, is a perfectly legitimate and desirable proposal."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; col. 107.]</p></blockquote>
That was his intention. The first thing we want to know is whether that is still his intention. If it is his intention, will he please explain to me how it is justified in the wording we have here at the moment? He bolsters his argument in terms of the report of the working party of the Scottish Council on Crime. I have looked very carefully at the appendix which deals with this matter, and it is extremely interesting. It has opinions, for example, such as that it is very unlikely that this new power will prevent crime in terms of detecting it at the spot. It hopes that it will be a general deterrence argument, which is a very different approach from that which the present Solicitor-General, for example, was using in relation to the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the narrow point on which we are arguing—whether the group power of search is included—I can find no authority whatever. The general proposition is stated in paragraph 84 of the report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposition which we have considered is that power should be conferred on a police constable, if he has reasonable cause to believe that a person is committing the offence of carrying an offensive weapon in a public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse … to stop and search that person."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that, on a normal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
construction, it refers to suspicion of a person and that person being searched. It does not open the door to group searches on a more generalised suspicion that somewhere in the area there is someone who is carrying an offensive weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked right through to paragraph 90, which is at the end of the appendix, with great care and I cannot find any authority or any sentence that could be taken to mean that the Scottish Council on Crime had come down for the wider interpretation that the present Under-Secretary was using during the debate on the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no secret of the fact that my view is that a fair interpretation by anyone, solicitor or layman, of the terms of clause 4 as we see it at the moment, is that suspicion must crystallise on an individual, and it is only that individual who can be searched. The point of putting in the words "one" in line 26 and "particular" in line 29 is that it would put the position beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These may be only probing amendments, but they are intended to ventilate what I consider to be a very important matter and to make sure that we know what we are talking about—that we are on all fours with each other. It may be that battle will have to be joined on clause stand part even more seriously, when we have heard the Under-Secretary. At least there will not be this dreadful ambiguity. It is an ambiguity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be too specific about this, but I had the opportunity of discussing the question with a High Court judge and a sheriff in the west of Scotland recently. It is not only advocates who keep good company. I was discussing with them whether they could find any words in the clause, as presently drafted, that would justify an extension to group searches. These gentlemen very reasonably looked at it, and they then looked at it again. They assured me—they might not wish to say so in any public sense because they might be called upon at some point to interpret the words in their judicial capacity—that on first examination they could find nothing to justify the widening of the powers to take in group searches on a general suspicion that someone in that group may have an offensive weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Under-Secretary to say that it is right to get rid of any confusion over identification or fear that there might be a further offence. Where there is a specific crystallised suspicion of one person, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
want to give the right to detain and search that person with the minimum of fuss. If the Under-Secretary were to agree on that, I should be happy to withdraw from further argument on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that it is not that but that it is the group search—which, in rather flamboyant terms, has been described so often by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West and by the present Solicitor-General in the debates on the previous Bill—I say that we are in the legitimate area of aggravation and friction and it is a new departure. Before we plunge into that argument, I want to be clear that that is what we are talking about, and I look forward to the Minister using his professional skills to convince me that the words in the clause as presently drafted could possibly stand that far-reaching interpretation. I look forward to what the Minister, or any other hon. Gentleman, has to say on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in introducing his amendment, said that he was wishing, for the purposes of it, to concentrate on a narrow, technical matter, and therefore would not go into a wide-ranging debate on the whole question of stop and search powers. If the speech that we have just heard is not a wide-ranging debate, I wait in dread to hear what the hon. Gentleman would consider to be a wide-ranging speech. He did not confine his remarks merely to the question of group searches but went into a very wide discussion of a great deal of the implications. I do not necessarily criticise him for that. I simply make the point because I think it is valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first basic point on which the hon. Gentleman asked me to comment was the reason why the Government did not take the view that the present provisions of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 were sufficient to deal with the sorts of problems which the Government recognised to exist. Clearly, the Scottish Council on Crime did not think the 1953 Act was sufficient, otherwise it would not have thought it necessary to propose an alteration in the existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of the Committee to the specific requirements that have to be met before the 1953 Act can be invoked, and these are the reasons why the Scottish Council on Crime—and, indeed, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
Thomson committee—did not consider these to be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the power to arrest without warrant a person whom the police have reasonable suspicion to believe has committed an offence, can only be applied if the constable is not satisfied as to the person's identity or place of residence. That is a rather obscure and unusual form of requirement, but nevertheless, it is a specific requirement of the 1953 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the constable has to believe
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is necessary to arrest him in order to prevent the commission by him of any other offence in the course of committing which an offensive weapon might be used."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is a Prevention of Crime Act provision to give the constable power to arrest and prevent other crimes being committed, and that, clearly, is a very narrow situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point of distinction is that the 1953 Act can only be used where the person who is to be arrested is in any public place. The offence in question is the possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, and it is only if the constable comes across him in a public place that he can then, with the other safeguards, apply the particular power that the 1953 Act provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a series of very narrow requirements which have to be satisfied before a constable can use the power provided for him under the 1953 Act. It was the narrowness and unsatisfactory nature of these requirements, clearly, that led the Scottish Council on Crime and the Thomson committee and the Government to take the view that a substantial change is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not merely propose a minor tidying-up of an otherwise ambiguous clause. Our objectives are not quite as wide-ranging as some of the critics of this clause have suggested. Nevertheless, we would not shrink from suggesting that this is a substantial change and is meant to be a substantial change, and that is why the Government have put it forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason why I would argue that the 1953 Act is not sufficient, in addition to the detailed reasons which I have given so far, is that, even if the conditions are satisfied, the power that is given to the constable is a power to arrest. We know from our previous discussions on detention that the power to arrest can only properly be exercised when the constable is intending to charge the person concerned with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>531</span>
offence for which he has been arrested. That requires a degree of certainty which it would be highly undesirable to have if all we are talking about is a power to search for a weapon that is being carried at a particular time. It means that if the constable thinks that the person is carrying a weapon, first he has to arrest him. He cannot arrest him until he is prepared to charge him. If having arrested him, and thereby having the right to search, he finds that the person is not carrying a weapon—which obviously will happen on occasions—indeed the whole basis on which the arrest has been carried out will have been unsubstantiated, no charge will be levied and we shall have a very unsatisfactory situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument very carefully. Would he not accept that, clause 2 having been introduced into the Bill—that is the power of detention—that power of detention, unfortunately perhaps, could do exactly what he is now suggesting and that, therefore, clause 4 is unnecessary? If a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is carrying an offensive weapon, which is an offence of itself under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, surely all he has to do is to detain him rather than actually arrest him under clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He could certainly proceed in that way but that would be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. If he uses the powers under clause 2, he is required by the agreement of both sides of the Committee to take the individual concerned to a police station as soon as possible. If the hon. Gentleman will place himself in the position of a member of the public who may be stopped in the street, I think he would far prefer to be quickly searched and then, if we did not have a weapon, be allowed to go on our way. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I would certainly prefer that to having the full rigours of clause 2 applied—to be taken to a police station, there searched, and only then for it to be found that it was not necessary to detain me longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are simply concerned with the benefits or the information that might be obtained from a search, the quicker that search is undertaken the better from everyone's point of view. I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman was in the position of being someone who the police had reason-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
able cause to believe was carrying an offensive weapon but he was not so carrying one, he would rather get it over in five or 10 seconds than be taken to a police station for that purpose. If he wished to go to a police station, I am sure that the police would be only too happy to facilitate such a journey, but I suspect that in the vast majority of cases persons would not wish it and it would be pointless to insist upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, again we come to the situation where it is right that the old principle in Scots law, a very strong principle, that a policeman does not arrest someone until he is in a position to charge him with an offence should not be tampered with. If all we are concerned with is an opportunity for the police, where they have reasonable cause to believe that a person is carrying a weapon, to have the power to search him right away, if they search him and find a weapon, that is the time to arrest and charge him. If they do not find a weapon, the person can go on his way. That seems a far more satisfactory way from the public's point of view. I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Garscadden agrees with that. Therefore, the provisions of the 1953 Act are unsatisfactory because they require arrest before any search can take place. That, clearly, is not a satisfactory situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden then drew the Committee's attention to the provisions of clause 4 of the Bill. He asked for some clarification of exactly what powers were to be provided for the police under this clause. In particular, he wished to know whether there would be a power for the police simply to search someone because they knew that the individual concerned, whether Donnie Dewar or anyone else, had on numerous previous occasions been convicted of offences involving the carrying of weapons, or any other kind of offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly not the Government's intention that the mere previous background of an individual member of the public should amount to reasonable suspicion which would entitle the police to search an individual. It may be one factor in a series of items of evidence available to the police. For example, if an individual is seen running from a building in somewhat suspicious circumstances and is known to have committed criminal offences in the past, it would be unrealistic to ignore that factor in its entirety in determining whether there was reasonable suspicion that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
might be carrying an offensive weapon. It is certainly a relevant consideration, but it is not the Government's view that that by itself should be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the hon. Gentleman's fear, which is one which I share, is that that could lead to unfair harrassment, that individuals, simply because of their past, would be subjected to what, in effect, are random searches on the street by police officers. It is not the Government's intention that the police should have random powers of search, either for ordinary members of the public or for members of the public who have in the past transgressed the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are not dealing with the realms of random search, either for the general public or for any individual. There must be reasonable suspicion that on the occasion in question the individual whom the police wish to search is carrying an offensive weapon. That is the important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really cannot see how a constable is to take that decision. If the knife is tucked down a person's sock, how does he have reasonable grounds for suspecting unless he has a previous record to go on or the person is in a particular place, dressed in a particular way, and so on? Unless the person actually has a gun which shows quite clearly under his jacket or is carrying a gun in his hands, I do not see that the constable has any reasonable grounds for suspecting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman any number of examples. For example, the police may receive a telephone call from a member of the public that a certain youth has a knife in his possession which he has put in his pocket. He may have been waving it around in a dance hall. If the police come five minutes later and the youth comes out of the dance hall with the knife nowhere to be seen, in these circumstances the police would have reasonable grounds to believe that the individual was carrying an offensive weapon. The fact that they could not see it would not be relevant if they had been told that five minutes earlier he had been waving a knife around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely that point was brought up and denied by the Solicitor-General in his previous incarnation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain about that. I should have to look at what my hon. and learned Friend said, either in his present incarnation or in any previous incarnation. I am quite satisfied that if the police had been told that an individual had been waving a knife around in the dance hall a few minutes earlier and if he came out of the dance hall and the knife was nowhere to be seen, a police officer meeting the youth would certainly have reasonable grounds for believing that he was carrying an offensive weapon and would be entitled to search him to see whether that was the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that that sort of case is already adequately covered under section 1(3) of the 1953 Act. The constable there would have very reasonable grounds for believing that the person was carrying an offensive weapon and arresting him on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There are two ways in which the 1953 Act would be inadequate, even for the example which the hon. Gentleman has given. First of all, it would only be relevant if the constable was not satisfied as to the person's identity or place of residence—and it might well be an individual known to the police—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not "or"; "and". Sorry; yes, "or". Nevertheless, that is one of the factors on which the police normally have to be satisfied. Secondly, there is a requirement that at the time in question the youth has to be in a public place. If he is not in a public place at that time, he is no longer committing an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will let me finish the point he can happily intervene thereafter. If the youth in question, having been waving a knife in a public place, thereby committing an offence, has left the dance hall and gone immediately to his home or gone immediately to a private party, and the police then contact him and are invited in, so that they are in a place where they are entitled to be, under the 1953 Act they would not be entitled to arrest and search him because at the time in question he was not committing an offence because he was not in a public place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just using the example which we are dealing with at the moment, that would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>535</span>
a circumstance in which in two ways the 1953 Act would be insufficient for the purposes concerned. We are only dealing with one example which has been given. There are various other examples which one could equally give, but in that example the 1953 Act would clearly be inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major point which the hon. Gentleman raised on the amendment was whether it was the Government's intention and whether the effect of the clause was to permit group searches of the kind which he indicated. To a large extent, the answer to this depends on how one defines a group. If we are talking about the police arriving at a dance hall where there may be 50 or 100 people present and they know that there is a knife somewhere there, clearly in those circumstances it would be totally wrong and inappropriate for the police to have the power to search the people present. Clearly, that would, in effect, be a random power of search. Equally, if the police came into a much smaller gathering, of even half a dozen people, and it was known that a knife was present, that by itself would not under the clause in its present form be sufficient to give the power to the police to search everybody there. There has to be more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 in its present form states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person is carrying an offensive weapon … the constable may search that person".</p></blockquote>
That is specifically put down in that form and is meant to operate in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume a situation which very often applies, where there is a small group of people and one may have reasonable cause to believe that they are acting in concert—three or four people, perhaps a gang. Many of the people we are dealing with walk and act together and behave as a group during the course of an evening. If the police have reasonable cause to believe that there has just been an incident involving a knife and that these three or four people who are clearly together were involved in that incident but they cannot prove which person has the knife—perhaps, indeed, the knife has been passed around two or three of them precisely for this purpose—it is certainly the Government's intention that the police should in these circumstances have the right to search each of the persons involved in the incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman tells me that, in his view, or in the view of individuals to whom he has spoken, that would not be permitted under the present drafting of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>536</span>
clause 4, I must say to him that we shall look very closely at that. If it is not permitted, we shall certainly change it so that it will be. In these circumstances it would be quite unreasonable to prevent the police from having the opportunity to search the individuals concerned to ensure that the knife was obtained and that the person in whose possession it was found was charged with the appropriate offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is why I say that it depends on how one defines a group. It is not the intention of the Government that there should be random searches of groups of people. The police must have some reasonable suspicion that each of the individuals whom they search could be the person who is carrying the knife. It need not be a certainty: if it were a certainty, the 1953 Act would normally be sufficient. But where they have reasonable cause to suspect that one of the individuals in a small group is carrying a weapon, it is certainly our intention that they should have the right to search that person and, if they find a weapon, charge him with the appropriate offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the changes envisaged in clause 4 are not as wide-ranging as he feared and as some have suggested, but nevertheless would give significant additional powers to the police. They are intended for that purpose. It would be quite ludicrous to bring forward proposals if they did not change the existing situation. I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider the appropriateness of his amendment and to inform the Committee accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be very brief because we are still thinking over the words in the definition which the Minister has given. The principle is one which is probably better discussed in the "clause stand part" debate, despite the fact that the Minister widened the debate in a way which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) did not. The entire burden of his argument was related to the narrow point of the amendment whether this refers to a single person or whether it can be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that I thought that the original tenor of the Minister's argument was that the interpretation of the clause should be on the lines of the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
of my hon. Friend, but he changed that towards the end and it became quite clear that it is allowing for the possibility of group searches. This is in line with his own remarks in col. 107 during the previous Committee proceedings when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have powers to search each of the individuals concerned."—[	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 25 January 1979, col. 107.]</p></blockquote>
That, I suggest, is a perfectly legitimate and desirable proposal and in line with the comments from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and from the Solicitor-General. They are envisaging group searches, but the problem, he says, is how to define a group. We are back to the classic question "How long is a piece of string?" A group can, presumably, be that which the constable reasonably decides is a group which is searchable and not a group that is too big to be unsearchable. Is this not the point? I do not think we can accept that. The first three-quarters of the Minister's argument was running completely counter to that. He agrees that there must be evidence to suggest that the offensive weapon is likely to be among this number, but it might be a very widespread number, particularly in a dance hall, maybe in threes and fours through the evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should appreciate—I hope I made this clear; if I did not, I apologise—that before the police could use this power they would have to be satisfied and have reasonable cause to believe that the individual person who is going to be searched is carrying a weapon. If they did not have that reasonable cause they could not use the power of search.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to envisage a situation where, for example, in a normal crowd in a dance hall, or any other gathering, the police would be able to satisfy that condition. It is quite a different matter when we are dealing with three or four people who might have been behaving as a group, acting in concert as a gang, or something of that kind. That is a totally different situation, a gang situation, and there we believe there should be the kind of power I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But this is precisely the difficulty that the hon. Gentleman's new measure sought to clear up. He referred to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
the difficulties under the 1953 Act and the kind of ambiguity of mind which a constable would bring to bear on that—whether he had sufficient certainty to arrest. The same problem arises in relation to a group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many circumstances in Glasgow or any other area, if a knife has been seen and the police arrive, the passing around of the knife, if those concered are taking protective action, may very well be much more wide-spread than the three, four or five members of the close-knit group. There will very frequently be a communal response in which the knife will be getting passed around, and in each of these cases, as it passes from hand to hand, the constable will feel that this is an extension of the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know specifically the difference between the words "may" and "is". It suggests that the Government are genuinely trying to retreat from their previous view on this. I hope that is right; that the word "may" that the Solicitor-General stressed now changed to "is" suggests that the Government are getting away from the concept of a kind of group search in their thinking. The question is whether the clause does it or not, or whether a constable may reasonably assume that that retreat has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to the 1953 Act. I do not want to spend too much time on this. I would prefer to leave it to the expertise of my hon. Friend. I suggest that the powers in the 1953 Act are neither so ambiguous nor so narrow as the Minister suggests. The main argument for our opposition to the detention clause was that it brought about a situation of arrest without the full legal panoply and, therefore, protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 three basic conditions are laid down. One is public place, the second is knowledge of identity—and in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)—if one prefers, instead of (3)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or has reasonable cause to believe"</p></blockquote>
in order to prevent the commission of a crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to look at these to decide whether this was exactly what was wanted. On the "public and private place" this Act was brought in. All the argument that had been adduced during the whole long period of argument about powers of search was dealing with the "public place" situation. It was dealing not with the question of entry into a private party in order to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>539</span>
search, but the random stabbing that was taking place, the violence that I was told was continually happening on Friday and Saturday nights in Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland. It was specifically this problem for which these proposals were brought forward in the beginning and are brought forward now—not in relation to the private place or the private party, where in any case the question of a likelihood of causing a breach of the peace would allow action, even if it did not allow the operation of the 1953 Act. We are dealing with a different situation. This provision is perfectly satisfactory for "a public place".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or has reason to believe that it is necessary to arrest him in order to prevent the commission by him of any other offence".</p></blockquote>
This leads us into the area of how powerful the certainty and the suspicion must be. This is precisely the qualification that we require. It is a qualification that should cause no fear on the part of a constable. We argued against the detention proposal because we say in the case of arrest that there is a certain protection to the suspect as well as to the constable himself. The protection that is given here to the constable is specifically his ability to make out the grounds that he has reasonable cause to arrest the person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the basic argument why I prefer this description. We shall be dealing with that in the "clause stand part" debate, and it is related to what happens when a constable meets young people in this kind of situation and institutes a search. That is the trigger point which I want to avoid, and which I think is bad. The arrest is a much safer situation, as we shall see in discussion in the "clause stand part" debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1953 Act seems to me right and sufficient. Constables have told me in the past that they have felt inhibited or prevented from using it. I cannot see that. The situation involving a public place, where there is reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary to arrest, seems to me a perfect safeguard to the constable, and it is the one that should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that there has been a major pull back, in expression at any rate, by the Government on previous views. It also, however, by the process of that pull back, makes nonsense of the case in principle of search, to which we come at this point. The argument for the case on search was to prevent the public mayhem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>540</span>
which it was claimed was happening, the problems of group activities, the problems of the innocent bystander, the problem that those of us who have gone to visit the casualty wards in hospitals on a Friday or Saturday night have seen. That is the purpose of it. If the Government really mean what they say, and are retreating from that point, and want to base it on an individual, those powers of search do not apply. If necessary, the powers of detention may apply—if they feel that they must stick to that clause when we get to Report stage. Certainly the arguments for this power do not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is wise to have tabled the amendment, and he is more than wise to stick to it, because either the Government believe that it should be done on this individual person basis or they do not. If they do not, it makes a nonsense of the basic arguments that have been adduced in the previous Committee stage, and in the long years of the freneticism of the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) on the question of powers of search. I would, therefore, like to see the Minister going further. If the Government are leaving their former position and coming back to the individual position and proceeding with the clause, they must accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the words "any person is carrying", followed by the words "may search that person", provide sufficient safeguard. They do not. He said that a group—two, three or whatever—can be brought in, and that group aspect still remains. That position can only be safeguarded by the particularising which is done by my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always when the Under-Secretary is replying to debates, we get a much more interesting and sophisticated approach. I hasten to tell him that I have had some reassurance—perhaps rather more than I feared and rather less than I hoped—and I am to some extent stranded in limbo as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of rigid party discipline on this Bill. It is in a sense a non-party issue on the Opposition Benches, and we must all make up our own minds. I take a less hostile view of the particular clause than do some of my colleagues, and a less hostile view than I take of some other clauses in the Bill. With only a little more of a concession the Under-Secretary would carry me into his camp.

I would have much preferred it if the Under-Secretary had said—and I accept his argument on this—that section 1(3) of the 1953 Act is unsatisfactory because it implies arrest, it implies conditions about confusion over identification and address, and because it has a somewhat artificial concept of a fear of a further offence, and has also the "in a public place" restriction which I did not mention in my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that the Under-Secretary had said "That is it, we really want to get rid of all these just to make the position more clear-cut." Although I recognise that I would not have carried all my hon. Friends on this, the Under-Secretary might well have had the better of the argument and have found himself with some very unlikely allies, or an unlikely ally, but he has slightly retreated from just leaving it at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so, we have had in the Committee this morning a major betrayal. I am not trying to rub salt into the Under-Secretary's wounds but I was extremely interested by the revelation that he has not read the speeches of the present Solicitor-General in the Committee which dealt with the previous Bill. I can totally understand his diffidence in this matter because, I am sure that it would give him many a sleepless and unpleasant night tossing and turning. But if he were to read them and those of other Conservative Members, he would see that what he has outlined this morning is an absolutely major retreat from what I genuinely understood to be the Government's position. Who can be more authoritative than the present Solicitor-General? I am in no way using these words sarcastically. He is at the moment improving himself spiritually in Edinburgh, I understand, and which of us in this Committee would wish to discourage that process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous Bill, when asked to give an example of how the new powers would work, the present Solicitor-General gave an example which has been specifically, and in very welcome terms, ruled out by the Under-Secretary today. The present Solicitor-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is an incident in a dance hall and somebody is seen in the street or in a house with a knife and the police are called, then, without the certainty or the justified suspicion that it is Mr. A and not Mr. B, C, D, E or F, the police can search nobody."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>542</span>
That is under the present law.
	<br><blockquote><p>"But under the amendment—</p></blockquote>
that is the amendment with "may" in it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the police could search all the people in the dance hall if necessary in order to eradicate the knife from further use, if it had already been used, or from use at all if it was merely being carried and used as a threatening weapon."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 25 January 1979, c. 69.]</p></blockquote>
That was the central example of the new power that the present Solicitor-General gave. We now have from the Under-Secretary a specific and precise assurance that he would not see these powers covering a situation where everyone in a dance hall could be searched. I welcome that as an absolutely major retreat to sanity by the Government, and one that is very welcome. I am not saying that the clause is not still damaging. We shall come to that shortly. But I very much welcome the Under-Secretary's limitation of the damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and as it is important to have this clarified, I turn briefly to what the Under-Secretary said. Apart from the negative virtue of ruling out random group searches—group searches of everyone in a building, everyone in a football match, everyone in a public house—let us see what we are left with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in passing that I am still unhappy about "reasonable suspicion". Again, I am very glad that the Under-Secretary has specifically repudiated the Solicitor-General's remarks in column 62 in which he said clearly that previous convictions would be reasonable suspicion in themselves. I am glad again that that has been repudiated. I regard that as an extremely helpful step forward from the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not so happy about the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that they might be a factor and that another factor, for example, would be to see someone run from a building. We are talking here about a clause which, even in the form which the Government are proposing, is specifically geared to an offence under the Prevention of Crime Act. Someone may be running from a building and breaking glass may have been heard or the circumstances are such that it may be thought that there has been a housebreaking. However, I am not sure that that would be reasonable sus-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>543</span>
picion that an offence under the 1953 Act was being committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will be the first to accept that under existing law there might be a situation where there might be a number of incidents or items of evidence which might be reasonably innocent in themselves, but when they all appear in conjunction with one another they could give rise to reasonable suspicion of an individual having committed an offence. It is by no means uncommon for the courts to convict people on the basis of that kind of accumulated evidence. What I was wishing to make abundantly clear was that if there were other items of a suspicious nature and the police were aware that the individual concerned was a person of a criminal background, it would be unrealistic to expect them not to take that into account, and it is right that they should take it into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that cumulative evidence at the end of the day can be impressive. The point I am making is that I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's repudiation of what are perhaps some of the more excessive claims of the present Solicitor-General. But if there is to be evidence, my key point would be that it ought to be evidence that gave rise to a suspicion that an offence under the 1953 Act has been committed and not just an offence—full stop. After all, these powers of search are not to stop and search someone because a housebreaking has been committed and one may find the proceeds of the housebreaking on the person. There is no such power. It is specifically because there is a suspicion of an offence under section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is cardinal that, whatever the reasonable grounds for suspicion, it cannot be that there is something fishy or something funny or housebreaking or anything else going on; it must be something that leads to reasonable grounds for suspicion that it is an offence under Section 1 of the 1953 Act. I am sure that he will hasten to agree with that simple proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The description of the 1953 Act in clause 4 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"prohibition of carrying of offensive weapons in public".</p></blockquote>
Does this not suggest that the aim was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>544</span>
nothing to do with the follow-up, the moving into a private place or a private party, but that it was specifically concerned with "public place" activity of this kind, so that much of the argument goes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think there is some virtue in that point. We were slightly sidetracked at this point, but I thought it was worth picking up because I am sure that the Under-Secretary would want to link it to suspicion of a 1953 Act offence and not just a general suspicion of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and having welcomed the fact that the Under-Secretary has repudiated the Solicitor-General's more fiery excesses in the previous Committee stage, I turn to the nub of this, and that is the positive definition that he gave of the powers under clause 4 as they have been drafted. I still believe that what he has described is not clearly in the clause as he has it, and there will be great difficulties for the courts in interpreting this clause. I should like to see it put beyond a doubt. I should like to see it put beyond doubt on my side of the argument. I have to say to him—I hope that this will not be thought of as unhelpful for my hon. Friends—that if we lose the argument, I think that the clause does not yet justify what the Under-Secretary is claiming. He should go back to his skilled and expert advisers, who have already jettisoned the word "may", to see whether some other things could not be jettisoned as well or introduced in order to clarify the position. There is a need to have law which is intelligible to everyone as a general principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, with respect to my hon. Friend, we are concerned not only with clarifying the issue; we are concerned with clarifying it in a certain direction. It may be clarified in the other way, which would not be very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I recognise that I have a problem there, fastidious as it may be. But I would rather have clarity than opaque confusion, which is what I fear we may have at the moment. I think I carry all my hon. Friends with me in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine what the Under-Secretary said. He said that we shall not have wide-ranging group searches and there is no question of searching all the occupants of a dance hall merely because there is a generalised suspicion that somewhere in the dance hall there is an offensive weapon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>545</span>
He talked about a small group, and he denned it very helpfully. He talked about three or four people, and that is an extremely interesting limitation. What is more, he made it even more specific. He used a technical term which I hesitate to plunge into but which is perhaps the key to this. He said that the group would not only have to be a small group of three or four people but those people would have to be acting in concert. What he is suggesting there is that they would have to be combined in some sort of way and acting together; they would have to be linked personally together in an enterprise or in a course of action. The distinction which he was making is that if one was not acting in concert with the person on whom suspicion had crystalised one could not be searched merely because one was under the same roof or in the same public place of entertainment or passing in the same street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the important distinction which the Under-Secretary is making is that one can have a group search but the group has to be very small and so tightly knit that the technical legal term "acting in concert" would be able to apply to all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend envisage a small group acting in concert being a picket line in an industrial dispute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dear</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may well want to make a short contribution on that interesting theme in a moment, although I do not want to incite anyone to delay the Committee. I take it that if one was just standing on a picket line one could not be searched. I presume that the Under-Secretary is saying that if there is a report that there are three or four people jumping about at a specific location, acting together, shouting and perhaps attacking someone, and it is thought that there is a knife among them, one might be able to search that small group which was acting in that way. This is quite a helpful concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that we keep referring to a knife. As the 1953 Act is worded, it would appear that the term "offensive weapon" can have a very wide application. Recently at a demonstration in Oldham a person was charged with carrying an offensive weapon which was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
six tomatoes. Does my hon. Friend think that that could happen in a picket line situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely refuse to plunge into the niceties of a definition of an offensive weapon. My hon. Friend will know that there is massive case law on this matter. Section 1(4) of the 1953 Act says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"'offensive weapon' means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use by him."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to speculate but presumably there was circumstantial evidence which a court found persuasive in terms of the conclusion that the person had these tomatoes and intended to use them as an offensive weapon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go on about the tomatoes but it seems to me that the 1953 Act is open to interpretation in various ways because it does not say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"'offensive weapon' means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, and intended by the person".</p></blockquote>
It says "or intended". It seems to me, therefore, that any article which the person intended to use for injury, whether it be a boot, a tin of beans or six tomatoes, can, if he intended to use it, be classified as an offensive weapon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to my hon. Friend is that it does not matter in what context we use the term "offensive weapon", whether it be under the present law under the 1953 Act, whether it be under clause 4 of the Bill as drafted or clause 4 as amended, as I hope, or clause 4 perhaps abolished, if we do not get further concessions, but as long as "offensive weapon" appears in statute it is going to be defined by the courts and that will be an area of difficulty. The courts have been doing it for many years now. I have spent many an ingenious afternoon trying to persuade them that there was a reasonable excuse for carrying an object or that it did not constitute an offensive weapon. No doubt we shall continue to dance on the head of that pin whatever happens in the course of this Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must get back to the main, important theme. We know now that there must be a direct link; there cannot just be a search because someone is in the same dance hall or in the same place as the person on whom suspicion has crystallised. We know that in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>547</span>
order to justify a search in the Under-Secretary's mind it must be a tight group, and they must be acting in concert. This is a very high standard of test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary went a little further—and this is what I want to press. He seemed to indicate that he accepted my basic contention that suspicion had to crystallise on an individual. It seems to me that if we are getting to the stage where the group is so tight that they actually have to be technically acting in concert we are very near the situation in which we are saying that suspicion must crystallise on the individual who is being searched. If the Under-Secretary, having run 10 miles from the extreme views of the Solicitor-General, were to go only a few more feet he would be able to agree with me that in order to search suspicion should crystallise on the individual, and only the individual on whom that suspicion had crystallised should be searched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, as I understand it, was the law up to this point. If the Under-Secretary was prepared to accept that, my fears—I can only speak for myself—about the group search aspect, which I regard as the most controversial part of the Bill, would be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment which I have tabled, which seek to insert "any"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person is carrying an offensive weapon … the constable may search that particular person without warrant"—</p></blockquote>
removes ambiguity. It makes it perfectly clear that it must be suspicion crystallising on 'X' that he is committing an offence under the 1953 Act and then search him. That clarifies the position. I will not refer to a halfway house, because the Under-Secretary has come a lot further than half way from the very extreme position that was maintained by his party in the previous Committee. His position is hovering on the edge of mine to the effect that it really has to be such a tight group that it could be legally argued that the people were acting in concert together in the carrying of the offensive weapon by one. In that situation all he has to do is to accept the amendment. Then I can promise him that he will have no further trouble from me during the rest of the debate on this clause. However, I limit my concession rather hastily. I genuinely say to him that he has done very well today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is too kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>548</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am never too kind to Conservatives. The Under-Secretary has done extremely well today because he has ruled out an enormous number of the excesses that we genuinely feared. Our fears were genuine because they were based on hard black type in the speeches of Conservative Ministers. But he has left ambiguity, and we only have his personal word, his personal interpretation. He may find it almost inconceivable that people would find the Solicitor-General's remarks on the previous Bill more persuasive than his own on this one, but it is a possibility, and we may end up with the worst of any world because the fears will still exist. The fears may in themselves tempt abuse beyond what is envisaged by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman could complete the job, a job which he has started well in terms of his own textual analysis, by accepting this amendment, and then we should have inserted in the Bill in firm, indisputable terms the kind of concession, the kind of sensible limitation, which he has been hinting at throughout his remarks. This would not be a defeat for the Minister, because we would have achieved a new power which got us away from "a public place", away from the need to arrest, away from the caveats and the reservations, the cribbing and confining terms of section 1(3) of the 1953 Act. We would have on the statute book a simple, unambiguous right where suspicion has centred on a person, with a minimum of fuss to search him on the spot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the Conservative point of view that would be a considerable advance, and I would be prepared to go along with that. It would also clearly rule out the kind of group searches and excesses which everyone has been reading into these clauses and which we gather from the Under-Secretary have been much exaggerated. So he has a chance to gain a considerable victory from his personal point of view and to reassure hon. Members on this side and the general public, and to leave the law in a situation where it is not ambiguous and open to misinterpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in his intervention sought to alarm the people of Scotland by suggesting that random power of searches for tomatoes would be permitted as a provision of this clause. I am

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>549</span>
happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that that will not be the case, despite his fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) appeared at one stage almost to be making an offer which I find it difficult to refuse, when he appeared to suggest that he would support the rest of the Bill in exchange for a concession on this clause. I make the following brief points to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the degree of suspicion for the creation of an offence was related to the offence under the 1953 Act. I must stress that no new offence is created by clause 4(1) of this Bill. All it does is give a power to search where there is suspicion that an offence has been committed under the 1953 Act. It in no way alters the level of proof that must be satisfied before an offence under the 1953 Act has been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a number of references to the remarks made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) during the debate on the previous Government's Bill over a year ago. In particular, he made reference to the suggestion that it might be appropriate to have powers for random search of everyone in a dance hall. In commenting on that, it is debatable whether that would have been possible ever under the amendment being considered at that time. That is the debatable point at issue. But I made clear the Government's position that we are not talking about random searches of people in dance halls or in any other public place of a kind comparable to a dance hall. We are talking about reasonable suspicion that the person being searched is carrying a weapon at the time in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman slightly stretched what I said. I did not say, when dealing with a small group of people, that they must be acting in concert before the powers under the clause could be used. I said that there has to be a close link between them. For example, where they were acting in concert there would obviously be such a close link, but I certainly would not want to suggest that only if the courts were satisfied that the people had been acting in concert, which is a technical term which requires a very high degree of common criminal purpose, would the police have power to search more than one person at a particular time. What I was anxious to distinguish, and I am still
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>550</span>
anxious to distinguish, is where on the one hand there is a group of people who, although they are in the same room or the same building, have no particular relationship with one another as opposed to a small group of people who do have a very close link with one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, there may be a gang which at the time in question may not be acting in concert so far as the possession of an offensive weapon is concerned. There may be a gang most of whom at the end of the day may be shown not to have known that one of the members had a knife in his possession. Nevertheless, if they are a gang or a small group and the police know that they have a weapon between them, in such a situation it certainly would be the Government's intention that, in that limited set of circumstances, even if the technical concept of acting in concert may not be able to be proved, the police should have the power to search each member of that gang or of that small group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman stressed that he would be content if I could give an assurance that before the police could use these powers their suspicion would have to have crystallise on to an individual I can certainly say that the Government's desire in terms of this clause is that before the police use this power their suspicion should have crystallised on an individual or individuals; otherwise it would be impossible to go beyond a single individual. I freely accept that it is necessary, and should be necessary, for the police to have reasonable cause to believe that each and every person whom they search might be the person actually carrying the weapon. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition, otherwise we would be talking about a form of random search, and that is not the Government's intention and not what the clause provides. So the police must have their suspicion crystallised on an individual or individuals whom they propose to search before the power would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is trying to be helpful. What is wrong with the amendment that we discussed in that case? It is exactly trying to say that. If the position is that suspicion must have crystallised on each person who is searched—and that seems to be an interesting and helpful limitation of this power—there is nothing in the amendment which strikes at that. Indeed, it underlines it. It helps the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>551</span>
Minister by writing specifically and clearly into the statute what his intentions are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is either superfluous or obnoxious. If it merely says what the clause already says it would clearly be unnecessary to add it to the clause. If, however, the hon. Gentleman wishes to change what he believes to be the present meaning of the clause, I have to tell him that I am advised that he is incorrect on that. What we are talking about at this stage is drafting. What I think the hon. Member for Garscadden is saying is that what he accepts now as a reasonable objective and what he understands to be the Government's objective are very much in harmony one with the other, but that he is unhappy that the clause in its present form would actually meet that requirement. I am advised—I have checked this again—that those who have drafted the detailed wording of the clause are satisfied that it would have the effect that I have described to the Committee. I am happy to have further consideration of that matter, but I should not be willing to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment because either I am right, in which case the amendment is unnecessary, or it would have the effect of changing the clause into a more restrictive nature, which would not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of real moment. The Under-Secretary is aware how many fears have been expressed, often by groups who have no axe to grind, and the widespread belief that this is a random power of search—random in the sense that it can involve the searching of people on whom suspicion has not crystallised, people who just happen to be there—is not assuaged by the wording of clause 4. Will he undertake at least, if he does not like my wording, to see whether it is possible to get some wording which would put his present intention clearly on the face of the statute: in other words, no one can be searched unless reasonable suspicion of an offence under the 1953 Act has crystallised on that person? That is what I am trying to do with the amendments. As I understand it, that is the intention of the Under-Secretary. It is clearly not the understanding of most people who have read clause 4 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the concern of groups who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>552</span>
have no axe to grind. It seems a particularly appropriate phrase to use when we are dealing with this clause. I have indicated today what the Government's intention is. I am certainly happy to give an undertaking to look at the present drafting of the clause, and if it is our view that the present drafting would not achieve that effect, an amendment of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned or some other amendment may be appropriate. But I am advised that the drafting would meet the situation that I have described to the Committee. We will look at that matter further because we have opportunity to do so, but that is the Government's intention. If we find that the drafting is not satisfactory, there will be opportunity to amend it at a subsequent stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to intervene, but, clearly, the Committee is in some difficulty. We shall be in greater difficulty if the Government do not table an amendment on Report to deal with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is making. I make the technical point about the selection of amendments on Report. It is an open secret that on Report the Opposition will be seeking the deletion of the clause. Against that background, if the Under-Secretary, as he seems to be doing, accepts the argument which has been put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden that there is some defect in the drafting, surely there is an obligation on the Government to table an amendment to a clause which they themselves will be hoping to sustain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stress to the hon. Gentleman that I do not accept that there is anything wrong with the drafting of the cluase. I specifically said to the hon. Member for Garscadden that I am advised that the drafting of the clause in its present form meets the objectives of the Government as indicated by me in my comments to the Committee this morning. Naturally, I do not wish to say that that is a matter which cannot be considered further. I am happy to look at the drafting, and if we find on further consideration that the wording is defective, clearly we shall want to amend it to meet the Government's intention. I am happy to say to the hon. Gentleman that, when we have finally come to a decision on the matter before the Report stage, we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>553</span>
shall let the hon. Member for Garscadden and the hon. Gentleman who speaks for the Opposition know our conclusions on this matter to give them time to put forward their own amendment if we feel that one is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise two things today. First, the Government's intention is that there should not be random powers of search; secondly, where more than one person may be being searched at a particular time, it is necessary for the police to have reasonable suspicion that each person whom they search may be the person who is carrying the weapon at the time in question. That is the Government's objective. I believe that the present drafting provides for that, but, because of the concern expressed by the Opposition, we will look at it again and let the Opposition know our conclusions on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make one brief point in relation to that before my hon. Friend decides what we should do on this amendment. The Under-Secretary said that the amendment was either objectionable or superfluous, and, clearly, his concern is that it is superfluous, because he has now come to the point where he is saying that he is agreeing with my hon. Friend on the basic view on this. With repsect, it is the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends who have moved on this, and we are very pleased that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem is that, if the amendment is withdrawn and the Minister decides to stand by his view that it is superfluous, only if he himself brings forward an amendment can it be discussed on Report. It may be that, because of guillotining or other problems or the fact that we have discussed it at length here, such an amendment on our part might not be taken If the objection is that the words are only superfluous—and there are only two words involved: "one" in line 26 and "particular" in line 29—there is absolutely no reason why the Government, if they mean what they say, should not accept this amendment. If on consideration they feel that this could be clarified better, they could come up themselves on Report with their own re-definition. This would satisfy anxieties, and even honour would be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>554</span>
circumstances. It is not an unreasonable position to take. The Government believe that the present wording meets the desired objectives but they offer to consider the matter further. It is for others than the Government to decide which amendments are ultimately selected on Report but, no doubt, those who do the selecting will read the debate, and will know the circumstances in which an amendment was withdrawn, if it is withdrawn, and will be able to take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not simply arguing that the hon. Gentleman's amendment is superfluous. I am saying that it is either superfluous or objectionable. It may very well be that his amendment would have a more restrictive effect than the Government intend. I cannot be certain on that but I am not agreeing to writing into a Bill at this stage words which may have an effect contrary to the Government's intention. The whole point of Report stage is to deal with matters of this kind, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be unreasonable about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I regard this as not a bad morning's work. We have come a long way from what I understood to be the Government's position when we walked into this room. I am very happy to hear so definitively and authoritatively from the Under-Secretary that under this caluse no one can be searched unless reasonable suspicion that he is carrying an offensive weapon centres on him; there can be no guilt by association or guilt by random chance of being in a certain place, or guilt just because he is caught in a police net at a particular investigation. These are very important concessions in my view, and in no mean spirit I say that I welcome them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. It leaves me in a very different position as far as the "clause stand part" debate is concerned. I am not saying that I do not have a lot of reservations still, but if we can administer this law in practice in the streets as has been outlined by the Under-Secretary—and that is something we may want to discuss—it obviously removes one real area of anxiety for me personally. I speak only for myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Under-Secretary will have a close look at this before Report. We have reached an important area of agreement in terms of the operation of the clause. I am not sure that that agreement is widely understood, and I think the words

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>555</span>
of the statute should be looked at again, and I am not convinced that my amendment would not be helpful in achieving that aim. But, in view of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 4, line 35, leave out from 'above' to end of line 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be delighted to hear, Mr. Gourlay, that I can be extremely brief on this amendment. It is not even a probing amendment. It is, 	<i>mea culpa,</i> a case of not understanding what it is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point was raised, I think, by the Law Society, or it may have been the Glasgow Bar Association, but it was one of the reasonably well-informed briefs that we have received in this Committee. I shared the doubt as to exactly what was intended by the words which the amendment would attempt to remove. The Under-Secretary will see that it seeks to takeout:
	<br><blockquote><p>"conceals from a constable acting in the exercise of the said powers an offensive weapon".</p></blockquote>
I just wonder why it is necessary at all. It seems to be slightly redundant, and there have been suggestions in at least one of the briefs that it may be trying to create a separate offence, and it might create an atmosphere of double jeopardy in the clause. Perhaps the Under-Secretary could explain exactly why it is necessary and, if it is necessary, I can take up the point again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I give, as an example, the sort of situation where this would be relevant. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is often a situation with a small group of people, both male and female. A youth who it is known is going to be searched by the police passes the knife to his girl friend, who conceals it in her handbag. She is not the person who is being searched but she has, voluntarily and knowingly, taken part in an attempt to obstruct the police in the carrying out of this provision. It is that sort of circumstance that we have in mind, where not only the person who is being searched may be obstructive but a friend, including a girl friend, might, knowingly and deliberately,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>556</span>
seek to obstruct in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is by no means unusual in these circumstances, and it is that sort of situation which this subsection is meant to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps this could be taken almost as an intervention in the Under-Secretary's remarks. The difficulty about it is that it is creating a separate offence of intentionally obstructing a constable and concealing from a constable an offensive weapon, as distinct from possessing an offensive weapon, which is clearly an offence anyway. There is an element of overkill in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More specifically, we have the new offence of intentionally obstructing a constable in the exercise of the constable's powers. I would have thought that that would have very adequately covered the kind of circumstances which the Under-Secretary has described. The difficulty about para (	<i>b</i>) is that on first reading it might suggest that just shoving it up one's jumper would in itself be an offence in addition to possessing an offensive weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances seem to me to be totally covered by obstruction, and just to conceal is very common. A youth is walking along with what is thought to be an offensive weapon. That is an offence. He then conceals it about his person because he hears the police car approaching—too late, because he has been seen but he does not know that. That might be taken to be a second offence, attracting a fine not exceeding £200 under subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>). But it does not seem to me that we need subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) and it might be open to misinterpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply a question of concealing the weapon that would be the offence. It is concealing the weapon from a constable; in other words, the fact that before the constable arrived the weapon was hidden in a boot or in a handbag or amongst clothing would not in itself be the extra offence, as the hon. Gentleman has referred to it. In order for the additional matter to be relevant there has to be evidence that the individual concerned has concealed it from the constable, which is a deliberate matter and a separate matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are envisaging a situation where, when the search is about to begin, the knife, which may be in the individual's hand under his jacket, is surreptitiously
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>557</span>
passed to a girl friend, who slips it into her handbag. That is known to happen regularly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it does, but, leaving aside for the moment the question, on which we might want to hear something in a moment, whether this should be an offence at all, surely it is covered by any person who:
	<br><blockquote><p>"intentionally obstructs a constable in the exercise of the constable's powers under subsection (1)".</p></blockquote>
This, clearly, is obstructing the constable in the exercise of his powers if the individual tries to smuggle it away to a third party who slips it into her handbag, or anything like that. Therefore, subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) is redundant, and it is open to interpretation, 	<i>prima facie,</i> that it is an additional offence merely to hide it because the police are coming. That would be double jeopardy, it seems to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>) is obstructing a constable; that means, trying to prevent him searching the individual concerned. The only power that the police have is not a power to find the weapon but the power to search for it. This is clearly the case. For clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>) to be relevant there is a requirement that the person has to have obstructed the constable in the exercise of his powers. His powers are to search, and if he is prevented from searching, that may be relevant to clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not concerned with a person who prevents a constable searching the individual; we are concerned with a person who frustrates the whole purpose of the search by concealing the object for which the constable is searching. We are dealing with two different sets of circumstances, and, therefore, it is necessary to have the alternative—and it is an alternative—to deal satisfactorily with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the more I hear of the clause the less I like it. I am not sure that double jeopardy is the problem here; it is much more likely that this will spill over into the random situation which the Minister says he is trying to avoid. I do not know how we are to make this kind of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that if there is a signal that a police car is coming and the weapon is hidden under a cushion and it is then discovered, this is not an offence under clause 4(2)(	<i>b</i>), according to the Minister.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>558</span>
He says it is an offence if, after the constable has arrived and the search has started, I then pass to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) my knobkerrie, or whatever it is that I sometimes feel I need to use on the heads of Government Ministers. Only at that point does it become an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is precisely the situation with which we are concerned. It is precisely the confrontation situation between the constable and young people that we are concerned with. This seems to me to expand the problem involving those round about. For example, if the knife is being passed around, is everyone else then searched? How wide will the group be to come under the first subsection? This is extending it again. The whole thing involves this confrontation and conflict situation and moves away from my hon. Friend's first amendment of the position of the individual here. I do not think it is necessarily double jeopardy; the trouble is that it is treble jeopardy. It also brings in the other people who are involved as well as the individual himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole clause is bad. This subsection should be removed. It is open to all the ambiguities that the clause was supposed to prevent in the 1953 Act. It creates ambiguities, and, because it creates ambiguities, it creates conflict. It should be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must support my hon. Friends on this amendment, the more so as I have heard the arguments. There is a double jeopardy involved as the clause is at present worded, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has stated. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"conceals from a constable acting in the exercise of the said powers".</p></blockquote>
It does not say "concealed by giving to another person", by putting it somewhere else, by throwing it in the river or throwing it over a fence, or whatever it might be. It says "conceals". This is exactly what the clause is about; it is about concealment and the right of a constable to search.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, if a person is carrying a knife in his hand there is no need to search him. It is only if he conceals it in some way that one has to search. That is what the clause is about. So why is it an offence, as it is at present worded, to conceal it, as well as being an offence to carry it? In other words, there is a situation where the person could be charged, in a sense, twice. First, as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>559</span>
constable comes along he tucks it into his inside pocket. That could be taken, as the clause reads at present, to mean that he is concealing it from the constable. The constable sees him concealing it; he then uses his power under the clause to search the person, he finds the offensive weapon, and then charges him again, with the offence of actually carrying an offensive weapon. The person could thus be charged twice for what is essentially the same offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Minister would at least be prepared to look at the wording and introduce an amendment on Report which reads something like "conceals off his person", or whatever it might be, or "attempts to give to another person", in some way which gets rid of this ambiguity. There is the problem that there could be double jeopardy here, as my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), that it is not just about double jeopardy. There is the fact that it brings us into the situation, as the Minister described it, of almost random searching of a large number of people within the gang situation if a knife, or whatever offensive weapon it was, was being passed round. That means not only that the person who eventually finishes up with the offensive weapon and is actually searched and charged by the policeman, but every person in that gang could in theory be charged with concealing it because it is being passed from one to the other behind their backs, and the constable charges each one in turn with concealing it. In other words, the constable is not charging only one person with being in possession of an offensive weapon; he may be charging 10 or 12 people with another offence as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member say what is objectionable in terms of public policy that if three or four members of a gang behave in exactly this way, passing a knife from one to another, they should be charged with an offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that it immediately comes into the situation of random searching. That is what we find offensive. The constable cannot be certain who has got the weapon, to whom it has and has not been passed, in a large number of people. He may search them all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of clause 4(2)(	<i>b</i>) the police do not have to search anyone. If there is sufficient evidence to justify a charge that someone has been concealing the weapon, that is all that they need to do. If those concerned are passing the knife from one to the other, there is no need to search in order to prove anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again that opens the question, because the knife might not be in the possession of any of them by that time. The constable can then charge all of them, if he has reasonable grounds. The constable will be charging one person with carrying an offensive weapon, or searching one person. If the weapon has been thrown away completely, it may be that he can search them all, and if he still has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was a weapon, he may still charge, even though no weapon has been found. Is that possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly possible if the constable has evidence, and if the court is satisfied that the evidence proves what is charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. Of course the courts will be those who eventually decide. One of the things that worry us throughout this is what "reasonable grounds for suspecting" means. I will, however, leave it where it will perhaps be wiser for me to leave it on the point of double jeopardy, and ask the Minister if he would take up that point in particular on the wording as it stands. It seems to me open to a double interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the general point, there is ample precedent for having not only a substantive offence but an offence of obstructing a constable in the exercise of his duty. The normal practice is that, even in certain circumstances where both might have actually happened, it is by no means automatic that the person will be charged with both. That is a matter of prosecution policy. Often the prosecuting authorities, and indeed the court, would concentrate only on the more substantive and more serious offence. There is no new principle introduced by the clause. I think the hon. Member for Garscadden would appreciate that there is often a double provision which can be used, but which is not automatically used, depending on the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not very convinced. I think that this is redundant. We are not trying to take out subsection (2) altogether; it is merely paragraph (	<i>b</i>) within it that we are trying to remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision seems to me to be essentially unnecessary. I accept that the Minister made a distinction between obstructing a constable in the exercise of his powers and concealing. I see that distinction, but I am not sure that it is one which is necessarily found in the words. It would be perfectly possible to say that, although obstructing is often meant in terms of physically struggling and obstructing a constable in the course of his duty, obstructing can also mean concealing, doing away with evidence, and so on. So, although I accept that there may be a distinction that one could try to make, I do not think it is a valid distinction. I would have thought that the word "obstruct" would have taken in almost any of the activities which the Minister has described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend be prepared to accept an example of obstructing a constable of which I have seen cases? That is where a speed trap is in operation and people coming the other way flash their lights at the cars going towards the speed trap to warn them. Those drivers have actually been charged with obstructing the police in the course of their duty. That is not stopping the police in any physical sense: it is simply obstructing the police, and that is what they are charged with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, a very deplorable activity—said he, mendaciously. As far as I am concerned, the word "obstruct" could certainly do for all arguments the Minister has advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important point on which my hon. Friends have stumbled. I do not think that there will be any case for random searches arising from this, and I would certainly hope that there would not be. Presumably, if we take the Minister's definition, which we have just had explained so fully in the last debate, that there must be suspicion crystallising on someone before there can be a search under the clause, it presumably would not be sufficient merely to say "I had suspicion of 'X'. I have acted upon that reasonable suspicion, and I have searched 'X'. 'X'
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
turns out not to have a knife. My reasonable suspicion is, therefore, not justified. But, because my reasonable suspicion is not justified, it creates a reasonable suspicion that he must have passed it to someone else, and I shall proceed to search the other members of the group."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the Minister would hasten to agree with me that that would not be proper. When a suspicion has crystallised on "X" and the search is negative, that is the end of the matter. The only way that there could then be a search of other members of the group or a charge under this subsection on other members of the group would be if there had been a visible sighting of the passing or an account from someone of the passing which would justify a different set of circumstances: that is, an arrest on the grounds of this totally separate offence which is outlined in subsection 2(	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I can give the hon. Gentleman such an assurance. Whether there is reasonable suspicion is dependent upon what is relevant at the time in question. There is no requirement under the clause that the only time when the reasonable suspicion is relevant is at the very beginning, before the constable searches anyone at all. If he searches one person and does not find a knife, or if some other circumstance changes and the constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that another individual is carrying a knife, he is perfectly entitled to search that other individual. The only relevant question is whether the police constable, at the time any individual is searched, has reasonable suspicion to believe that that individual is carrying a knife. As long as that reasonable suspicion exists at the time the person is searched, that is the relevant consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a great compromiser. In fact, I am getting quite a bad reputation on these Benches for looking for compromises. Perhaps we can look for a compromise here. Would the Minister accept that at least there could be circumstances in which a search could not follow from an unsuccessful search of Mr. "X"? In other words, if the only possible ground of suspicion attaching to the other people in the group was a failure to find anything on Mr. X, I do not see how it could possibly be said that there was reasonable suspicion to justify a search.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>563</span>
I could envisage a circumstance in which a person had actually seen X with a knife in his hand as he came blowing up from 50 yards away and grabbed him but found nothing. Then he might have reasonable suspicion, because he had actually seen X with a knife, which he had passed to someone else. That might arguably create the circumstance which the Under-Secretary has outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it would be monstrous and wrong—I hope I shall have an assurance on this—to say that merely because nothing has been found on X, then B, C, D, and E will be searched because they were in proximity. At least on that can we not agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can certainly agree that the simple fact that the police have not found a knife on the first individual they search does not automatically give them a right, nor should it give them a right, to search anybody else in the vicinity. We go back to our previous discussion, where if there is a group of people who are a gang or who may be acting in concert or where there is a close link between them, in these circumstances if the suspicion of the police has crystallised on an individual or individuals—I specially made that additional reference "or individuals"—and they have reasonable cause, the power of search should be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>on the narrow point of subsection 2(	<i>b</i>)—not as far as I would like, but at least he is agreeing that there is no automatic right to search merely because one has failed to find on the first search the reasonable object of suspicion.</p>
	<p>I hold to the point that this is a redundant provision. If one finds the weapon on someone else, I do not see that the £200 fine is needed, because if it is found on someone else, he is carrying an offensive weapon and one has the power under the 1953 Act by definition. Similarly, if the person conceals the weapon by throwing it behind a hedge, if one can prove by evidence having seen it in his possession and the fact that it has been found within a few yards of him just as the police arrived, one has got him as well under the 1953 Act, and this additional power of the £200 fine under clause 4(2) is not needed.</p>
	<p>So it seems to me that in almost all circumstances the provision is redundant, and I think that, given the choice, the authorities would go for the 1953 Act prosecution, which has a wider range of penalties which might make it attractive.</p>
	<p>In any event, it seems to me that the provision is unnecessary as well as redundant. Therefore I think that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) should be removed.</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The provisions of section 4 of this Act will have effect from a period of five years from the date of any commencement order made in respect of it under section 81(2) below and shall then expire unless Parliament by affirmative resolution of both Houses otherwise determines.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take new clause 2—	<i>Duration of ss. 1 to 3.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the origin of this matter is within the knowledge of the Committee. The Scottish Council on Crime set up by the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1972, now Lord Campbell of Cray, in the report published in 1975 made a recommendation that these stop and search powers should be increased. But all the recommendations, which are contained in paragraphs 82 to 90, are hedged with uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In almost every paragraph some doubt is expressed about whether the stop and search powers would be useful. In paragraph 90 the Scottish Council on Crime says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that the weight of the arguments is in favour of the granting to the police of a power of search of persons in public places for offensive weapons. In addition we consider that there would be considerable advantage in the statutory power of search being introduced for a trial period of perhaps five years which would enable the effectiveness of the power for the reduction of crimes of violence and its effect on police-public relationships to be assessed."</p></blockquote>
What worries the Opposition is the degree of certainty with which the clause has been introduced and supported by the Government. We have seen the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) change his views. When I saw him carry a massive armful of papers into the Committee this morning, I was absolutely certain that this was the day of confession and we would all be advised that he had changed his mind compared with his much more enlightened days with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
Scottish Council for Civil Liberties and the evidence he gave on behalf of that council to the Thomson Committee and various other groups. It may well be that, even before one o'clock, the silent senator from South Angus will break his silence to date and we shall be able to tempt him into giving us just a few brief words of wisdom about why he has changed his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seriously doubt whether the people who made up the Scottish Council on Crime—a quango set up by the Tory Government which was not renewed by the Labour Government when they came to power—have changed their minds, because there is absolutely no doubt that there is a great deal of doubt—if that is not a confusing statement to make—about whether the clause would be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 87 and new clause 2 is to give time for second thoughts five years after the introduction of this power. I can give a commitment on behalf of the Labour Government that in five years' time we would willingly come back to the House under the obligation that the amendment and new clause 2 would place on that new Labour Government and make a report to the House at that stage about the effectiveness of the stop and search powers. We would follow the procedure laid down in amendment 87. We would place before the House affirmative resolutions either to renew or not to renew the powers. Certainly the powers should lapse after five years, in order that Parliament itself should have time to consider the effectiveness of the powers. No doubt we shall come to this in the "clause stand part" debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right through the Scottish Council on Crime's report on this subject, and its recommendations on this aspect of the report, there is a great deal of uncertainty. There is not one paragraph between paragraphs 82 and 89 where the Scottish Council on Crime shows any degree of certainty about whether the powers will be effective in the way that many people seem to think they will. From our point of view and, I hope, from that of the Minister, the Government and hon. Members on the Government side, it would be sensible to have a trial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come to another point in the debate on "clause stand part", but I give the Minister advance warning so that, when we come to that debate, he may have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>567</span>
a reasonable explanation ready for us on the possibility of a massive publicity campaign in Scotland about the introduction of these new powers. While it is an aside at the moment, that was one more recommendation from the Scottish Council on Crime about which we have heard absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, we are discussing whether the powers should be introduced for a limited period, as the Scottish Council on Crime has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt when the Minister replies he will want to explain to the Committee why it was felt necessary to ignore the suggestion from the Scottish Council on Crime that this new power, which the Council itself described as a very wide-ranging power—these are not my words, but are contained in the report of the Council—created the uncertainty in the minds of the Scottish Council on Crime and led it to make the suggestion that the powers should be introduced for a trial period of five years only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other point at this stage is one which hon. Members on the Government side must by now be becoming tired of hearing me make, the need to create some confidence in this legislation. I shall go on making it until I see signs in the Government that they themselves have a desire to create some confidence in their own legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one aspect of the Bill that has created a great deal of apprehension. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) had the humiliating experience of trying to prosecute this case on Scottish television, even among the young Conservative lawyers on that panel. If he wants me to quote from some of the letters that I have had from his young Conservative friends I shall willingly do so. The chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland should be very careful that I do not further embarrass him, when we come to a later stage of the Bill, by quoting from some of the letters I have received from those over whom he is chairman. They are an unruly bunch, and he is not doing much to control them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South had the humiliating experience of trying to prosecute this case on BBC television. Here we had an example of an advocate at the highest level of the law in Scotland not only being out-smarted, not only being out-argued, but being roundly defeated by a solicitor—a junior member of the legal profession. I know that the faculty is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
still reeling from the wounds that were inflicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend ought to be fair and recognise that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was suffering from the appalling handicap of having a jury which represented a normal intelligent cross-section of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is interesting but I should like to know how closely it is related to the amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is related to the amendment, Mr. Gourlay, because the jury of young lawyers, or young people who were training to be lawyers, in five years' time will be in a very good position to judge whether this provision has been a success. It is fairly obvious that, with the failure of the chairman of the Tory Party in Edinburgh to convince some of his own colleagues that there were great doubts about this, the doubts are there indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the serious point that it is rather surprising that the Government have introduced the clause with a degree of certainty which does not seem justified. Even those who are in favour of the clause are rather doubtful about its contents and effectiveness. Our worry is where on earth the Government got this degree of certainty which does not seem justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be interested to hear what the Minister says. He has been very reasonable this morning, and we hope that we can take him a further step along the reasonable road that he has trodden well and get him to accept that we have here a reasonable proposition, that it has no insidious undertones and that, assuming that the Bill goes on the statute book and becomes effective towards the end of this year or the beginning of 1981, the only effect of the amendment and the new clause would be in 1986. Surely it is a reasonable proposition to give Parliament in 1986 a chance to have a second look at what the Scottish Council on Crime describes as very wide-ranging and sweeping powers of stop and search.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall be able to take the Minister a further step along the reasonable road that he has trod well this morning, and that he will be prepared to accept our proposal as doing two things. First, it gives us time for second thoughts in five
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>569</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to speak in this debate, but, in the absence of the man who says those lines, I feel obliged to open with that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Harry Ewing) is a reasonable proposition that when the Government are making fundamental changes to the legal process, these should be tested. If the Government succeed in getting this provision on the statute book, it is not unreasonable that we should ask, as the amendment does, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of section 4 of this Act will have effect from a period of five years from the date of any commencement order made in respect of it under section 81(2) below and shall then expire unless Parliament by affirmative resolution of both Houses otherwise determines."</p></blockquote>
Yesterday I had the honour and privilege to attend the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, along with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). Commissioners were demanding of the convener of the Church and Nation Committee that the church declare its view on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill—and this is what was said by one commissioner—because of the public interest in the increased powers of the police which would exist if this became law. Clause 4, of course, is central to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have gone between this House and Scotland in recent weeks and as I have undertaken our public meetings and debates in a multitude of organisations, as is my practice, I am struck by the fact that people of a very wide range of interests and concerns are raising matters pertaining to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Yesterday was just another case in point when this was raised in the General Assembly. I think we should make an assessment of the effectiveness of any serious and radical change to the law, and this Bill is exactly that. I should want us to make the assessment of its effectiveness and of its social impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before in the Committee, and my hon. Friends have made the same point, that we believe that police/community relations will deteriorate as a consequence of this measure. If we were to adopt the amendment, if the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
were willing to accept the additional words that my hon. Friends seek to introduce, at the end of that five years the next Labour Government and the next Secretary of State for Scotland could make an assessment by gathering information from people who are likely to be informed about the impact on police/community relations. I have in mind social workers. Perhaps the British Association of Social Workers could make an informed assessment. I think that the probation officers would be very interested in advising the Government of the day of their view, and I would certainly be interested to hear what the police themselves had to say about the effectiveness and the impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Member's argument very closely. Where in Scotland would anybody find probation officers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Social Work (Scotland) Act created a generic social worker. I am happy to discuss that for 10 minutes or so because I was very closely involved with the reorganisation of social work in Scotland. Even if we have the generic social work principle introduced in Scotland, we still have people who have to do the job of probation work. There are still in Scotland members of the National Association of Probation Officers, known as NAPO. They have already commented on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) reminds me of that. I would see the National Association of Probation Officers doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who is a justice of the peace, has finally made a contribution. Even if it was not particularly enlightening and did not add any new information to what we were discussing, nonetheless we are delighted that he intervened, because it shows that he is alive and well sitting over there under Queen Victoria's portrait.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is important to get an assessment from informed sources. I think that in the space of five years the then Labour Secretary of State for Scotland would want to hear from the police, from the Police Federation—I would hope that it would be able to tell us how it had found the operation of this clause—and from the legal profession. It may not seem so, but there is a large legal profession outside this House and this Committee, although it is very well represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. There is only one Labour Party, and I represent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to continue with the point of the assessment that can be made in five years' time by the next Labour Government. If we adopt the clause it will add to public confidence in the measure. To make a serious point to the Government, and to the Under-Secretary in particular, it is important that we make an assessment, it is important that we find out whether these measures are effective and, most important of all, we must establish the social impact of what the Bill does, particularly with relation to clause 4. That is why I am supporting my learned Friends the hon. Members for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth and Garscadden, who have tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fairly briefly, I would remind the Committee that we are discussing an amendment and new clause. New clause 2, as well as putting in the five-year provision, the five-year life cycle, on clause 4, would extend the same provision to clauses 1, 2 and 3. We do not need to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>572</span>
labour this matter, but there is virtue in doing this for all the really controversial clauses in this part of the Bill. If it is right—I believe it is right for the reasons that have been very cogently advanced by my learned Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg)—that we should have a review after five years on the powers of search, it is equally important that we should have a similar provision for the powers of detention.—This seems to be such a reasonable proposition that I await the Minister's reply with some interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already heard the Solicitor-General for Scotland on the subject. I was originally invited to interview him on STV but, for some reason, that could not take place, and we ended up, like corralled beasts, at either end of the studio. But that gave me the opportunity of hearing what the Solicitor-General was saying. It was specifically put to him that we should have this five-year provision in line with the recommendation of the Scottish Council on Crime. He said that that was quite wrong. He did not give any very good reasons; he said it was not a proper way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure why it is not a proper way to legislate. There is, of course, a very obvious precedent in the Private Member's world, but it is still central to the same field of activity that we are discussing at the moment, and that was the five-year provision on the law abolishing the death penalty. This is quite proper. Although I took the view very seriously that the death penalty should be abolished, I certainly would not have opposed that provision at that time because I recognised that it was a matter of widespread concern in the country and I believed that it was right that there should be built in a positive review after five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it seems to me that, whatever the merits—and let us not discuss the merits at the moment—there is a good deal of disquiet in very broad sections of the community at the moment about the introduction of the power of detention and the introduction of the new powers of search. In those circumstances, it is right that we should have the positive merit of a review in five years. The inertia of legislation is very considerable, and unless we have a positive mandatory need to review, it is extremely difficult to obtain a positive review without that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that people will want to look very closely at how these clauses
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>573</span>
are operating. The existence of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) was drawn forcibly to our attention by his recent intervention, and I was reminded by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East, that the hon. Member is a justice of the peace, and so he will perhaps know that there is widespread concern among justices of the peace. I do not know what happens in Argyll, but I have seen the minutes of one of the occasional meetings of the justices of the peace in the Glasgow district, and they certainly have given very due consideration to this Bill. I came to the conclusion that they had the widest reservations, as people who sat regularly on the Bench, about clause 4 and, I believe, clause 2, but specifically clause 4, and I am sure that they would want the right of review after five years, even if the serried, disciplined ranks of the Government were thoughtlessly to plough on to the statute book without amendment all these propositions as they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has given us today a thoughtful and, on balance, helpful interpretation of clause 4, but he would be the first to say that his words, although they may be persuasive, cannot bind the courts, and they cannot, it seems to me, necessarily bind police practice. I hope, however, that some of the helpful things that he has said will be listened to carefully by the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly what is implied in these clauses is, however, a matter of interpretation and a matter of doubt. Given that confusion, we ought to say that we should have a monitoring process for five years if we are to have it at all, and at the end let us come back and ask "Has it been justified? Have the fears been totally illusory? Has there been a big decline in the use or the carrying of offensive weapons?" These are all matters which in five years' time could usefully, helpfully and properly be canvassed. I would certainly not be above eating humble-pie if some of the fears that I have expressed during the Committee stage turned out to be totally baseless. I give the Under-Secretary the credit of thinking that if he were still in that position—obviously, I hope he will not be—in five years' time, no doubt he himself would take a similarly open-minded approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not striking at all at the merits of the Bill at the moment. We are merely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
writing in a perfectly simple, straightforward commonsense safeguard which should commend itself to everyone involved in this argument, given the heat and controversy that has been generated. The worst that would happen is that we might be saddled with a debate on Scottish criminal procedure in five years' time that we might otherwise not have had. I think that there is positive virtue in every now and then debating criminal procedure. Perhaps we lose sight of it too often between major splurges of legislation of the kind we are having at the moment. In five years' time we may not have the equivalent of a Thomson committee report lying on our desks. It may have dropped somewhat from sight. Positively to have to bring it before the House to discuss how things are going is an admirable principle, and would justify the amendment on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will have a friendly reception, and that the Under-Secretary, recognising that this is not a matter of party principle—it does not represent dogma or a Conservative approach to penology—will say "Fair enough. Let us write this in, and in five years' time we can all in an open-minded way assess the results of the work we have been doing in the Committee." If it should be done for clause 4, it should be done for 1, 2 and 3, which are on the powers of detention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment proposes that the powers of search under clause 4, in the hon. Gentleman's amendment, and other controversial clauses should run only for a trial period. He and others have correctly pointed out that there is very little precedent for any aspect of the criminal law's being determined in this way. The only example that has been quoted to the Committee this morning was the abolition of the death penalty provision, and both sides of the Committee will have no difficulty in concluding that that trial period in no way concluded the argument and debate about the desirability of the death penalty. The debate has continued to this very date. All that was abundantly clear at the end of the trial period was that opinion was as divided as before, and that no conclusive evidence for those who were strongly of one persuasion or the other had been held to have been resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not depreciate in any way the fact that Parliament always has the power, whether or not a trial period is inserted in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
legislation, to reverse the decisions it has previously taken. I was interested by the observations of the Opposition spokesman and the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), who were anxious to assure us that there would be a Labour Government in five years' time. If they are so convinced that there will be a Labour Government in five years' time, what are they worrying about? A Labour Government with a majority can easily remove these powers if they think they are inappropriate. It seemed rather a reflection on their self-confidence on that matter than they were anxious to write this into the Bill—just in case they turned out to be wrong and there was still a Conservative Administration at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the recommendations of the Scottish Council on Crime. Those who have read that chapter will appreciate, as I think no one will dispute, that the question of a trial period was by no means an integral part of the recommendation. No reference to a trial period was made until the final sentence, and it is abundantly clear from reading it that the council put it in as an additional recommendation. In any event, it is not one which the Thomson committee itself thought particularly attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with very great interest to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who argued that the Government should accept the amendment because, to use his own words, it was patently reasonable, it was a commonsense approach to these matters, and there could not possibly be an argument against a proposal of this kind. That was the argument which he put, but on this one occasion he did not follow the precedent he has followed on so many other amendments which the Committee has considered, of quoting what various people said in discussions of similar issues when the previous Bill was being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It so happens—hon. Gentlemen may have forgotten the fact—that the hon. Member made a most interesting contribution when these matters were being discussed on the previous Bill. This is one part of the Committee proceedings which he has not read recently. Otherwise it might have affected not only the speech he made but the clause which he has put down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), during the debates which we had at that time, put forward the very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
argument which we are hearing now, that these stop and search powers should be introduced for a trial period. What was the hon. Gentleman's view at that time on a matter which he now says is patently obvious and a matter of simple common sense? I refer to the debates on 25 January 1979. He said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are always subjective matters of opinion. I certainly disagreed with the hon. Member for Dundee, East when he said 'Let us legislate. Let us put it on the statute book. Then, if we find it is no t helping matters, or if matters are becoming worse in terms of convictions and offences, we can take it out again.' We never know in terms of convictions and offences. We may have a subjective view about police relationships with the public, but we shall never be able to say, because it is in, that that is the cause of the fall in the carrying of offensive weapons or the cause of the rise in convictions. One can never put in a simple 'equals' sign like that."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25 January 1979; c. 92.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. The hon. Member for Garscadden is about to distinguish what he said then from what he is saying now but he must appreciate that the hon. Member for Dundee, East was calling for a trial period for stop and search powers for offensive weapons and the hon. Gentleman's remark was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I certainly disagreed with the hon. Member for Dundee, East,"</p></blockquote>
and he went on to say why he disagreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the wriggling is on the hon. Gentleman's part. He is practising a little sophistry, although I must confess that I had not re-read this passage recently. I am relieved to discover that I am totally in the clear. What I demonstrably am saying to any fair-minded person who reads this passage is that I disagree with the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) in the assumption that one can get some certainty from statistics. I am saying that it will of course still be subjective when one comes to the review. It is not a case of saying that in five years we shall be able to say that crime has dropped by so much or that the carrying of offensive weapons has dropped by so much and that that is a fact about which there can be no quarrel and, therefore, we base our review on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that we should by all means have a review but accept that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>577</span>
would be a matter of subjective opinion. I believe that inevitably politics boils down to subjective opinions, and there is nothing wrong with that. It does not destroy the case for a review. It merely destroys the case for an assumption that we shall be able to do it on an agreed basis of fact. That is the optimistic assumption on which the hon. Member for Dundee, East was proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have convinced himself. I do not think he has convinced anyone else of the difference in his position now. He argues that the problem about statistics does not remove the value of a review, but certainly what he said at that time was that it removes any prospect of coming to any useful conclusions as a result of the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mind that the hon. Gentleman has changed his mind. We all have to explain at varying times slight changes of emphasis in what we may have said at a previous Committee stage from what we are seeking to say now. I do not object to that in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>578</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This sounds horribly familiar. Let me just turn the Under-Secretary's mind to the passage. The key sentence in that passage is,
