<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I refer to the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings for our last sitting, the eighteenth, on the afternoon of Thursday 12 June. I am sure that you, Mr. Gourlay, and the Committee will remember that at the end of the proceedings there was some confusion. I put it no higher than that.<br><br>
At column 1262 the Solicitor-General for Scotland replied to a short intervention made by his hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). I am anxious to establish that the <i>Official Report</i> is correct, that amendment No. 315 was accepted and amendment No. 316 rejected. There has been some confusion since the Committee met on Thursday, and no doubt we all remember the pressurised circumstances under which the decisions were made.</span></p>
<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order Mr. Gourlay. I accepted amendment No. 315 and rejected amendment No. 316. I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity of making that clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Although you may rule me out of order, I feel that this is an important point which should be raised. Yesterday I was in the company of some senior police officers who referred to the Solicitor-General's weekend speech about the Bill and his inference that the circumstances that led to the dropping of the charge—I can think of no better way of putting it—against Thomas Docherty in the Glasgow High Court could not be repeated because of the provisions in the Bill.<br><br>
Again, there is some confusion on whether where a senior police officer fails to caution an accused person properly at the time of that accused person being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1266</span>
charged, there is provision in the Bill to cover the position, and that the events concerning Thomas Docherty could not possibly arise again. That was not the impression of the senior police officers to whom I was speaking. This is an appropriate moment for the Solicitor-General to clear up any doubts that may exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter which arises in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to make his point of order, but it is not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, and do not seek to challenge it, but the Committee is placed in considerable difficulty when Ministers spend the weekend making speeches about the Bill now before the Committee and, having made misleading statements, defend themselves by saying that that is not a matter for the Committee. Some confusion has been caused. I should have thought that the Solicitor-General would have adopted a more conciliatory attitude this morning, and taken the opportunity to clear up the doubt that now exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the points that the hon. Gentleman has made. However, they are not matters for the Chair, nor are they in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am also extremely concerned about the statement at the weekend and the manner in which it was made. I ask for guidance—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already indicated that there is no genuine point of order. I cannot allow the discussion to proceed. Statements made by Ministers during the weekend may not be to the liking of hon. Members. However, those statements were not made in the Committee. It is therefore not in order to challenge them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Of course, I completely accept your ruling. We were simply seeking guidance from the Chair on whether, if it is not in order for us to ask for a statement,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1267</span>
it would be in order for the Minister through you to seek permission to make a statement on the subject to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to preclude the Solicitor-General's asking permission. Whether that permission would be granted is another matter. It is not for me to say to the hon. and learned Gentleman whether I would give permission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that last ruling, Mr. Gourlay. I am glad to know that such a course of action would be in order. We shall hope to see some result from that ruling.</span></p>

Clause 56</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
COMPENSATION ORDER AGAINST CONVICTED PERSON</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 312, in page 42, line 22, after "person", insert "who is over 16".<br><br>
This is partly a probing amendment. It will depend on Government replies whether it remains so or whether we shall seek to push it to a Division.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is fond of saying that he has not read and does not intend to quote from the Thomson Report, nor does he intend to read it if he can help it. However, I am sure that he and others will agree that the Dunpark Committee's report is extremely important. That report deals at some length with the problem tackled by the amendment.<br><br>
The clause deals with the fairly new concept of reparation for the victim other than that brought about by diligence. The accused can be directed to make reparation to the victim. It seems possible to combine the application of that principle with fines or even with custodial treatment; we shall be asking for a closer definition on clause stand part. It is not clear from the wording of the clause whether the principle is intended to apply to those under 16.<br><br>
There is a lot to be said for having a young person make reparation as a means of making him face the consequences of his actions. However, the Dunpark Committee saw the difficulty that the vast majority of under-16s are dealt with not in the criminal court but by children's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1268</span>
hearings. Paragraph 18.01 of the Committee's report points out that if its recommendations became law, which the Bill is bringing about,
<br><blockquote><p>“all criminal courts in Scotland will have power to make compensation orders against offenders convicted of a crime or offence, regardless of their age".</p></blockquote>
We seek to know whether the Government intend to follow through the phrase "regardless of their age," or to make a distinction. If the latter, how may that best be achieved? The report goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>“but it will be a court power and will not, therefore, be exercisable by children's hearings. As the vast majority of young offenders under the age of 16 are dealt with by children's hearings, our recommended power will not benefit the victims of such offenders".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that it wanted to bring such victims within the ambit of the scheme if that were possible.<br><br>
The problem is that the measure is designed only for courts and is not applicable to hearings. The position could arise in which there would be a distinction in the treatment of the offender in relation to reparation, depending on whether he appeared at a hearing or in a court.<br><br>
The Dunpark Committee had to face up to that difficulty. It regarded as unsatisfactory the fact that such liability for compensation would depend on the precise forum at which someone appeared rather than on any judgment made by a court—or by the children's panel, for that manner—about the desirability of the procedure. We should like to hear a comment on that.<br><br>
The other problem which arises is that someone who is under 16 is not usually financially able to pay such compensation. But someone who is earning money and has to pay compensation will suffer disadvantages. Therefore the point is made in a double way—the victim secures some compensation, which will not happen when an under-16 is involved, and the offender has to face up to the responsibility for his actions.<br><br>
Different criteria apply in respect of the under-16s. We regard the purpose of the children's hearing as being to remove the necessity for court action, to do away with a purely punitive attitude towards the child and to be part of the rehabilitation process. In this instance the element of rehabilitation that might be involved in the paying of compensation by an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1269</span>
offender clearly does not arise, as it is the parents who would have to do that.<br><br>
There is a problem. If it were possible to place a compulsory compensation order on an under-16 who is appearing in court—I recognise that he can be treated differently if that happens—the responsibility will not lie with him but with his parents. If the parents refuse to pay, two questions arise.<br><br>
Let us consider what would happen if parents were to say "We do not regard ourselves as having been able to have sufficient control over the child or as being responsible for him" and refused to pay the compensation. They would be faced, it seems with the same punitive action that would be taken against adult offenders. There is no provision in the Bill that would lead to imprisonment or other punishment for the parents because, as the report points out, there is no such offence. Indeed, it would be necessary to create a new offence. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>“ We have no mandate to recommend the creation of new statutory offences, such as 'culpable lack of parental control'."</p></blockquote>
Clearly it would be a serious step for us to make lack of parental control a criminal act. Under such a concept, none of us who is a parent would escape retribution. There are difficulties. I should like to hear what the Government have to say about the twin problems of hearings and courts. When a court is concerned, how are matters followed through and what is the parental responsibility? We should like clarification because we believe that children should be treated in the same way, regardless of the forum. One way of doing that would be to adopt the amendment. In other words, the measure should be applicable only to someone over the age of 16.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for moving the amendment, because this is a matter on which there should be clarity. I hasten to assure him—so that he may be relieved of anxiety—that, as a parent, there is no question of his being responsible for the sins of his children, unless he wishes to be. There is no power to order parents to make compensation whatever the age of the child, except, I am informed, under military law.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I turn now to the distinction between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1270</span>
children before a hearing and in court and to that between children over and under the age of 16 years. Dunpark recommended that a children's hearing should have a system of voluntary compensation, which would mean that there would be a suspension of judgment and a recommendation that the child should make good in one form or another the damage caused. The hearing would then reconvene to see how this was working. That was a recommendation of the social work services group consultative memorandum. The suggestion is being considered that such a hearing will be able to say "We shall ask you to come back in a month and we suggest that in the meantime it would not be a bad thing if you repaid the money which you stole from Mrs. Snodgrass, we shall reconsider the matter then." That system of recommended voluntary reparation is what is likely to occur in such hearings.<br><br>
However, children under and over the age of 16 can also go to court. In 1978, 1,443 children were convicted in court, of whom 508 were fined. There appears to be a significant number of cases in which a child has funds available to pay a fine. There is no reason why a compensation order rather than a fine—or even in addition to a fine—would not be appropriate in many cases. The 508 children were fined because it was appropriate in the circumstances and they had funds to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Solicitor-General any statistics to show how many of those 508 children paid their own fines and how many of the fines were paid by their parents? I appreciate that that might be a difficult matter for the hon. and learned Gentleman. More importantly, how many did not pay the fine and because of that were given some form of custodial sentence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That question is the logical inquiry from my statement, but I do not have that information. Under Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, a child can be detained by a local authority for one month in default of a fine. If I can obtain the information that was sought by the hon. Gentleman in the first part of his question I shall certainly give it him. However, I believe the answer is that it would apply to only a small proportion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1271</span>
of children.<br><br>
In strict logic, people under 16 years will not have any money but those over 16 might have. However, compensation orders will be applied relative to all the circumstances. A compensation order might well be the best thing for a child who is under 16 but who could pay such compensation. Therefore, it is not right to restrict it purely on the basis of age and anticipated non-earning capacity?<br><br>
I think that it would be wise, since it is adding to the armoury of sentence and trying to make sentence more appropriate, that it should be available to courts for all ages, and that was the recommendation of the Dunpark report. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Solicitor-General's wish to make the sentencing appropriate and let the punishment fit the crime. However, I think that my hon. Friend raised a very important point which has not been fully explored or answered.<br><br>
It was helpful of the Solicitor-General to inform us that under Scots law none of these children's crimes can be considered the parents' responsibility. We start from that premise. I am not clear whether that fits in with the Solicitor-General's comments last week about original sin. If it is original sin, someone must have been responsible for its origination and I cannot see that that could be anyone other than the parents—or the grandparents. Maybe there is some kind of supernatural interposition.<br><br>
However, if that is so, I sometimes think that we ought to consider involving the parents a great deal more in responsibility for the actions of their children. Accepting that the current position in Scots law is that parents are not responsible, we are considering children under the age of 16 who have committed criminal acts and are solely responsible for those acts.<br><br>
The age of 16 is not one pulled out of a hat. It is not chosen casually and it is not a coincidence. The definition of the school leaving age within the Education Act is not precisely the sixteenth birthday but round about the age of 16. Therefore, prior to that age children are still pupils and compulsorily in full-time education. If we believe our teacher friends, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1272</span>
children are <i>in statu pupillari</i> and the teachers are there <i>in loco parentis.</i> These legal phrases are much beloved by some of the Conservative members of the Committee. When the child is in school, the teachers are acting on behalf of the parents and the young person is in a particular legal state by all definitions and for all purposes. When he has no full-time earning capacity and no rights concerning unemployment benefit, social security benefits and the whole range of sources of income, I wonder if it is right to include him under the terms of the compensation order.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General said that, because about 500 people under the age of 16 in Scotland have been fined in a year, it is right that they should be subject to compensation orders either in addition or alternatively. It is open to argument whether it is an appropriate weapon in our armoury to fine those under the age of 16. I have doubts about that. Earlier in the debate we talked about the exclusion of under-16s from the provision of detention and the Government agreed that the parents should be informed when anyone under 16 is detained. I think that that recognises the special place of those under 16.<br><br>
The Minister also said that the Government were considering—and I hope that they will introduce amendments—giving the parents right of access to those under 16 if they are detained. I realise your anxiety, Mr. Gourlay, as to the relevance of this. It is relevant because it tends to prove that people under the age of 16 are dealt with in a special category under our law in a number of ways. I think it would be inappropriate for them to be included under compensation orders.<br><br>
I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in urging the Solicitor-General to give some further consideration to the appropriateness of including people under the age of 16 in the compensation orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General made great play, when saying that he did not wish to accept the amendment, of the fact that about 500 people under the age of 16 had been fined in the past year, which implied that they had the ability to pay. Now, of course, added to that there will be the possibility of both a compensation order and a fine, although that would not apply in all cases. I find it strange that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1273</span>
The Solicitor-General has come here this morning to deal with this problem, making the case that 518 people were fined under the age of 16, but not being able to tell us what happened in those 518 cases.<br><br>
It is relevant to the amendment that the Solicitor-General should be able to tell us how many youngsters failed to pay the fine. He should have received a brief on it, because if a large proportion of that 518 did not pay the fine and were then taken into care, custody or detention by the local authority, it would be fair to argue that the same would also happen if compensation orders were introduced.<br><br>
It might be that the number of compensation orders would be greater than 518, because it could be argued that all those children who appeared before the court might have a compensation order put against them—not just those who were fined, but also those sentenced in other ways.<br><br>
The clause which introduces the new crime of vandalism is also likely to result in an increase in the total number of children prosecuted under the age of 16, with again the problems of compensation orders to be paid on top of the maximum £200 fine.<br><br>
This is particularly relevant to younger children who do not have an earning capacity, because they are below the age limit at which children can be employed at all. There may be some argument that slightly older children have some earning capacity by doing a newspaper round or working on a milk lorry, but younger children do not have an earning capacity upon which the court can, as it can with people in employment, take a decision in terms of the level of compensation, because it is laid down how such amounts should be determined.<br><br>
How does one determine what a child under the age of 16 can pay, except by basing it on the parents' income? If it is based on the parents' income without having any power to enforce it on the parent, it is sheer nonsense. We cannot do it. It would mean that the court would say that the child stole £5 worth of sweets from a sweet shop—or, if he were a 15 year old, it might be £10 worth of cigarettes—so he must repay the shop that amount. But the child does not have money. He is unable to earn money. His parents say "We are sorry, but we are not going to pay."<br><br>
What happens then? Is that child to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1274</span>
taken into some form of custody for a relatively minor amount of money, thereby risking an increase in the numbers of children going into a detention centre of the kind we argued about on Tuesday? It would mean that, because of a relatively minor offence involving a small sum of money, the child would finish up in a detention centre with the short sharp shock treatment.<br><br>
It would be more sensible for the Solicitor-General to accept the amendment and make clear that this provision relates only to people over 16.<br><br>
It could be argued that we should go a stage further and cover those who have an independent earning capacity, which in some cases would be people over 16; but that is something we could think about before Report. At this stage, I feel that the right hon. Gentleman should accept the amendment because it makes it clear and sensible, and that should be the way forward.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always seems to happen, we have stumbled on a most important issue. The Dunpark Committee spent an extraordinarily long time considering the purposes and powers of children's panels, although that was not part of Dunpark's remit. Throughout one section of the report Dunpark states that it was not part of his remit to consider their effect, nevertheless he spent a fairly considerable time studying them.<br><br>
What worries me about this proposal to include 16-year-olds in what is basically an adult provision is the precedent being set that here we are, for the first time, bringing our youngsters into the ambit of what could loosely be described as adult criminal procedure. There are a number of inconsistencies in the Government's position on this matter.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the Solicitor-General say that about 500 youngsters under 16 were fined in the criminal courts in the past year. If that is the size of the problem, to legislate in this way to deal with not 500 cases but, I suspect, only a small number, is a strange approach.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Dewar) said that the ultimate sanction for the failure to keep up the payments on a reparation order is imprisonment. Dunpark recommended in paragraph 30, on page 109 of the report:
<br><blockquote><p>“Imprisonment should be the ultimate for failure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1275</span>
to pay compensation, but the court should never sentence a defaulting offender to prison unless it has first enquired into his means in his presence."</p></blockquote>
That would be through the old means court.
<br><blockquote><p>“Section 398 of the Act should therefore be applied to compensation orders, but sections 396(4) and (5) should NOT be so applied."</p></blockquote>
If imprisonment is to be the ultimate sanction for default in payment, there is the obvious question in relation to people under 16, who have orders placed on them, of what would happen to them if payments were not kept up. Who in law is responsible for payments in the first place, as these are minors, and who in law would be held responsible for non-payment? That is one point which must be answered before we make a decision.<br><br>
An interesting and related point concerns the position in Scotland. Almost annually, a fairly large number of outstanding fines are remitted. We cannot dissociate the question of fines from reparation orders because the two are linked. Dunpark links them in much of his report. It is true that he recommends, and the Bill provides, that if there is any doubt about which of the two the accused can meet—the fine or the reparation order—the reparation order has to take precedence over the fine. I concede that the legislation provides for that.<br><br>
The situation concerns young offenders and boys who serve time in borstal. The loose rule that has operated down the years is that if there is an outstanding part of the fine—in many cases, the whole fine—and it is considered that enforcing its payment would damage the possibility of the youngster going straight, or getting himself back on the straight and narrow, in my experience the Secretary of State has always agreed to remit the outstanding part of the fine, or the whole of it. The normal procedure is that the presiding magistrate at the trial is consulted, although in a number of cases the magistrate has failed to give his agreement, but nevertheless the Secretary of State has gone ahead with the fine remission provision.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General should address his mind to what will happen in that kind of situation. We are trying to help the youngster by remitting the fine once he has completed his 10 months in borstal, his two or three years in a young offenders institution, or whatever. The law, down through the years, has taken a human
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1276</span>
approach and has tried to help the youngster. But now, for those under 16, reparation orders will be attached. There can be absolutely no doubt that it will do some damage, although I do not exaggerate the case by saying that it will do a great deal of damage to the youngster's chances of rehabilitation.<br><br>
There was considerable comment from Dunpark that reparation by offenders under 16 should be on a voluntary basis—in other words, their parents should volunteer to pay the damage. But that is not what the Bill suggests. It suggests that reparation should be on a statutory basis. I am a bit worried that the Government are making a mistake in including youngsters under 16. If the size of the problem is 500 at the outside—and it will not be nearly that; I imagine that it will be something like 50 or 60 cases—I do not believe that it deserves this kind of approach.<br><br>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will consider what has been said by my hon. Friends the Members for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), and by myself. I hope that he will re-examine the matter. Even an assurance that he will further consider the matter on Report will satisfy us at this stage. If there is no indication that the Government are to be flexible in their approach to the matter, I should have to advise my hon. Friends to carry it to its logical conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the various anxieties mentioned by Opposition Members and I think that it is right that we should investigate the matter.<br><br>
Let us consider a simple example. People sometimes say that the trouble with children nowadays is that they have too much money to spend. However, that does not apply to my children. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that children sometimes have funds available. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) asked whether the matter should be voluntary. It will be voluntary before a children's panel. Therefore, we are talking about the more serious offences.<br><br>
Let us suppose that a child—this is the sort of case in which fines are at present imposed—steals a motor car and drives it away, or steal something out of it, or steals an old woman's money which is on her mantelpiece, or steals 30 shillings from a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1277</span>
pensioner. Is it sensible in the last example to say that that child can be fined but that the money must not be returned to the old woman from whom he has taken it? Surely it is more sensible to say "If you repay the money, that will be the end of the matter."<br><br>
If the case comes up before a children's hearing, the panel will say "We suggest that you pay the money. If and when you do, we shall decide what to do with you". But a court will ask "What pocket money do you get a week; how many sweets do you have a week; do you buy fish suppers and comics"? It will ascertain whether the circumstances are appropriate and then, if so, order the child to repay the 30 shillings that he took from the woman.<br><br>
That seems to be a sensible and rational approach, which the court will impose only in appropriate circumstances. Unlike a fine, there is no statutory alternative of detention. If the child says that he will not repay the money, an inquiry into means will be inevitable. When a child is concerned, the concept of righting the wrong that he has done to someone may be more appropriate than it is with an adult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the present law, it is not possible for the court to defer sentence to allow the child time to repay the 30 shillings mentioned by the Solicitor-General? Is that not a more effective and efficient way of dealing with such matters when children are concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, that is a competent condition.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) asked whether the parents would be responsible. There are two difficulties in this respect—first, when parents will not accept responsibility for their children and, secondly, when the parents obviate the punishment by repaying the money themselves. In that instance, the child does not suffer at all. But in some cases—although not in many—that would be the proper disposal, and should be available.<br><br>
I do not believe that children can earn money only when they have reached the age of 16. Many children do so when they are under that age. A lot of them make money by delivering newspapers and so on. Many have part-time sources of income, and a lot receive quite a good income from their parents. Therefore, that punishment should be available in appropriate cases.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1278</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the matter highly unsatisfactory. I understand some of the Solicitor-General's points, but he has not grappled with the main problems that are involved in this issue. We are considering two quite separate types of hearing—namely, that of a children's panel, and that of a court.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General said that the court was concerned with sentences where offences are more serious, but part of our discussion of the problem involving a 16 year old is to say that we must make a distinction between the seriousness of the offence and the nature of the offender.<br><br>
I thought that last week the Solicitor-General came a good deal of the way towards meeting me on that distinction, as he certainly did in our earlier discussion in relation to murder, when he said quite sharply that one had to distinguish between the seriousness of the offence of murder and the nature of the offender—the woman driven to desperation, for example.<br><br>
11.15a.m.<br><br>
The same applies here to an even greater extent. We are dealing with an offender who is young and often peccadilloes can erupt into something infinitely more serious, so there is a distinction. Even if the offence were of such a nature that people felt it had to be dealt with by the court, there is still the problem of how to handle the offender. That the case is even in accepting the distinction, because I am not so sure that the distinction is always valid, as sometimes the approach to the offender has meant that despite the offence he has gone to a hearing rather than to a court. It is quite unsatisfactory, therefore, to say that we must have a different sort of treatment available for handling that offender depending on whether he goes to a hearing or to a court. That is the first and fundamental point.<br><br>
There is, as has been said, an element of rehabilitation involved in the imposition of the reparation. But, again, a distinction is made. In the hearing it is perfectly possible for the discussion to take place before one can say to the child "Various options are open to us and one of the most important is that you have to rectify the damage you did to Mrs. Jones' car, her garden, the windows you smashed, and the upset you gave her when you pinched sweeties out of her shop." It is possible to do that to get into contact with the offender so that he recognises the reason for the reparation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0753">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1279</span>
being ordered and, in a sense, to try to win his good will. It may be a long view to try to achieve his good will but at least we should try to win his recognition so that something could be achieved on those lines.<br><br>
That is why the Dunpark report said that in the children's hearing there may be no question of a fine but there could be some sort of community service order so that there was a physical act which would make the reparation. Paragraph 18.07 on page 95 of the report states:
<br><blockquote><p>“Assent would necessitate the reporter obtaining the victim's consent to the proposed act of the child. If the victim gave his consent, the act would constitute an act of voluntary reparation by the child, who could not then go boasting to his friends that 'nothing had happened to him'."</p></blockquote>
A recognition of why he was doing that would, nevertheless, be a voluntary act of digging the garden, repairing the damage or whatever it was.<br><br>
That is not open in that way to the court because it becomes another fundamental difference in that the background preparation and the report prepared by social workers and others in a children's hearing are infinitely longer lasting, deeper and more serious than happens in the case of a court. It is not so possible for a court to make contact with an offender who is aware that he is in a punitive situation— <i>de nouveau</i>—he is aware that he is in a punitive situation, and I am afraid our youngsters are too wise to regard any soft-soaping coming from a bench that can prepare a compulsory punishment as having any validity. There is a world of distinction between the voluntary and the compulsory, the preparation of the social worker's background report, and so on.<br><br>
We next come to the problem of what happens if that fails. Are we really to magnify the imprisonment of young offenders in relation to their failure to pay fines? We must remember that that, would not be something accepted on a voluntary basis, as in the children's hearing; it would have been done in a full punitive court of law. We are told that it happens if he fails to pay a fine, but there is a massive distinction between a failure to pay a fine to the State and a failure to pay reparation to a victim. There are other consequences, one of which is that the victim has not received that reparation.<br><br>
Part of the purpose of using this is in order, short of diligence—of taking civil action—to get some reparation for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1280</span>
victim. That consideration also is involved. It does not seem to me that a case has been made for keeping those distinctions because of the differences in former courts and the problem of handling a young offender. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) was quite right to emphasise that the Dunpark report recognised that at the end of the day, if all else failed, imprisonment was the next step. On page 93, the authors of the report state:
<br><blockquote><p>“No one produced a good reason why the children's panel should retain its jurisdiction over a new offence committed by a 16 or 17 year old under supervision, and we have found none. Our provisional proposal received strong support. In these circumstances we RECOMMEND that all those who commit crimes or statutory offences after attaining the age of 16 should be prosecuted for these offences in a criminal court, even if they were committed while supervision requirements were in force."</p></blockquote>
So we are almost coming to the stage of saying, because we are bringing in this new implementation here, that we shall now cancel part of the supervision requirements, keeping the offenders under the supervision determined by the hearing, and bringing them into the criminal court in order that such punishments can be applied. That is putting the cart before the horse, and there are dangers. The dangers can be solved if the Government will accept our amendment to exclude the under-16s.<br><br>
The proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was absolutely right. Indeed, I would say that the weakness of the whole of part IV of the Bill, as well as the weakness of the clause, is the question of deferred sentences. If we are to apply compensation orders, particularly to a child, the proper way of doing it is by deferred sentence with an element of voluntary reparation. If that fails, the offender is brought back for sentencing.<br><br>
Those are the main problems that the Solicitor-General for Scotland has failed to take on board. There is a final problem. If the Solicitor-General is saying that we can use the courts to apply the reparation after an examination into the circumstances of the child and the relationship of the child with his parents, that will put a massive burden on the social work departments because the investigation cannot really be carried out by court officers. The relation of the child to the parents, the parents' means and the home circumstances should all be considered. But we would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0754">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1281</span>
putting an additional burden on the social work departments, when their capacity is already severely restricted because of the financial cuts, and without the advantages that come from that work because it is done in relation to children's hearing and that kind of supervision of the young people.<br><br>
I plead with the Solicitor-General to reconsider this provision. I shall not necessarily push the amendment to a Division if the Solicitor-General makes the right kind of noises. I hope he will say "Yes, we recognise that there is a problem here. Yes, this must be looked at." I think he should reject the proposition that we maintain the distinction of treatment between the hearing and the court.<br><br>
The making of such a distinction also begins to savage the general concept of reparation. A new punitive factor is introduced here. For all those reasons—</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 42, line 32, leave out "or".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 263.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a simple amendment which clarifies a matter which may not at present be clear. A compensation order cannot be made at the same time as deferring sentence. A person cannot be ordered to repay money and have his sentence deferred because that would be having two shots at the matter. A sentence can be deferred for a voluntary repayment but not a compulsory one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment and the extremely cursory way in which it was dealt with by the Solicitor-General is unsatisfactory.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman must advance his argument. I was waiting to hear his case. If the Solicitor-General</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1282</span>
<p>including the end point of failure, that is to say, imprisonment—I hope that the Solicitor-General will say that he will consider this matter before Report and bring in measures to deal with it. If not, I must ask my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the assurance asked for. In circumstances in which at present a child is perhaps fined £10, to make a compensation order to repay £10 to the victim is perfectly sensible. I do not think that whether the offender is under or over 16 makes the slightest difference to the appropriateness of such a disposal.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 8.</p>
<p>advances a case, I shall listen and possibly accept it.</p>
<p>A man who can spend his weekend making savage speeches surely has time to explain to the Committee the reason for these amendments.</p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 263, in page 42, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>“;or
(<i>c</i>) at the same time as, under section 219 or 432 of that Act, it defers sentence."—[<i>The Solicitor-General for Scotland]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 42, line 36, after "appropriation", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>“,or the unlawful taking and using,".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the crime of <i>furtum usus</i>—[<i>Interruption</i>]. I thought the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who managed to mug up <i>in loco parentis</i> and <i>in statu pupillari</i> before the Committee began, would understand the meaning of <i>furtum usus.</i> I now realise that his pretentions to a classical education were bogus. May I furtively tell the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0755">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1283</span>
Gentleman <i>that furtum</i> means "theft" and <i>usus</i> means "use"? Perhaps that will extend his Latin vocabulary from six words to eight.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) shakes his head in apparent disapproval. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Ayrshire took my remarks in the spirit in which they were intended, even if the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West did not. I shall give the rest of my explanation in English.<br><br>
Where there has been an offence involving the dishonest appropriation of property, or the unlawful taking and using of a vehicle, clause 56(2) provides that any damage to the property or the vehicle should be treated for the purposes of making a compensation order as if it had been a direct result of the offence, regardless of how the damage occurred.<br><br>
The statutory offence of unlawfully taking and using a motor vehicle is, however, only one example of <i>furtum usus.</i> The purpose of the amendment is to extend the subsection to the unlawful taking and using of any property. That is a category in which a compensation order would be appropriate.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in slight doubt about the relationship between the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"the unlawful taking and using"</p></blockquote>
and the last two lines of the subsection, which provide that damage has to be
<br><blockquote><p>“treated for the purposes of subsection (1) above as having been caused by the acts which constituted the offence."</p></blockquote>
Can the two matters be explained together? Is the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that the unlawful taking and using—the appropriation—of the property is the only offence covered under subsection (1), or that any damage following from that is related to the provision and to be treated in such a way? In other words, are the two matters covered separately? Is the damage that is caused seen as implicit in the act of appropriation? I am slightly confused about the need for the last two lines of the subsection, in view of the expansion to "taking and using" in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All that the subsection provides is that if during an offence under the Road Traffic Act damage is caused while the vehicle is out of the owner's possession, that is part
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1284</span>
of the offence. The compensation will relate to loss of use and to damage. The amendment merely extends the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that—or at least I think that I do. However if my car is taken, perhaps by kids, is left somewhere and damaged, are the kids responsible even though it is known that someone put a sledgehammer through it later. That is what might be meant by
<br><blockquote><p>"the acts which constituted the offence."</p></blockquote>
If Jimmy steals a car and leaves it while he goes to the pictures and Willy puts a sledgehammer through the windscreen, although it is known that Willy did that, the words seem to suggest that the action was caused by the taking away and that Willy is not guilty but that Jimmy is. That is a problem that could arise under the present formulation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not mandatory. If someone steals a car and a child is seen to smash the windscreen, any compensation order would be made against the child. However, if someone takes my car out of a lockfast garage and leaves it on the edge of a motorway when it has served its purpose, and the vultures come along to take off the wheels and remove the engine—that is what happens to a car with a cool engine on the edge of a motorway—I am left with a car that has no wheels or engine. Therefore, because the original offence had made it possible for that to happen—the vultures being unknown—a compensation order could be made to restore my position.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 313, in page 43, leave outlines 3 to 7.<br><br>
I trust that later in the clause we shall be discussing the principle and practice of compensation orders. Although I have some sympathy with the principle, I have doubts about the operation in practice. This is a probing amendment, which means that although we believe that we know what we are talking about we tabled it to establish whether we really do. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has said, there are often some interesting and surprising revelations during debates on such amendments.<br><br>
If we accept the principle and practice of compensation, why does it not extend to offences committed by people driving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0756">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1285</span>
motor vehicles or by those who leave vehicles where they will cause accidents? It may be argued that such matters may be dealt with through the civil courts and by insurance companies, but that can be said of other offences to be covered by compensation. I do not understand the reason for the exclusion.<br><br>
Why is it less criminal to commit an act in breach of the law by using a motor car, or placing it in a particular place, and causing loss to someone else? Cars are almost as much weapons as loaded guns. I do not understand the reason for the exclusion. I hope that the Solicitor-General will give us an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Trappist discipline of not reading reports extends to Dunpark as well as to Thomson. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is under a slight misunderstanding. Subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) does not concern "injury, loss or damage" arising out of an offence committed in a motor vehicle, but
<br><blockquote><p>“injury, loss or damage due to an accident arising out of the presence of a motor vehicle."</p></blockquote>
Dunpark gave four valid reasons—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Solicitor-General give us the reference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the reference, but I shall get it. However, I can give the hon. Gentleman the reasons. They are contained in paragraphs 8.11 to 8.15. First, most of those who would fall under this category would be insured. To compensate someone who is insured for loss or damage is inappropriate. We would be compensating not that person, but the insurance company. That may be a good thing, but if a person is insured compensation is not a valid restoration. If he is to be compensated anyway, there is no point in the court ordering compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the position of a shopkeeper who has property stolen from him and who has an insurance policy against that theft? I may have something stolen from my house which is covered by insurance. Does that mean that the court cannot make a compensation order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction because under the Road
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1286</span>
Traffic Act insurance is a statutory obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the statutory obligation is only for third party, fire and theft insurance and not for comprehensive insurance, which would cover loss or damage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so in strict law, but the Motor Insurance Bureau would cover anyone not covered in that situation. It does so with scrupulous integrity.<br><br>
One of the principles is that the victim should not benefit. If someone makes a claim for £1.50 stolen from his house, his insurance premium will not be increased. But if he claims for sunglasses stolen from his motor car in an accident, his no-claims bonus will go. The victim would benefit by a compensation order because he would not have to claim against his insurance company.<br><br>
There are three other reasons. Road traffic accidents give rise to liabilities of all sorts and to contributory negligence and the like—[<i>Interruption</i>]. The noise of the thunder is coming from behind me; that shows that the Almighty is on this side of the Committee.<br><br>
People involved in road traffic accidents—who plead guilty to an offence do not, in a very large number of cases, attend court. If a compensation order were going to be appropriate, they would have to attend. A very large number of people who do not now attend court would have to do so. That would be extremely time-wasting and very expensive<br><br>
A compensation order in a road traffic accident might well be for a considerable sum of money. People would therefore be much more likely to plead not guilty and to be represented or to get the AA, or their insurance company, to represent them, in order to try to prevent conviction and the making of a compensation order. If a car had been smashed up, the compensation order might be for hundreds of pounds.<br><br>
For those reasons, which were considered by the Dunpark committee, a compensation order would be inappropriate in road traffic cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that we have had a satisfactory explanation. Although I have not taken any curious Trappist vows in relation to reports, I had not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0757">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1287</span>
read this section and I am glad that the Solicitor-General has drawn it to our attention. I do not accept a good deal of the reasoning in the Dunpark report which the Government seem to have followed.<br><br>
This exclusion has one curious side-effect. It is clearly designed to deal with cases of accident, whether the car was mobile or badly parked or whatever. But it seems to me also to exclude the deliberate action, when, let us say, a bloke drives his car onto the pavement in order to run down his wife's lover. It would be interesting if deliberate action—using the motor car as an offensive weapon—were also excluded. I am sure that the Solicitor-General could argue on that point at great length if he were still pleading in the courts, as some of us wish he were, instead of confronting us with the presence of the Almighty.<br><br>
There is that curious point of difference between the accidental and the deliberate use of the car. It may also be that the Criminal Injuries Board would be more appropriate in both cases.<br><br>
On page 36 of the report, the Dunpark committee quotes from the 1970 report of the advisory council:
<br><blockquote><p>“that 'innocent victims in motoring cases are often covered by insurance, and, where they are not, the Government's agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau covers cases in which the Road Traffic Acts require insurance but for some reason the judgement in favour of the victim is not satisfied'"</p></blockquote>
There is that general safety provision for the victims in road accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to suggest a question that my hon. Friend might put to the Solicitor-General. I am thinking of the case of someone who is driving a car under the influence of drink, which is an offence. It is his car and is not covered by section 2. He has only third-party insurance cover and he is carrying a passenger. As a result of being drunk, he has an accident. As I read the present law on third party insurance, although if he hits another car that car and any passengers in it or pedestrians will be covered, his passenger, if injured, will have no insurance cover. I may be wrong but I would be grateful for an answer.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Solicitor-General amplify and explain that point? On the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1288</span>
proposition that we start with a general exclusion of this group because of the insurance aspect, one matter is not considered. If we deal with a minor cost—not the kind that would result from a civil action, but in the fifties and hundreds of pounds—there is an exclusion in the case of the driver's insurance policy. Under the provision he would not be eligible for compensation for the first amount of damage to his car, caused by another car. He would not receive it from his insurance company either because in almost all cases the first so many pounds are excluded from payment by an excess provision. When a person has suffered major damage to his car, if the person who hit it is fined and also served a reparation order, that seems a satisfactory way of giving full compensation. We cannot guarantee that it would come out of the third party insurance policy.<br><br>
I cannot accept the other argument either. Dunpark says that we must exclude road traffic offences because they do not fall within our concept of "clear and simple". In other words, because they are complicated and difficult they have to be excluded. This does not seem to be a totally satisfactory way of proceeding with legislation. The report points out that the criminal courts would find it difficult to decide instantly that the victim of a road accident had not contributed to the accident or to estimate the degree of contribution. Finally, it points out that the criminal court is not the proper forum for apportioning blame for road accidents. For this reason it says:
<br><blockquote><p>“Accordingly, in road traffic prosecutions the court would not necessarily acquire in the course of a trial sufficient information to enable it to assess the degree of contributory negligence, if any, in order to arrive at a fair figure for compensation. On a plea of guilty it would never have this information."</p></blockquote>
I accept that salient point. The guilty often plead guilty by letter and are not present during the discussion of the compensation order.<br><br>
This does not seem a very satisfactory reason for passing legislation of this kind because it removes from the court the discretion to decide in those cases which are simple and clear. For example, if I were to leave my car—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been following the hon. Member's argument. We are not discussing the Dunpark

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1289</span>
report, and I cannot see its relevance to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that ruling incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be incomprehensible to the hon. Member, but he is arguing whether Dunpark is correct. We are discussing whether particular lines on page 43 of the Bill should be deleted. Whether or not the hon. Member accepts the Dunpark report is not relevant to our discussion this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, but I have been 16 years in the House and I have never heard it ruled that, during the discussion of a precise subsection and a related amendment dealing with an exclusion based upon the arguments of a report, the arguments adduced in that report must not be referred to. I am relating the arguments to those used by the Government for the exclusion. For the sake of clarity one refers to the Dunpark report, as every Minister and member of the Committee has referred to the Thomson Report throughout proceedings.<br><br>
If you wish me, Mr. Gourlay, to delete the references to the Dunpark report, I shall invent a sentence which says—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not debarring any member of the Committee from referring to the report. But it is not in order to discuss whether Dunpark was correct, as the hon. Member was doing. He was giving his opinions about the sections of the Dunpark report relating to the amendment before the Committee. I was trying to condense his remarks to be more in order with that amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may say in passing that I still find that a most astonishing ruling and I may feel a need to follow this up.<br><br>
If these arguments, referred to in another book, are the arguments of the Government, I reject them. I do not accept that it is always difficult to determine. I was going onto give a relevant example of why it is not.<br><br>
Take the case of a car parked in the wrong place. If I were to park my car on the pavement outside my house, which is on a corner, it could cause an accident. In that case, my parking of the car clearly would be the cause of the accident, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1290</span>
it does not determine the negligence of another driver, who perhaps should have taken avoiding action. That does not lessen my guilt however.<br><br>
The point that I am making—irrespective of whether it is in the Dunpark report—is that if the Government are basing their case on these arguments, then it is in order for me to discuss it. The problem is that it removes the discretion from the court in such a case to bring this in aid at all. If the Government are saying—and the Solicitor-General will confirm it—that it does not fall within the concept of what is fair and simple, then I do not accept it. I agree that there are many difficult cases, but it must be within the discretion of the court to say "In this case we are satisfied that this was the cause of the incident, and in this case we wish to apply a reparation order as the sensible solution, rather than extending the size of the fine."<br><br>
The provision therefore removes the discretion of the court to apply a reparation order, which is in the interests of the victim, especially as he may have been hit by the exclusion clause on his own policy, which means he has to pay. Perhaps the Solicitor-General may wish to refer on Report to some of the points we have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are at the beginning of part IV, and the more I hear of our debates on it the more I am convinced that this part would have been better left out and introduced as separate legislation in the next session of Parliament. It is fairly obvious that although Dunpark reported in 1977—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is my hon. Friend to be entitled to refer to Dunpark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stated in my previous ruling that every member of the Committee was entitled to refer to Dunpark, but that it was out of order to argue the merits of Dunpark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though Dunpark reported in 1977, the intervening period, when we were all campaigning for victory in the election, meant that adequate thought was not given to the Dunpark report, and this is reflected in part IV.<br><br>
In the amendment ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) we find ourselves
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0759">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1291</span>
in the minefield of motor vehicle insurance with which subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) is concerned. Although there are the three preambles in Dunpark which the Solicitor-General used as his defence for having this provision in the Bill, the fourth and final reason which Dunpark gave for including subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) was the enormous work load that the courts have to carry on traffic offences. It has nothing to do with reparations to the offender or anything else. It is just that without it an intolerable burden would be placed on the courts, because of the enormous number of traffic offences involved. The truth, Mr. Gourlay—and I shall not say "As you will know" in case I give the impression that you, Mr. Gourlay, are more prone to traffic offences than the rest of us, which I do not suppose to be true—is that after a traffic offence in which two vehicles are involved, the police seldom charge only one person. Almost always they charge both drivers. Despite Dunpark, the police and the procurator fiscal almost always leave the court to decide who was guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend disagreeing with the Dunpark recommendations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to develop my argument. I do not wish to stray beyond the minefield of car insurance because vehicle insurance is a volatile subject anyway without my straying into other avenues.<br><br>
In traffic offences, it is always left to the court to decide. I accept that it is difficult for a court to decide the degree of guilt or innocence of the parties involved. The purpose is to ensure that the court system, which is already overloaded because of the enormous number of traffic offences, is not further burdened by the courts having to consider reparation for damage.<br><br>
A few points have to be answered. In the major cases in which a fatality has resulted from a road accident, I would prefer that the matter be proceeded with as at present, when a claim for damages is pursued through civil diligence, because we are talking of fairly substantial amounts of money.<br><br>
We all know what happens with motor insurance. There are exclusion clauses in all policies. Indeed, this sometimes keeps me awake at night. When a person is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1292</span>
convicted of drunken driving where an accident has occurred, the insurance company accepts no liability. That exclusion is clearly written into the policy. The Government however appear to be saying that the victim can pursue his case only through civil diligence and cannot, under any circumstances, expect that damages will be met by the insurance company. The money would have to be met from the driver's resources.<br><br>
If the Government accept the amendment they will do many people many favours. I know that this would add to the work of the courts but we would make insurance companies think again. Many people who are not at present protected because of all the exclusion clauses that insurance companies are prone to insert into their policies would be protected by the insurance companies being forced to think again about the conditions in their policies.<br><br>
This part of the Bill has not been properly considered. We can sense it in the uncertainty of the Solicitor-General's responses. There was no conviction in what he told us. Much doubt obviously remains in his mind. Even at this early stage, it might not be a bad idea for him to withdraw part IV and give it further thought.<br><br>
I remember the Solicitor-General saying to me, "Harry, you are far too clever to listen to everything that the civil servants tell you." I now say to him, "Nicky, you are far too clever to listen to everything that the civil servants tell you." I hope that through you, Mr. Gourlay, he will take my advice for a change, withdraw part IV and come back with a small Bill next Session. I believe that Scottish Office Ministers will be redundant from November this year because there will not be much Scottish legislation, so this would give them something to keep them out of trouble and stop them cutting expenditure on schools and hospitals.<br><br>
The Minister should think carefully about the position into which we are getting ourselves. The provision is extremely important, yet it has not been properly thought out. We should give ourselves time to re-examine the matter.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I gave the impression of having any <i>dubitas</i> in my mind. I have not the least doubt about it. It is definitely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0760">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1293</span>
sensible for compensation to be available as a penalty. The provision has been well thought out. I do not listen to everything that officials say—nor, indeed, have the Government listened to everything said by Lord Dunpark. If we had implemented Dunpark in full we should have introduced an extremely complicated scheme. It is important that the scheme be simple, and we decided to restrict it in that way. The English experience under the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 is interesting. Criminal compensation orders under section 35 of that Act also exclude damage, loss, death and injury arising out of road traffic accidents.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised the question of insurance cover for a passenger injured in a motor car driven by someone who was over the permitted blood alcohol limit. If the driver had third party cover the passenger would probably be covered. If not the question of liability would be extremely difficult. It would have to be decided in a civil court. However, the contributory negligence of the passenger in entering a motor vehicle in the knowledge that the driver had been drinking would inevitably result in a reduction of any damages awarded by a civil court.<br><br>
This is not a simple matter. May I increase the Latin vocabulary of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire by a further third, from eight to 12 words. He will know the precept in law <i>volenti non fit injuria.</i> Someone who gets into a motor vehicle knowing that its driver has been drinking is to some extent liable for any damage that he suffers.<br><br>
It would not be appropriate to make compensation orders in relation to road traffic accidents. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) seems to imagine that insurance companies would try to cover categories of person presently uncovered if compensation orders were made available. That seems to me most unlikely. Insurance companies would be more likely to look at their policies to see whether there was any other category of person that they could exclude. They would probably say that in the event of payment of a compensation order liability would not rest with them, whereas at present liability is absolute regardless of whether there is compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1294</span>
taken avidly to reading and quoting from the colour supplement of <i>The Scotsman</i> know that it is the Solicitor-General's greatest wish to take holy orders. All this Latin quotation is getting slightly out of hand. Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman is practising for the realisation of that ambition.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that on previous occasions we have heard forceful, well-argued, erudite, eloquent arguments full of commitment from the Solicitor-General, but that on this occasion he has been more halting and faltering than we have ever heard him. That must represent a lack of commitment to the provision. He had only two arguments. The first was concerned with insurance and the second with the workload of the courts. He got hopelessly muddled about insurance, which again, is unusual for the Solicitor-General because his mind is usually a model of clarity. Even the Under-Secretary was squirming when the Solicitor-General made a mistake about the no-claim bonus. The Solicitor-General spoke the total opposite of the facts. If someone loses his no-claim bonus as a result of that sort of accident he will be suffering a detriment for which it will be impossible for anyone to recompense him. So far from gaining, he will be the loser. I believe that the Under-Secretary is confirming that what I say is correct.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General said that damage to motor cars is covered by insurance. The opposite is the case. The only legal requirement is for third party insurance which, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) knows, does not necessarily cover damage or loss, whereas most householders would have insurance—if they are wise and sensible, which I believe would include most householders in Scotland—which would cover theft and damage. Therefore, the case is the opposite of what the Solicitor-General said. In most cases householders will have insurance which covers them against theft, damage by intruders, burglars or anybody else, but quite a lot of drivers will not have comprehensive insurance—especially because of the way that the cost of it is going up under the Government because of interest rates, the high cost of repairing motor cars and all the other effects.<br><br>
All of the arguments on insurance put forward by the Solicitor-General have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1295</span>
undermined. Indeed, all the other injuries that might arise from these sorts of accidents are not covered by insurance. I believe that the Solicitor-General and the Government are dividing crimes into two categories. There are those committed by car drivers, which will be exempt from that sort of compensation, whereas it is the people who own and drive cars who may be best able to pay compensation for accidents that arise. They are being excluded from compensation orders, whereas petty thieves and other offenders such as young children under the age of 16, about whom we heard earlier, will be included in the compensation orders. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) argued that point very forcibly.<br><br>
I hope that I have undermined and exploded the Solicitor-General's first argument, but his second argument is equally easy to undermine. He said that the courts will be clogged up by all road traffic cases involving compensation, and he implied that every person involved in a road traffic offence would have to appear in person before a court. That is manifestly not so. If the judge believes it is appropriate to enforce a compensation order, he can adjourn the case, defer sentence and call the accused person for a personal appearance to deal with the compensation order. The Solicitor-General shakes his head, but that is done in other cases. I have myself deferred sentence</span></p>

<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 7.</p>
<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 317, in page 43, line 7, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>“(4) Compensation under subsection (1) of this section can include the provision of service by the convicted person either directly or indirectly of benefit to the person offended against.".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that it will be immediately recognisable to the Solicitor-General that the amendment deals with the possibility of community service orders being applied as an attachment to compensation</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1296</span>
<p>for a personal appearance by an accused where he had written a letter but the offence was so grave that it could not be dealt with in his absence, so there is no reason why a case cannot be deferred when a compensation order is considered appropriate.</p>
<p>I found the Solicitor-General's argument's unusually obtuse. I was trying to achieve the noun for obfuscate.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How about "obfusc"? But the hon. Gentleman is seeking my adjective, not a noun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful not only for the lessons in Latin but for the lessons in English.<br><br>
In the light of what I have said and having undermined the Solicitor-General's arguments about insurance and the burden on the courts, I hope that he will accept what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), withdraw the subsection, accept the amendment or, at the very least, give us some assurance that he will reconsider the matter. My hon. Friends have raised enough doubts for the matter to be considered in more detail.</span></p>
<p>orders. In other words, where a person has committed an offence—I accept that he or she would have to be liable to imprisonment under the conditions of the CSOs—it would be possible as part of the compensation to attach a community service order so that that person would carry out, in the words of the amendment, a
<br><blockquote><p>“service … either directly or indirectly of benefit to the person offended against."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>I accept that the Dunpark report, on which part IV of the Bill is based, was published in 1977, before the introduction</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0762">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1297</span>
<p>of community service orders in Scotland and even before the experiment dealing with community services. Chapter 19 of that report draws heavily on the position in England and Wales, but I shall content myself with referring only to paragraph 19.2 which states:
<br><blockquote><p>“We know that consideration has been given to the introduction of four pilot schemes in Scotland for community service on the English lines, and we express the hope that in due course all criminal courts and children's hearings"—</p></blockquote></p>
<p>we can leave those for the moment—
<br><blockquote><p>“will have power to make community service orders with supervised projects. We cannot anticipate this by recommending at this stage that our courts should have power to make community service orders, whether or not the offence warrants imprisonment, or that children's hearings should have power to make such orders; but we can, and do, express the opinion that community service projects would be of real value in the corrective treatment of selected offenders, particularly young offenders, who were willing to participate in this way. We suspect that much juvenile delinquency today is attributable to children feeling restless and useless".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The report goes on to develop why juvenile delinquency is such a problem.</p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p>The Dunpark report is saying that if and when community service orders are introduced in Scotland, in its opinion the scheme should be used as part of the compensation procedures in the reparation by the offender to the victim.</p>
<p>The Government have not seen fit to act on that advice. I accept that it is advice given in the Dunpark report, and not a recommendation. As I do not wish to delay the Committee on this matter I shall simply say that it is a great pity that the Government have not seen fit to introduce the possibility—I put it no higher than that—of community service orders being used as part of the compensation procedure.</p>
<p>I hope that the Solicitor-General will come some way to meet us on that point and, if necessary, will agree to introduce amendments on Report which will take account of it. Perhaps our amendment is not properly worded and the Solicitor-General might consider that the draftsmen can come up with a better form of words. I should be prepared to accept that.</p>
<p>There is a strong case for the Government not to miss such an opportunity. If they have their head down and are determined to go ahead with part IV of the Bill—which is something I should regret
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1298</span>
because I maintain that it has not been properly thought out—they should take the opportunity which it presents. There will not be another criminal justice Bill for a long time and the Government should seize the opportunity to use the CSOs as part of the compensation procedure.</p>
<p>Therefore, I look forward to a conciliatory and good reply from the Solicitor-General in that he will agree to bring forward an amendment on Report which meets these points.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my answer will reassure the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). Moreover, for the avoidance of doubt in the mind of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), I would say that I have no doubts about my answer.<br><br>
There are three matters to consider. Community service orders, introduced in the 1978 Act, have been available for use in certain areas and I hope will be extended to Scotland. The compensation order introduced by part IV is another alternative sentence. There is no reason why the two matters should be, so to speak, amalgamated or linked, and no reason why they should not be linked in a sentence. But we must understand two points. First, a community service order is not intended to benefit a particular individual. For instance, someone may be charged with breaking a window in a pensioner's house or with pulling up roses in her garden. Of course, the victim is not consulted in the matter. If I were that woman who had been terrified by such an experience, I am not sure that I should want the delinquent to be sent along to my house to plant roses and come face to face with him—I might not have seen him before.<br><br>
We should remember that victim-offender contact would be an inevitable characteristic—or a likely one—of any order to serve not the community but to restore by an act or payment something that Mrs. So-and-So had suffered. In a case when that is not a consideration, there is nothing to stop a court from deferring sentence to get the person to mend the garage window or to wash off the sign which he sprayed on a wall. It is available in appropriate cases, but we should not confuse community service orders with personal reparation orders in kind rather than in payment. That is why payment is made to the clerk of the court and not to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0763">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1299</span>
the victim.<br><br>
Many people would find it horrifying to come face to face with those who had broken into their houses or shops, or who had snatched their handbags. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member is reassured when I say that, if it is appropriate, there can be deferment of sentence pending reparation in kind. Community service orders and compensation orders could either be imposed alternatively or conjunctively; we should not make personal service orders part of the law of compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I wish to speak a little more pianissimo, at the request of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). As my hon. Friend said, we are now bringing in Italian as well as Latin.<br><br>
I do not know whether the matter has been raised elsewhere, but the Solicitor-General said today that he hoped for the extension of community service orders to other areas of Scotland fairly soon. That statement is welcome and encouraging.<br><br>
I believe that all Opposition Members appreciate the Solicitor-General's point— namely, when he mentioned the kind of instance whereby the service is done on behalf of or for the person offended against. But, in that respect, there are two matters that are safeguarded in the amendment. First, the court would presumably make such orders only if it considered them appropriate; it would not do so in the type of case mentioned by the Solicitor-General. Secondly, the amendment uses the phrase "either directly or indirectly". The court may consider it appropriate to order the offender to carry out general work in the area in a manner which would help the victim, so that the two need not come into contact.<br><br>
However, the most important reason why I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is that Conservative Members are always preoccupied by money and property and believe, therefore, that the only kind of reparation that exists is through money. I understand how they reach that conclusion—especially as they are a materialist party in a materialist age. But surely it is not beyond the wit of man—or, indeed, of the Solicitor-General—to come forward with some sort of scheme that enables reparation to be made other than by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1300</span>
handing over of cash every week to the clerk of the court. Surely, it can be done in other ways, namely, by giving service and time; not time spent in custody, but time for doing something useful.<br><br>
I know that that purpose can be achieved through community service orders and, as I said earlier, I welcome the Solicitor-General's remarks in respect of their extension. However, I do not see why the concept of compensation or reparation—if we are to accept them; and I have some doubts about that—should not extend to offenders' being made to give something back through service, time and effort, as well as by handing pound notes across the clerk's bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been short, and I was not satisfied with the Solicitor-General's reply. It is not true to say that a compensation order is an alternative sentence—it is additional to a fine—whereas a community service order is an alternative sentence but can be imposed only with the agreement of the accused person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the Committee to be misled on that matter. A compensation order can be the only sentence, or it can be in addition to another sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But a compensation order is obviously an additional sentence, contingent upon a finding of guilt. A community service order is the alternative to imprisonment contingent upon a finding of guilt. No accused person can be sentenced to six months in prison and a community service order, whereas someone can easily be fined £200 and have a compensation order attached. The difference between a community service order and a compensation order is that a community service order cannot be attached to another sentence, whereas a compensation order can. But that is a fine legal point which I am content to leave.<br><br>
The Government are missing an opportunity. There are a number of cases—for instance, sheltered housing—where one person may be offended against. What is wrong with that person saying that, for all occupants of the sheltered housing development, the young offenders should be made to cut the surrounding grass and do community work from which that one person will not benefit, but of which he will share

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1301</span>
the benefit?<br><br>
Having said that, I shall not press the matter to a Division, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall not have a rehearsal of the arguments adduced in support of the amendments, as that will be regarded by the Chair as tedious repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause. I am unconvinced that part IV of the Bill has been properly thought out. But we are entitled to ask one or two pertinent questions. I shall be very brief.<br><br>
I do not think that there is much understanding outside legal circles in Scotland of how the clause will work. For instance, who makes the approach? When an accused is brought to court for wrecking someone's garden, normally the charge gives an estimate of the cost of the damage involved. If that person is found guilty, will the court decide whether to attach a compensation order, or does the person offended against have to make an application for compensation through his legal representative or someone else? The one thing that none of us can see happening is the defence solicitor asking the court to attach a compensation order. Obviously, there will be some mechanism for the court to decide exactly how much money should be paid. I am anxious to find out, for the benefit of the public, how the system will work.<br><br>
The best example that we have used this morning is the case of someone's garden being wrecked, but there could obviously be much more serious cases where the cost of damage was much higher. Am I right in assuming that the cost of such damage will always be included on the charge sheet and therefore the court will know that cost? If not, how is the court to be advised of the extent of the damage in money value? We should all welcome an explanation from the Solicitor-General of exactly how the provision is to be operated by the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise two or three brief points. First, will the Minister comment on subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), which provides that it shall not be competent for a court to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1302</span>
make a compensation order
<br><blockquote><p>"where … it makes a probation order."</p></blockquote>
I cannot see the reason for that exclusion. It seems that one of the ways of backing up a probation order would be with a compensation order. The compensation order would not be seen in the same punitive light if it were only added to a fine, but it seems perfectly appropriate. It means that although in other circumstances the victim would get compensation, where in the treatment of the offender and not just the offence the court felt that probation was the proper treatment, the victim would not be given compensation.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I stress that the probation order is seen in relation not just to the offence but to the offender. I would think that an offender who was thought suitable for a probation order would be just such a person for whom the compensation order would also be a suitable form of treatment. It is for precisely the wrong reasons that the order is not being applied here and that the victim suffers because he does not get the compensation.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>a</i>) is absolutely right. It is correct that the court should not be able to make an order where there is an absolute discharge. But I can see no argument for not using this provision with the probation order. On the contrary, that seems to me to be the prime example of where it should and could usefully be used to the advantage of both the victim and the offender.<br><br>
The second problem is the question of the guidance given to the court on whether a compensation order should be made. Either the court will have adequate facilities and people to carry out the proper examination into the circumstances and the milieu of the offender, or it will not. If the courts do not have those facilities—and at the present time they do not—there will be an additional burden on social workers.<br><br>
We ask again whether the Government are prepared to put their money where their mouth is. We who support them in this clause would welcome evidence that they intend to make suitable facilities available to assist the already overburdened social workers. This point has been put most strongly by those involved in social work and above all by the directors of social work and by the British Association of Social Workers.<br><br>
Thirdly, means must be taken to extend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1303</span>
as a corollary of this provision, the use of deferred sentences, because one of the inevitable consequences of this clause, if no other action is taken, is one that runs counter to the main aim of the courts. It is that, as a consequence of failure to pay the compensation orders, an increasing number of prison sentences will be served. Already, two years ago, 41 per cent. of people in custody were there because they had failed to pay fines. We all know that this is the main problem we face in connection with custody.<br><br>
It is inevitable that unless the social workers are there to give guidance in the first place and, secondly, unless there is an expansion in the use of deferred sentences, this clause—though it is an admirable clause and one whose principle we support—will have the unfortunate side effect of leading to an increase in the number of people in custody.<br><br>
I should be grateful for comments on those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, as you said earlier, Mr. Gourlay, we do not want to go over the points made in the discussion of amendments. But all my hon. Friends—and perhaps some Conservative members of the Committee who have been able to sit through the discussions—would agree that the debates on the amendments have shown that there is a deal of uncertainty, and have revealed many of the deficiencies of the whole system of reparation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has said on more than one occasion. There has been no consistently clear advocacy from the Conservative Front Bench of the need for this provision, no clear understanding of the way in which it will operate, and no clear conviction that it will be effective.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), I agree with the principle of reparation. If one took a poll in my constituency—or your constituency, Mr. Gourlay, or any constituency represented here—one would find a great measure of support for the idea of reparation or compensation, as it is described here. It is not only the hardliners, the hangers and floggers and those who normally take a strong line who consider that the person who is guilty should make some kind of reparation to the person who has been sinned against—to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1304</span>
use the Solicitor-General's phrase. When it comes to operating it in practice, it is much more difficult. The Solicitor-General admitted that to be so in the case of the recommendation of a minimum sentence for murder, in which Lord Emslie made a suggestion. Equally, many practical difficulties have ensured following Lord Dunpark's suggestion.<br><br>
Practising lawyers occasionally deign to listen to the arguments advanced for trooping through the Lobbies following the shouting of "Ayes" or "Noes" on the instruction of the Whips. Practising lawyers, particularly solicitors, have submitted evidence that draws attention to some of the deficiencies in what is being proposed.<br><br>
Every piece of evidence from lawyers—from the Glasgow Bar Association and the Law Society—accepts that the proposal is ideal in principle, and that they would like to have it, but that in practice they are worried about it.<br><br>
The Glasgow Bar Association observes:
<br><blockquote><p>“This Association does not believe that such orders would be realistic. A Judge would require in many cases to endeavour to assess the size of any such order without any guidance by way of evidence."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society states that there is no provision in the rules of evidence for bringing out information on which a judge could sensibly assess what the compensation order should be. There is no way—and no way has been suggested in the amendments or the Bill—that such evidence can be brought out.<br><br>
The Glasgow Bar Association goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>“This Association believes that the Civil Courts are the appropriate fora for assessment of damage"</p></blockquote>
and that the criminal courts should not be required to act in a 'quasi-civil capacity". One could not have a stronger representation from the Glasgow Bar Association than that.<br><br>
The Law Society says the same thing— namely:
<br><blockquote><p>“The Council accepts that an offender should make reparation to his victim, but feels that the wrong method has been selected to implement this end."</p></blockquote>
It adds that it would be better dealt with by civil action.<br><br>
I reinforce the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and ask the Solicitor-General to explain why there cannot be an extension of deferred sentences. It seems reasonable for the Government to say "We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0766">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1305</span>
want more instances where the offender will have to pay and make some reparation." Why can that not be dealt with by increasing the amount of deferred sentences and by saying to judges, sheriffs and judges in the district courts that the Government would like to see the option of a deferred sentence used much more often?<br><br>
Such a course would be approved by both the Bar Association in Glasgow and the Law Society. I do not see why it cannot be adopted by the Government instead of the cumbersome arrangement that has been proposed.<br><br>
I shall be content if the Bill becomes an Act and that in two or three years' time the Solicitor-General and his colleagues tell me that I was wrong, if I am wrong. However, I predict that the prison population will increase. The Under-Secretary of State shakes his head. As was said earlier, there will be those who are ordered to pay compensation orders when the circumstances are entirely inappropriate—namely, when they will be unable to pay and when, as a result, they will go to prison.<br><br>
It has already been said that the prison population in Scotland is well above that in England and all the other countries in Europe. It is far too large. If the clause is enacted, we shall have a larger prison population. I ask the Solicitor-General to refute this now or, if he can, to come to me in two or three years' time and prove otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He will be in holy orders by that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can but hope—or pray!<br><br>
My final points relate to the social work provision. I moved an amendment regarding fines supervision, which unfortunately did not find favour. Social workers are being asked to undertake the extra duty of fines supervision from cases that are carried on under the solemn procedure. This is an added burden on them. The Under-Secretary belittled it and diminished it by saying that it involved only 0.5 per cent. of total cases. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, these are the cases that are more likely to need fines supervision.<br><br>
We come now to supervision by social workers of the compensation orders. This is an extra burden on social workers at a time when their numbers are being cut. For all those reasons, although I have no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1306</span>
reservations about the principle—I support what the Government are trying to achieve—I think that in practice their proposals will not easily, sensibly or judiciously be achieved, nor will they be achieved in a socially just way.<br><br>
My colleagues and I would like to see greater effort being put into the thinking on deferred sentences. They have been considered as an afterthought in terms of the Government's suggestions and current practice in the courts. I should like deferred sentences to play a greater and more important role. I think that they would be a more effective way of dealing with reparation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief. I apologise for having to leave the Committee briefly for a reason to which we might refer later.</span></p>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Vandalism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not vandalism, although it may be linked to it.<br><br>
I support my hon. Friends on the social work element which they so rightly raised. There will have to be an asessment of what a person can pay. That can be done only by the social work departments, which are already under considerable strain. This places an extra burden on them. As my hon. Friend has said many times, the effectiveness of the job that they should be doing for the convicted person as regards trying to rehabilitate him will be lessened the more the burden of this type of order is put upon them. Increasingly they have to dig into the person's background and write a report, although there will already have been three other types of report written by the social worker under earlier parts of the Bill. Now there is to be another, and an investigation made into the person's financial circumstances. All this in not easy to do.<br><br>
It might be that the wealthier a person is, the more difficult it will become to make a means assessment because the wealthier a person is the more likely, it appears, he will try to hide his wealth. Will the courts have access to a person's income tax returns in relation to property owned or income received? There is nothing about that in the Bill.<br><br>
There is little in the Bill about how the assessment of compensation payable will be made. If someone with adequate means
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0767">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1307</span>
can pay full compensation, who will assess the value of the property and decide what full compensation should be? If, for instance, someone broke into a shop or a car and stole a tape recorder, how would a value be put upon it? Would it be the wholesale value at which the shopkeeper bought it, or the price at which he would have sold it—the market value at the time—even though he may have had it in stock for some time and be making a considerably higher mark-up on the price that he paid? Who will determine the compensation payable?<br><br>
If the stolen property is insured, will the victim benefit doubly? There is a later reference to civil action, but there is nothing about insurance. If someone will get recompense from an insurance company for the loss of his property, will he benefit doubly from compensation under the clause? The possibility of his taking an action is covered, but not the possibility of his getting compensation through a normal insurance policy, without recourse to the person who stole the property. As far as I can see—although I stand to be corrected by the Solicitor-General—nothing in the clause or in any later clause covers that.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friends, I have some sympathy with the idea behind the provision, the view that the accused should somehow compensate his victim for the crime. However, I have some reservations about the philosophy that the punishment should suit the crime. That can lead us down some very odd avenues. If I were to mention some of the more painful ones, you, Mr. Gourlay, would probably rule me out of order.<br><br>
Those reservations apart, I say, as the legal profession seems to be saying, that the provision is poorly thought out. That is not the way to achieve the object. There must be a better way. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) has mentioned deferred sentences—the idea that before sentence is passed the accused should be given the opportunity to make some recompense. That may be one way. I have grave reservations about the idea that a compensation order is actually a sentence, and that is clearly stated later in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the various points made by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1308</span>
hon. Members. However, I must first say that they are rather grudging in their acceptance. They say "This is the road to heaven, but we do not like the route that it takes."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are being led by the wrong messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of the highly intelligent means that hon. Gentlemen suggest would lead to the destination that they so much laud. The suggestion of the Glasgow Bar Association would give every solicitor two court cases instead of one. That, however, may be an incidental drawback—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that I am acting on behalf of my learned Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in only one capacity—making long speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of that drawback alone the suggestion would be inappropriate. Such a course of action is, in any event, perfectly possible at present. If someone steals a tape recorder from one's car one can in theory raise a summary action in the sheriff court to try to recover £30. However, one would find that a great deal more had been expended on the services of the hon. Member for Garscadden than was recovered from the court in respect of the tape recorder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of accuracy—I believe that that suggestion emanated not from the Glasgow Bar Association but from the Law Society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It came, in fact, from the Glasgow Bar Association. However, I daresay that the Law Society fell short in foreseeing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the other way round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am simply relying on the words of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). May I reply to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth, who asked who makes the approach. The approach can take various forms. For instance, the complainer will always be precognised by the procurator fiscal or by the precognition clerk. Naturally he will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0768">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1309</span>
asked what the damage is. If someone says that a fur coat has been stolen one of the questions always asked is: "Can you put a value on it?". That will be in the precognition. No doubt the precognition clerk will ask the person, if the court thinks that appropriate: "Would you like compensation?" and the procurator fiscal will no doubt suggest, whether or not it has been said by the complainer: "Your Lordship may feel that this is an appropriate case in which reparation should be made by way of compensation to the victim."<br><br>
Therefore, there will be various sources of approach and there is nothing to stop a person who wishes either to go personally to the court or to be represented as a party from making a representation that that would be appropriate. The court would then have to decide whether that was appropriate in the circumstances and—this was the second matter asked by the hon. Gentleman—after inquiry, as to the means of the victim. That is the same sort of inquiry as is made in the case in which a fine is imposed and where it is decided in what instalments that fine will be paid.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) raised an important point about clause 56(1)(<i>b</i>) which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>“where, under section 183 of that Act it makes a probation order."</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Gentleman will refer to paragraph 8.10 of the Dunpark report he will see the whole explanation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not allowed to look at the report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not for a moment saying that the hon. Gentleman is allowed to look at the report, but if he will consult his hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) he will find that the hon. Gentleman has allowed himself to look at the report and can tell the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West what it says.<br><br>
In effect, paragraph 8.10 says that in Scotland there has always been a tradition that one could make compensation a condition of a probation order and say "If you are willing to agree to repay the money I will consider probation." Therefore, that has been a condition of probation. If one makes a separate order, the person, while on probation, would be liable on failure to a period of imprisonment. That would be inappropriate so it is much better that any compensation considered appropriate by a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1310</span>
court which ruled that a person should be the subject of a probation order should be a part of the probation order and not of a separate order with a separate disposal from the probation order. That is argued with clarity, although at a certain length, in paragraph 8.10 of the Dunpark report and I believe that that is the proper decision.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that the social work departments would have to become means inquiry departments. That is not the case—the social work department does not at present go about assessing the liquidity of prospective "finees", if that is the right word, and it will not do so with prospective probation orders.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire said that this was a quasi-civil matter that should not be confused. All punishment, to some extent, is quasi civil because, in a way, it is compensation to a victim. For example, in a rape case the ferocity of the attack or the indignity to the victim is taken into account as a sort of public payment in years to society. Therefore, there is a quasi reparation element in the punishment of criminals. It is therefore rather artificial to say that it is an inappropriate matter for a court as it falls into what is only a convenient category of law because one involves citizen and citizen and the other citizen and State.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked for more instances. For instance, in the correspondence column of <i>The Scotsman</i> there has been a great deal of debate about a case in which a person was robbed of an antique table. That person saw the table in a shop and recovered it, but it was ordered by the court that he could not keep it unless he paid a sum of money for it. That judgment arose under the Edinburgh Corporation Order Confirmation Act which still subsists, at least for a year or so. There is the difficulty of someone's having bought something in good faith, not knowing it to have been stolen. He suffers a loss and the question is where the equity should lie.<br><br>
That would be a good example of an instance in which the person in question would get back his table without having to pay the antique dealer who had bought it in good faith. Alternatively, the person who got back his table would pay compensation to the dealer and the offender would then be ordered to pay compensation to the owner of the table for its loss, for the anxiety that he had undergone and for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0769">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1311</span>
what he had paid out.<br><br>
Let me advise hon. Members who are sceptical on the matter about the extent to which it has worked in England and Wales. In the first year 83,000 compensation orders were made and in 1978 the figure was nearly 105,000. It means that 71 per cent. of offenders sentenced in magistrates, courts for criminal damage were made the subject of compensation orders. There has been an extremely effective disposal of cases, in many of which the alternative would have been a term of imprisonment in the first resort.<br><br>
I believe that this is a very good new weapon in the armoury of punishment and that it will succeed in Scotland. The human race would never achieve anything if it started off by recording its doubts in advance of experience. The provision will not be difficult to operate; the courts will use their intelligence about quota and appropriate cases. Mistakes will be made because human beings are fallible. But I believe that fundamentally this is an enlightened and useful reform, which will do something that both sides of the Committee are anxious to do—namely, to ensure that punishment is made more positive and less negative, because the victim will be helped.<br><br>
Therefore I hope that after the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) sees the tag in his diary and asks me how great a failure the measure has been or—how many people have been imprisoned— he will be able to say "Solicitor-General,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1312</span>
forgive me; I was wrong".</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>“:Provided that where the person is serving or is to serve, a period of imprisonment or detention no account shall be taken, in assessing such means, of earnings contingent upon his obtaining employment after release."</p></blockquote>
This amendment is aimed at those cases when an offender is already serving or about to serve some form of custodial sentence. It makes clear that when a compensation order is made the court should not include in the assessment of the offender's means earnings that he might receive if he obtains employment on his release. That would be like saying to someone "We shall treat you as if you have a job when you come out—irrespective of whether you can actually find one."
