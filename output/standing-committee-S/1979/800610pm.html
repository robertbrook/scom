<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A problem arose this morning, Mr. Gourlay, with particular reference to the contribution and exchanges that took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the Solicitor-General for Scotland, as to who will prepare the reports that will be sought before sentence is passed.<br><br>
The understanding was that this would be done by someone concerned with mental health, psychological or social problems—in other words, a social worker, a community worker, or an old-fashioned probation officer type of official. But during the discussion of the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"from an officer of a local authority or otherwise",</p></blockquote>
to which an amendment was tabled by my hon. Friend, it became clear that this was so crucial as to require the withdrawal of the amendment in order to discuss the matter further in the debate on the clause, because the Solicitor-General gave the impression that it would be sufficient for the sheriff of the court to hear the views of, for example, the defence solicitor, in a plea of mitigation or whatever, in giving an account of his client's situation and that this in itself could be seen as sufficient in terms of this clause. That is not our view of the clause and perhaps the Solicitor-General would clarify the matter.</span></p>
<p>The Solicitor-General for Scotland <span class='member'>(Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I did not raise a hare that we need not chase. If I raised a hare that has been chased, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1118</span>
should like to call it back to its cage. Perhaps I can help the Committee.<br><br>
The clause clearly states that the court will not pass a sentence of imprisonment unless it considers that there is no other appropriate method of dealing with the accused. The court will not know that at any rate until it has heard a plea in mitigation, and for the purpose of determining whether any other method of dealing with the case is appropriate the court shall obtain
<br><blockquote><p>"from an officer of a local authority or otherwise such information."</p></blockquote>
If the sheriff of the court were immediately merely to say "I call for a report", that might be totally wasteful because, he might be able to say "I do not think that imprisonment is an option which I shall consider", having heard the solicitor in mitigation. I anticipate that the court will hear the person representing the accused and that if then the court does not consider that imprisonment would be appropriate, it will not call for a report, and that if it is considered that prison may be either an option or a necessity such reports will then be sought.<br><br>
Those reports will not necessarily come from a local authority—there may be another organisation—but that is the order of events, and I should not like to give any other impression. That is how it works at present, as I am sure the hon. Member knows, and that is how it would work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That has helped us considerably. We are now saying that the sheriff may decide that it is not appropriate in a particular case after all that he has heard, and then proceeds not to sentence the accused to imprisonment.<br><br>
Alternatively, he may say "I want to hear more about this case", in which case he would call for a report. I take it that the Solicitor-General for Scotland is saying that he would accept that in that event what the clause would suggest is not the solicitor's plea that he would want to consider further, but the report coming from a social work base source. That is my reading of the clause. The Solicitor-General for Scotland has now confirmed that it is his understanding and his intention. I am grateful for that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 49, in page 32, line 12, leave out 'may' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"shall, unless he considers that there are special circumstances making it inappropriate for him to do so."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 50, in page 32, line 18, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"; and where he considers that there are special circumstances for not making such a recommendation he shall, at the time he passes sentence, state those circumstances."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 296, in page 32, leave out lines 28 to 34.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tabled a substantial amendment. Amendment No. 244 seeks to remove the entire wording dealing with a recommendation by the court. I do this for two reasons. First, it is argued that the deterrent effect of a life imprisonment has diminished. People are no longer concerned about the length of a life imprisonment because in practice it generally means only a few years' imprisonment.<br><br>
We know that it is extremely difficult to average the length of life sentences. There have been attempts to add them all up and divide by the number of convictions and say that the average is X. This is an example where an apparent averaging makes nonsense of the facts. There is such a difference between the number of people involved and the nature of the offence, as we know, and therefore averaging the penalties does not make sense.<br><br>
It is therefore argued that because the deterrent effect of a life sentence has diminished, it should be re-strengthened by the judge making a minimum period recommendation. A curious fact is that in Scotland that was thought to be the position when the matter was examined in the Emslie report. In England the Davies report came to exactly the opposite point of view. It was said that if a minimum sentence was stated, that really did diminish the awesomeness of the life sentence. This time, in my opinion, Davies got it right and Emslie got it wrong.<br><br>
If the life sentence is to deal with the imprimatur that society puts on the awful crime of murder, the life sentence is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1120</span>
appropriate sentence to pass. That is society saying that this is our attitude to that crime. Then the circumstances must be looked at in a certain way.<br><br>
I reject the suggestion that the court should say that there should be a minimum sentence. I do not think it emphasises society's attitude to murder. In other words, that which is put in to make the life sentence seem worse than the minimum period in fact decreases its effect. I do not think it is satisfactory from the deterrence point of view and I do not think it is satisfactory from the point of view of trying to express society's view of this most awful of crimes.<br><br>
I come now to how we do deal with it. Frequently the last person to decide is, in fact, the judge. His task is to hear evidence, to hear the case and to pass sentence. It is then up to the other bodies involved, the parole board, and the executives in control of the imprisoned person. They should then make the decision in two ways—on how the person has been imprisoned, their assessment of rehabilitation and the cause of the circumstances of the crime, so that the deterrent that society wants to place upon it can be properly seen.<br><br>
It is the Executive and its social and punishment bodies, which should make that kind of decision, and not the judge. The judge—as is anyone else—is subject to the temporary nature of the hearing of the crime and making a decision. There are other factors later which have to be considered.<br><br>
There is no doubt that if the judge makes, say, a high minimum sentence of 15 years Or 20 years, the Executive and its bodies may decide later that the sentence should be less. We nearly had a debate on the freedom of the press last week in order to look at the kinds of comments that would come from the press and the public on the basis of what the judge had said. Any releasing that has to be done can be done with the minimum of publicity and the minimum of controversy. That is another reason why it should be removed from the judge.<br><br>
The judge is human and is caught up in the same feelings and attitudes engendered at the time of the trial, as is everybody else. He may do his best to elevate himself beyond it. One thinks of the recent unfortunate case in the Gorbals in Glasgow. If such an unfortunate person as Docherty had not been involved, what would have happened if a smallish minimum sentence
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1121</span>
had been passed? The judge cannot himself be immune from that.<br><br>
Therefore, we utterly reject this as a concept. I do not think that as it was in the Bill originally, when it was mandatory, it was right. It is also wrong for it to be changed from "shall" to "may".<br><br>
For those brief but strongly-felt reasons, I hope that the Government may reconsider going this far along on the argument adduced by Emslie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), I rise to speak to amendments Nos. 49 and 50. I draw the attention of some hon. Members present to the fact that there are a lot of other activities taking place in the House.<br><br>
The amendments were tabled to give the Committee the opportunity to debate the so-called Emslie proposals. To get the feeling of the Committee on this matter, Emslie dealt with retribution and deterrence and it is to the latter that I shall speak.<br><br>
I turn to paragraph 53 on page 25 of the Emslie report, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I turn to paragraph 53 on page 25 of the Emslie report, which says: 'It is reasonable to argue that if there is a general lack of confidence in the penalty for murder then general deterrent influence of that disposal is likely to be undermined. There is a real problem here with the present life sentence. It appears that many of those who consider the life sentence to have a low value as a deterrent have reached that conclusion from an incomplete knowledge of the realities of the position'."</p></blockquote>
I now turn to page 24 of the same report. I read from part of paragraph 51:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a necessary consequence of the two systems that it is possible that a person convicted of murder may spend a shorter time in prison, at least initially, than someone convicted of culpable homicide."</p></blockquote>
One of the difficulties we face is that to the layman there appear to be certain inconsistencies. I believe that Emslie saw the inconsistencies and imperfections in the present situation. He recognised also the lack of deterrence reflected in the far too high incidence of murder which persists today in Scotland.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
In Scotland today we have spawned a violent, savage, evil fraternity who place little value on human life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is talking about Conservative women.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1122</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is neither an academic nor a legal argument. Since the abolition of capital punishment we have seen the incidence of homicide increase dramatically year by year. Therefore I suggest that it is reasonable to ask whether the law which replaced capital punishment is working. I believe that the answer to that question is a definite and resounding "No". The majority of people in the country would agree. That surely gives Parliament a responsibility. We must recognise the growing and justified demand for a solution in Scotland.<br><br>
In my judgment, the <i>status quo</i> is not an option. It has been tried and has failed. In the absence of the will of Parliament to reintroduce capital punishment we must look for our answer elsewhere.<br><br>
Let us look at the Emslie report. I turn this time to page 41, paragraph 92, which reads as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our examination of the problem suggests that the primary consideration is to introduce greater judicial influence into the implementation of penalty and of enhancing its deterrent effect through the pronouncement of the court."</p></blockquote>
I now turn to paragraph 93 on the same page:
<br><blockquote><p>"The making of such a recommendation would enable a distinction to be made in public, by the Court, between one murderer and another. The convicted person and the public would thereby be made aware of the gravity with which the Court viewed the case and any potential offender would be made aware, in a more direct way than is possible with the present sentence, of the likely consequences of a similar crime. At the end of a murder trial which attracted considerable publicity the pronouncement of a sentence of life imprisonment coupled with a recommended minimum period would usefully sharpen the deterrent value of the sentence. The introduction of such a provision would also go some way to strengthen public confidence in the penalty for murder by removing the present anomaly whereby the judges, who are entrusted with the task of saying what custodial element is necessary for, in particular, the purpose of deterrence and prevention in any other Common Law crime, play virtually no part at all in determining the period which convicted murderers spend in prison. The present provision for obtaining the trial judge's view on these matters is of little value and contributes nothing to the general deterrent influence of the penalty itself."</p></blockquote>
I know that the Emslie proposals have been looked at in another place. I believe that the noble Lords were influenced by arguments which stated the weight of the difficulties.<br><br>
I said earlier that my case was based neither on the academic nor the judicial view. I take the view of the man in the street, who knows that a life sentence, on average, has nothing to do with life. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1123</span>
told that the average is nine years. The man in the street does not understand how Parliament, having removed capital punishment, does not react to the demand for a realistic deterrent.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Government have a responsibility to take account not only of the view of the people but of the judicial view. I suggest that the case made by the noble Lords was basically an argument against determinate sentencing of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Government to reconsider the possiblity of straight, determinate sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to go rather wide in his presentation in support of the amendment. This is not a clause stand part debate; we are dealing with the amendment. I understood that the hon. Member was speaking to amendment No. 49 and possibly referring to amendment No. 244. We must not allow the debate to spread into the question of capital punishment and its effect. The law of the land has already been determined on that matter. We are discussing whether a judge should have the power to have an minimum sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. I accept that point. Mistakenly, I was trying to stick mainly to amendment No. 50. If I have erred, I apologise.<br><br>
I expect the Government to weigh carefully the important safety factors. Violently inclined individuals must be made to think twice before they embark on a course of action which may end with the taking of another life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, so I am not arguing from the standpoint of experience of the operation of Scotland's courts. I am delighted to say that I am very ignorant of the operation of Scotland's courts.<br><br>
I believe that I am voicing the genuine concern of the law-abiding majority of Scots. I hope that I am also reflecting the view of the people who have suffered—the surviving relatives of the victims of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1124</span>
homicide. The police and prison officers have on many occasions expressed their anxiety at the alarming increase in homicide and the lack of a deterrent effect.<br><br>
We should explore all avenues to produce more effective deterrent sentences. If Parliament is not prepared to do that, we ought not to be surprised if the public show a complete lack of confidence. Members of the Committee must acknowledge that they have a duty from which they should not shirk: first, to accept that the status quo is not an option and, secondly, that the Bill is the correct Bill in which changes should be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is inclined to go rather wide in his submissions. His remarks apply to a clause stand part debate. We are not discussing the status quo; we are discussing whether the amendment should be made. I hope that the hon. Member will be more specific in his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. Again, I apologise if I have gone rather wide.<br><br>
I believe that amendments Nos. 49 and 50 reflect fully the public's view and concern. They would substantially change the clause and would bring it back to what it was originally intended to be. That is why I have pleasure in speaking to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just had a speech that was not only out of order, as you rightly said, Mr. Gourlay, but a speech that is also out of sympathy with the way that the Committee has been conducting its business.<br><br>
I should like in some way to compliment the Solicitor-General for Scotland. He has listened to our arguments and has answered them; he has taken them, or not taken them. He has been generally helpful. Even though I have not agreed with everything he said, I have been able to accept some of his points.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) has read a prepared statement in a sensationalising way. That is <i>Sunday Post</i> rhetoric—but that is unfair to the <i>Sunday Post,</i> as my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) says.<br><br>
I should like to put on record that Opposition Members who are opposed to capital punishment—although we are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0670">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
discussing that today—consider murder, which we are discussing, to be a heinous crime. We wish to ensure that it is minimised. We believe that life is sacred and, therefore, we wish to do everything we can to ensure that murders do not take place. Anyone who suggests or implies otherwise is totally wrong and misguided. We are equally concerned about the anxieties of the man in the street.<br><br>
My understanding is that we have to take account of deterrence. There is conflicting evidence from other countries about the deterrent effects of various kinds of sentence. But we have also to take account of rehabilitation and of the fact that, if we accept the <i>status quo</i> and do not have capital punishment, we should be trying above all not to have to incarcerate people in any kind of institution until they die. We should try, using all the methods at our disposal, to rehabilitate them and bring them back into normal living so that they may contribute positively to society. That must be our aim. If it is not our aim, we are wasting our time. We might as well not bother, and we certainly cannot call ourselves a civilised society.<br><br>
Among the murders that we are considering, there are a large number—the Solicitor-General will know the statistics better than I—that occur within the family circle: what might be called crimes of passion, which are not premeditated, thuggish crimes of the kind that the hon. Member for Perth and Perthshire mentioned. We must consider the circumstances of such crimes also.<br><br>
This clause—as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) will be relieved to recall and will certainly reiterate—was not in the previous Government's Bill. That Government would not have contemplated such a provision. The clause was also rejected by another place. Whatever criticisms there are about the structure of that place—the way in which people arrive there, by heredity and so on—the very criticisms that we have made of it, and of the reactionary way in which it normally deals with matters, only underline the importance of the fact that those people have rejected the clause. For, if such reactionary bodies reject a clause of this kind, it would surely be surprising if the democratically elected body accepted it.<br><br>
In the absence of the wisdom of the Thomson report, I turn to other advisers. I look at what the solicitors say. The Law
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
Society of Scotland says in its memorandum:
<br><blockquote><p>"The general view of the Council is that the present law, contained in Section 205 of the 1975 Act, which allows a judge to recommend a minimum sentence where life imprisonment is imposed, is satisfactory."</p></blockquote>
It actually says "if satisfactory", but that is presumably a typing error.<br><br>
If the Solicitor-General is not impressed by solicitors, being himself an advocate, he can turn to the Faculty of Advocates. It says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Faculty is not in favour of a provision for a mandatory recommendation of a minimum sentence. The Faculty supports the provision for a recommendation of a minimum sentence at the discretion of the judge"—</p></blockquote>
which is the present position. If we believe that the judges can exercise such discretion properly, why not leave them with that discretion as at present? The Solicitor-General is nodding. I understand, then, that he must be about to withdraw the clause—unless I misunderstand the position.<br><br>
In addition to the solicitors and advocates making that recommendation, the social workers make it even more strongly. The directors and the lay social workers—whether they include my revered colleague is a matter for legal interpretation—reject it. The Solicitor-General may have read their representations. They say that rehabilitation of those lifers will be much more difficult if we accept what is being suggested by the Government.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
The number of lifers is increasing and their rehabilitation into society will be much more difficult. The judge makes his decision at the time that the trial is completed and he passes down the sentence. But later, the responsibility rightly becomes that of the parole board, which was statutorily set up for that purpose, and of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
My understanding—I think that it is repeated in the representations—that the parole board consults the original sentencing judge. So that in the light of how the man or woman—most often the man, unfortunately—has reacted to the treatment in custody, the judge and the parole board can make their comments. That seems to be an eminently sensible solution.<br><br>
I hope that we shall reject the reactionary proposal of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0671">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
Walker), standing in for his hon. Friend who is on an abortive mission in Glasgow. I hope that Glasgow will put him in his place and return the Labour candidate in the by-election.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will also reject the clause—but that may be straying on to clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) who seems to find this almost as easy as my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) does—in the opposite direction—I find it an extremely difficult issue on which to reach any settled conclusion.<br><br>
I have two conflicting sentiments that I find difficult to reconcile. I think that the hon. Member for South Ayrshire is mistaken if he does not appreciate that among the general public in Scotland there is a strong feeling that life sentences do not represent "life". There is a strong body of opinion—not among lawyers or social workers, or anyone of that professional order—among the general public that, now that we do not have capital punishment, there ought to be a sentence with proper deterrent effect.<br><br>
There is, correctly or incorrectly, a view at large that a number of people get off with a short period in prison when they have committed the most awful crime in our calendar. Given that strength of feeling it is not surprising that this matter was considered in great detail and studied very carefully by the Emslie committee. It was a responsible and most distinguished committee and judge who came up with the conclusion that there ought to be a reversal of the recommendation. The Committee would be in dereliction of its duty it if did not appreciate just how strong are feelings in Scotland at the present time on this matter.<br><br>
Set against that, my view was, and remains, that we should have substantial penalties and sentences in Scotland for the crime of murder. Here we must consider a more technical matter than simply the determination of the correct length of sentence. I should like judges in Scotland to use the existing power of recommendation more frequently than they do.<br><br>
I also looked at the careful debate in the House of Lords. Both the noble Lords, Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Fraser of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
Tullybelton, outstanding judges whose reputation in Scotland extends beyond their legal knowledge to their penal policies—Lord Fraser has for many years been known as a considerable thinker on penal matters—came down firmly in favour of more or less retaining the status quo.<br><br>
I do not wish to slip into a clause stand part debate, but I would say that there are parts of the clause that, even as it stands, represent something of a change on the status quo in terms of recommendations on and appeal against recommendations. I slowly concluded that their noble Lordships were correct and that we should stick with what was said in the other place. Although it is not expressly set out, not only is there an undercurrent within the speeches of the two noble judicial Lords from Scotland, but, indeed, Lord Emslie may have departed from the view that he expressed in 1972.<br><br>
It is worth emphasising that there is at least one good reason why the recommendations of the Emslie report may be departed from. I refer to the problem that it adverted to in its consideration of what would happen if a judge subsequently died. It was made quite clear by the noble Lords Lord Keith and Lord Ross of Marnock that, for at least eight years, there has been a provision that a judge should set out his contemporaneous views on the circumstances of a case. However, I understand that that is an informal procedure. It was referred to in the Emslie report as something of a defect, but it appears to be covered, informally at least, by existing practice.<br><br>
I do not think that we can lightly disregard the problem of how a life sentence for murder fits in with culpable homicide. I do not see how that problem is resolved at present. The problem will remain if the clause goes forward unamended. Page 24 of the Emslie report stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a necessary consequence of the two systems that it is possible that a person convicted of murder may spend a shorter time in prison, at least initially, than someone convicted of culpable homicide."</p></blockquote>
I consider that to be a practical problem also. Lawyers are occasionally confronted with the decision on what advice they should give to a client, whether he should plead guilty to murder or should seek to persuade the advocate depute to accept a plea of guilty to the apparently lesser charge of culpable homicide. In the second case, the client may find himself potentially
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0672">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
in prison for a longer period than he would have done if he had pleaded guilty to the charge of murder.<br><br>
It is a considerable problem because that happens in practice—not daily in the courts, but occasionally. It means that the statistics on murder or culpable homicide may be distorted because a decision has been taken to plead guilty to murder rather than culpable homicide in order to reduce the sentence.<br><br>
I do not think that the provision fits in happily with the problem of determinate sentences in relation to culpable homicide. It is a problem that the Emslie committee wrestled with, but came up with no clear decision. The only criticism of substance that I would make of the debate in the other place was that this problem was scarcely adverted to. Lord Ross of Marnock made a reference to it but, apart from that, the problem of the relationship with the crime of murder, which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, if I have noted it correctly, is the most awful in our calendar. If one is to be punished by a lesser sentence than culpable homicide, there is still a problem to be dealt with, and it is not dealt with in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-Geueral for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to cut short discussion on this matter—there will be a clause stand part debate—but it might be helpful if at this point I made the Government's position clear on these amendments and perhaps in so doing and without straying out of order, anticipated one's view on clause stand part.<br><br>
The Government undertook in their manifesto to implement the recommendations of the Emslie committee. I emphasise that it was a committee judgment and not the judgment of the Lord Justice General. Whether or not Lord Emslie may have modified, altered, changed, reversed, or done anything to his views is not a matter that we take into account, because it was a committee, and that committee is dispersed.<br><br>
When we had a debate a year or so ago there were some analytical arguments of the completely reversed position which the Lord Justice Edmund Davies report had in England. One can say without any fear of contradiction from any Committee member that the anticipation of what will be the effect of going one way or the other is a matter of intelligent speculation, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1130</span>
no more. That is the matter with which I want to begin.<br><br>
First, I wish to deal with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) when speaking on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), whose apologies for absence he has given to the Committee. It is important to air this matter. With respect to my hon. Friend, I do not think that to talk about "on average" is sensible. The crime of homicide has been riddled with a variety of historical accidents, and culpable homicide results in death. It is because it results in the destruction of human life that we regard these crimes and their punishment with such awe.<br><br>
Culpable homicide can range from what may be the most incidental of assaults which result in death and have culpability of a very small kind, but where human life is destroyed, to the most appalling murder, which is brought down to culpable homicide only by minimal diminished responsibility. Therefore, let us understand that in homicide there is a vast range in culpabale homicide.<br><br>
By contrast, murder has always been treated in the law of having a monotonous wrong. Perhaps we may have to alter our view of the concept of murder, of having a monotonous wrong. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said, there may be culpable homicides which get worse punishment or are worse deeds than murder. Surely, what is more relevant is that there may be attempted murders which are far more atrocious deeds, although they do not involve the destruction of human life, than murder itself.<br><br>
For instance, suppose that a person were to throw a hand grenade, which failed to go off into a public house, and through no fault of that person nobody was injured, although he intended to create abominable carnage. Is that worse, or less fair, than the case of a person, who is under stress in his family sticking a knife in his brother or father, where there are no circumstances to make it possible to hop it over the hedge into culpable homicide? Those are philosophical aspects of homicide. We must approach the matter with care.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
I turn to the amendment of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0673">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1131</span>
Buchan). Another element which we must take into consideration at all times is public fear. Following the murders of old people in the east end of Glasgow, for example, the culprit was given a sentence with a minimum recommendation of 15 years. There is no question but that the murders created such public fear that any suggestion that such a person could be released without at least a definitive period of imprisonment being served would not have done justice to that fear.<br><br>
I hope that I do not arouse the irritation of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West by citing a recent case in which the protection of the right to silence resulted in the release of a person presumed to be innocent. The public reaction was not "Hurrah for the right to silence!" but "Heavens above, may it happen again?" No one in the Committee should overlook the fact that one of the principal duties of legislators is to ensure that public fear is allayed.<br><br>
I know of a man, now dead, who came from my constituency. I cannot, of course, mention his name. There was a genuine fear of his ever being released and returning to the village from which he came to commit again the sort of crime which he had committed.<br><br>
Therefore, I believe that it is a combination of judgment. In the amendments it is suggested that there should always be a recommendation. Looking at what was said in another place, I ask how one would reassure the public if two men were sitting in the dock together, having participated in the same offence—one, from whom a plea of guilty had been accepted, convicted of a technicality of culpable homicide and the other, from whom a plea of guilty had also been accepted, convicted of murder—and the judge had to say "I sentence you to 15 years' imprisonment, Mr. A" and "Mr. B, I sentence you, as I am bound to do, to life imprisonment, and I recommend that you serve not less than 10 years".<br><br>
The public would not understand that. Furthermore, if one were to do mental arithmetic and put in a proposal that the 10 years could be made artificially to look as though that were the sentence to be served for culpable homicide, and brought back again by remission and so on, that would be a deceitful exercise.<br><br>
As Lord Fraser of Tullybelton said in another place, it would be a gross misunderstanding of public opinion if for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
domestic murder, which in law must remain murder, because nothing can take it into the category of the lower form of homicide, one had the recommendation that a person should serve a minimum of two years.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said when we last debated this matter, let this message go out: let us never forget that the penalty for murder is imprisonment for life and that, if there is any release on licence, it is always subject to the fact that the person has been sentenced to imprisonment for life—no less.<br><br>
Let us also remember that it is difficult to say "I shall judge a person's conduct when he gets out of prison on his conduct while he has been in prison." I shall not name prisoners—I can think of two— who were the most model prisoners while in prison, but who committed the most heinous offences before and since their release. I can think of another who makes protestation of cure, but of whom I can make judgment in the knowledge that that is not so. There are many cases of that kind.<br><br>
It is, therefore, a difficult decision. The amendment to the present clause, which requires—not on an informal arrangement—that a judge shall state his reasons at the time and put in a report at the time, will assist the parole board when it comes to assess and make the immensely difficult later decision.<br><br>
I therefore seriously say to my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West that it is important that the court should have the right to reassure the public in circumstances where there is genuine public fear, and the matter should be flexible. I therefore urge consideration of whether it would not be better to seek to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate, I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) that it is not an easy subject. These are difficult areas for debate.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General has given us a considered contribution, although I did not agree—for reasons which I shall explain—with everything that he said. I accept the seriousness of his presentation and the genuineness with which he puts forward his point of view.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1133</span>
I would also say—I hope that he will not take this as a petty point—that I accept that it is not easy for the hon. and learned Gentleman to ask for the withdrawal of the amendment of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) because the Emslie report has been a talisman in this field for the Conservative Party in Scotland ever since Lord Emslie reported eight years ago. It was, of course a specific manifesto commitment. It was singled out and deliberately put in as a little goody which the Conservative Party would deliver. Therefore, the Solicitor-General's decision to recommend to the Committee that we should abandon the Emslie report's main recommendations, is one which he cannot have reached lightly. I pay tribute to what he has done. When we come to the tally at the end of the day, that is one matter which will be on the wrong side—at least in that rather silly arithmetic. It is not just in criminal statistics that the numbers game can be misleading.<br><br>
I appreciate the importance of the issue. We have three substantial amendments. The one that has received the most attention is that we should implement the Emslie recommendations. The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is basically that we should remove from the courts completely the power to recommend a minimum sentence, and that a sentence for life should be a sentence for life— full stop.<br><br>
The amendment in my name to take out subsection (4) is a much less dramatic amendment, but if my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West does not succeed in his amendment, the justification for subsection (4) should have some consideration.<br><br>
I had the advantage of talking to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), and I recognise that he has tabled his amendments in order to spark off discussion, because he felt that this was a matter of sufficient importance fully to be considered. With all respect to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, it is clear that he is paddling a fairly lonely canoe at present. I do not think that there will be much support if he tries to force his amendments to a Division. They raise very important issues. Lord Emslie made it clear in paragraph 92 the key paragraph in the Emslie report:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Our examination of the problem suggests that the primary consideration is to introduce greater judicial influence into the implementation of penalty and of enhancing its deterrent effect through the pronouncement of the court."</p></blockquote>
That was very much the theme on which the hon. Member elaborated.<br><br>
I am not desperately impressed by the greater judicial influence in the implementation of the penalty. I think that we have gone some way towards that in any event by the fact that at the conclusion of the trial, the judge compiles a report, which is there, even if he is not, when the matter of release on licence may be considered.<br><br>
I think that it is relevant to remark that a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since Emslie first reported—to use a phrase from the House of Lords debate, when that point was strongly made by both Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Fraser of Tullybelton. In fact, it was very early in our experience of the life sentence as we now know it, and I think that it is clear that from the judge's point of view there is no pressure to have that greater influence to which Lord Emslie referred. We have the report which is now available to the authorities when the time for consideration comes up.<br><br>
I cannot, of course, quote from another place, but I refer to the debate which took place on 27 February during the Committee stage, when the amendment finally came up, and the amendment that we are now discussing, in the sense that it was to decide whether the recommendation should be mandatory or non-mandatory. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton not only did not want this additional responsibility but made clear that he had consulted a large number of his colleagues in the Scottish judiciary—he was careful to say not all of them, for practical reasons—and had found not a single person who wanted the enhanced role to which Lord Emslie had originally referred.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not think that we need spend a great deal of time on the first of the primary considerations that in paragraph 92 motivated Lord Emslie. The second one that he referred to was, of course, enhancing the deterrent effect through the pronouncement of the court. I can say only that I recognise that deterrence is a consideration in sentencing policy. I think that sometimes it has too predominant a place, particularly in the minds of those who do not have to sentence but who talk about it. I include myself, I hasten to say; unlike my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1135</span>
South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) I have never passed sentence on anyone, and it is not a responsibility that I should particularly like.<br><br>
I draw the committee's attention to the pronouncements of the parallel English committee, chaired by Lord Justice Edmund Davies, a distinguished judge whose name has cropped up in the world of pay negotiations since then. In paragraph 31, the committee reported:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not feel that in the less heinous cases the making of a recommendation serves any useful purpose. If the intention in requiring recommendations to be made in almost all cases is thereby to increase the deterrent effect of the penalty for murder, it is difficult to see how this is achieved by a recommendation of a short period. Indeed, such a recommendation may diminish the deterrent effect and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice—if it appears on the face of it, to those who do not know all the facts of the case, and who perhaps rely on headlines in the press that, for example, four years is recommended as the period to be served by a murderer."</p></blockquote>
That is a very important point, because murder is headline material.<br><br>
I have constantly had to say to friends, as, I am sure, has every member of this Committee, never mind every lawyer, "Look, you cannot jump to that conclusion. You haven't seen the social inquiry report; you didn't hear the evidence. You don't know what lay behind the sentencing decision that was taken by the judge", not just in a murder case but in any serious case.<br><br>
Given that inevitable state of public ignorance, in routine murder cases if we are to have a recommended minimum sentence, as the then Lord Justice Edmund Davies said, it is likely to undermine and not enhance the deterrent effect of sentencing as we know it. He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"It seems to us that if the power to make recommendations is exercised sparingly and only in the most serious cases, in which it is in the nature of things unlikely that the accused would be released before serving the length of the minimum period recommended the deterrent effect is greater than if recommendations are made in almost all cases. At present recommendations receive great publicity and the impact would, we feel, be diminished if they became so usual that little or no publicity were given to them. In our view the value of recommendations at the present time depends upon the fact that they are made only exceptionally and not as a matter of routine."</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that later when discussing the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
I find the arguments of Lord Justice Edmund Davies a great deal more persuasive than those in the Emslie report. In another place it was suggested by Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, among others, that the effect would be that a routine—a tariff—would emerge. What would happen, in effect, in the case of a domestic murder with some mitigating circumstances is that there would be a five-year minimum; if it was an affray after the pubs closed in Glasgow, when someone pulled a knife and in the confusion a man was left bleeding to death, it would be 10 years, and so on. A kind of three-tier sentencing policy would be likely to emerge. Again, in terms of deterrent effect, that would not be a very satisfactory or sensible way for the law to develop.<br><br>
Finally on that point, we must consider the position at the end of a murder trial. It is not easy to sit through a murder trial, even as a comparative non-combatant, as I have had to do professionally on occasions. To find a man guilty on a charge of murder is always a highly emotional matter. If we are to complicate the end of a murder trial—I make no apology for dealing with it in this mechanistic way—in terms of pleas in mitigation from counsel it would become extremely important.<br><br>
The Committee will appreciate that there is only one mandatory sentence at present, but presumably if there were to be a normal recommendation in almost all cases the pressure to have the right to address his Lordship on what that minimum should be—to make in effect, a plea in mitigation—would become overwhelming. That, in the very difficult and emotional circumstances at the end of a murder trial, would frankly cause demonstrations of horror from the galleries, certain distress from the families connected with the accused party. It would put an unreasonable burden on the judges, and might not lead to circumstances in which the right decisions would always be reached.<br><br>
Many other arguments could be advanced, but my conclusion is that it would be wrong to have a recommended minimum sentence as being normal in the courts at the end of a murder trial.<br><br>
I turn to the important amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, who wants to go considerably further in the other direction. What he is saying is not that we should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0676">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1137</span>
eschew the opportunity of making it normal practice but that we should remove from the courts altogether the power that exists at present and use it only in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
I have quoted the report of Lord Justice Edmund Davies. That clearly is against the argument put by my hon. Friend. On a fair interpretation, Lord Justice Edmund Davies thought that there was virtue, in exceptional circumstances, in making such a recommendation.<br><br>
I have some worries about the present position. I do not entirely endorse the views of the Solicitor-General for Scotland that we should on occasion shoot someone "pour décourager les autres" He got very near to saying that, because he seemed to be arguing that the public needed reassurance, that therefore it was important to be seen to be doing something, and that the sentencing policy should be heavily influenced by the need to reassure the public in that sense. That is a dangerous argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While there is always such an element in all forms of punishment in respect of murder, which is notorious, I think that the public may require to be reassured in respect of a certain individual. That is the matter to which I was addressing myself, not that one takes a particular individual "pour décourager les autres". There is always a certain amount of deterrence, not only of the person but of others, but that was not my point. My point was that there are certain individuals whose deeds are so notorious that the public must be reassured that it is safe from them for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I see that argument. The Solicitor-General for Scotland gives great weight to it, but I do not. If one is to have a life sentence and if the message is to go out, as the Solicitor-General for Scotland suggested, that a life sentence can be a life sentence, and if one is to trust the parole board and the authorities to manage these matters across the wide range, I am not sure that there is a strong case for retaining a certain piece of mechanism for specific cases. There is an argument but I am not sure that it is a strong argument.<br><br>
There are advantages in getting rid of this piece of mechanism altogether. Perhaps I could say why I have some sympathy with the arguments of my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
Member for Renfrewshire, West. If there is a minimum recommended sentence, it becomes a maximum in the mind of the person on whom it has been passed. In other words, if a man is told "You shall serve 20 years as a minimum," when the 20 years are up he will expect to be released. That puts the whole system in some difficulties if he has not developed under prison training in the way hoped for. It is difficult to say to him "Look here, you forget that when the judge said 20 years, that was a recommended minimum that you should serve, and we are going to take up the option and make sure that you serve for considerably longer."<br><br>
In the nature of things, if the 20 years ticks past, there would then be a very discontented and difficult prisoner to deal with in the period which he has to serve beyond the recommended minimum. It is undoubtedly true that within a short time the prisoner has converted that minimum into a maximum, and he expects to be out.<br><br>
There is the mirror image of that. If there is a recommended minimum—even though I know, the Solicitor-General for Scotland knows, and everyone in the Committee knows, that the minimum has no statutory authority and that it can be overborne by the parole board—situations can arise where someone who has been recommended for a minimum sentence of 20 years has done extremely well in training. The parole board may have it in mind to release him after, say, 17 or 18 years, but feel that it cannot be done in terms of public response and attitudes because there has been a recommended minimum. It builds in an inflexibility in the prisoner's expectations which, if not met, will lead, I fear, to trouble in the prisons. Although the parole board knows that it can overrule that minimum, it will be reluctant to do so. Its judgment about what is right for the individual and right for society may be distorted and warped by the fact that the recommendation exists.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a considerable case for what my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, has been arguing. My understanding is that no minimum recommended by a court has yet been breached by the parole board. If we went for a recommendation in almost every case, inevitably there would come a point where the parole board had to quarrel with the minimum imposed by a trial judge. That would not only be bad for the parole board; it would also be bad for the judicial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
system. In the wider argument on the first two amendments, that is another reason for departing from the recommendations made by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member to address himself to this question? Suppose we accept, as I suggested, that there are worse and less worse murders, and dangerous and less dangerous murderers. If the hon. Member has no system of recommendation in any case, the court will treat all the cases as if they were bad or not as bad, and all the murderers as bad or not as bad. I should like the hon. Gentleman to address himself to that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is an argument on the other side although, on balance, I am coming down with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West. However, I do not think that it is right to say that the courts need treat all murderers on the same basis. There are such things as <i>obiter,</i> where the judge may make it clear. Twenty years is only a recommendation; it is a very inflexible form of recommendation. When the judge sentences the man to life imprisonment, he may be able to express a view to which he wishes the authorities to pay attention. In the report which he compiles at the time, he has the opportunity to make his views clear.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) made an important point: a life sentence will always be for a long period. I regard even three or four years in prison as a long time. Men's personalities, their performances and their ability to adapt and respond to social situations, demands and pressures, can change enormously in that time. I want to reduce the judge's role in this matter. The judge must monitor the trial and ensure that the law is properly stated to the jury who make the decision. The judge then has a mandatory sentence to impose.<br><br>
I accept everything that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said about the illogicality of our system. It is not only between culpable homicide and murder; it is also between bank robbery and murder. The Solicitor-General for Scotland talked about the Lygate case in our previous sitting. Sometimes I think that we have a warped sentencing policy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
which is reflected in sentences of 20 years and upwards for robbery and robbery with violence. But that is a side issue.<br><br>
We have to decide the best way of dealing with people convicted of murder. I am satisfied that that best way is an open-ended life sentence, where people can monitor the progress of the man convicted and give him maximum support and get him out into the community as quickly as possible. On balance, I believe that it is better to do that without the recommendation of a minimum sentence from the courts. I shall vote on that basis.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to my own amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the hon. Gentleman, in the interest of brevity? His amendment seeks to remove subsection (4). Having considered the matter, even without the benefit—or perhaps because of the benefit—of not hearing his argument, I am happy to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist responding to that handsome compliment from the Solicitor-General for Scotland. I was glad to see that his anxious mandarin face turned into a surprisingly sweet smile when he looked at my amendment. Perhaps it will become an important source document for those who in the years ahead study the activities of the Solicitor-General for Scotland.<br><br>
I am glad that the Solicitor-General for Scotland accepts my amendment. It is worth putting on the record what the amendment is and will be in the statute.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
It was an extraordinary proposal—that if someone convicted of murder was sentenced to life imprisonment and, as part of that sentence, no minimum requirement as to length of sentence was made by the judge, and if the unfortunate man then appealed against his conviction to the High Court of Justiciary, the court could decide to impose a minimum requirement which the trial judge had not thought suitable. That was an extraordinary proposal, for, if there is any conceivable merit in the minimum recommendation, it is that it comes from the judge who has listened to all the evidence and can judge what is appropriate in the light of all the circumstances.<br><br>
While I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for saying that he will accept the

amendment when we reach that stage—it may not be relevant if the major amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr.Buchan) is carried, but I am glad that at least there is a fall-back position in that subsection (4) will go—may I record my utter astonishment that the subsection appeared in the Bill at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the most graceful acknowledgement that I have heard any hon. Member make to a Minister of the acceptance of his amendment.<br><br>
It is not my intention to speak on clause stand part, because I believe that the matter that we are now debating is the central feature of the clause. Whether my hon. Friends speak on clause stand part is a matter for themselves, but I shall content myself with making some remarks on amendment No. 244, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).<br><br>
The debate is about whether the present system is working and gives reassurance to the public that society is properly protected from those who violate our society by committing murder, or whether the public feel that they are not properly protected. I take issue with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker)—I feel that he will follow a particular line during the whole of this Parliament and that I should leave him to follow it—but I would draw a comparison between his comments on amendments Nos. 49 and 50 and the comments so often made about the working of children's panels. For every speech made in the terms in which the hon. Member made his speech, there are fewer and fewer people who will believe that the present system is working.<br><br>
I argue that the present system is indeed working. Far from having to make an intelligent guess about what would happen, we have good figures to prove that, particularly since the Parole Board was established in 1967, there has been some success as a result of the release of life prisoners. We can even check the rate at which they have been recalled and all the details surrounding 99 or 100 life prisoners who have been released by the Parole Board since 1967.<br><br>
I am minded, like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to support amendment No. 244. I have the feeling that the Solicitor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
General, in putting this provision in the Bill, has taken a fairly major step back from the commitment given in the Conservative Party manifesto. In any case, what is in the Bill does not mean all that much. There is, therefore, no reason, in my view, for its being in the Bill. If the Solicitor-General wishes to intervene when I have developed my argument, I shall willingly give way and return to those points later.<br><br>
Let me first sketch in the present position. A High Court judge now has discretion, if he so desires, to attach a recommendation of a minimum sentence. It is seldom done, but it has been done on occasion. In my view, the clause is saying much the same thing: that the High Court judge will have discretion— because it says "may" and not "shall"—to attach a recommendation for a minimum sentence. That happens now, and that is why I am saying that the position is not really changed by the Bill. I agree with my hon. Friend that the provisions ought to be taken out.<br><br>
Those who are sentenced to life imprisonment, as the Solicitor-General rightly said, are indeed life prisoners. Never during the whole of their natural life, are they free from justice. They may be released from prison but, equally, they may be recalled without committing an offence. They can be recalled if, in the opinion of social workers or the police, their conduct has deteriorated but they have not offended. That has happened on a number of occasions since 1967.<br><br>
The most up-to-date figures that I have say that since 1967 99 life prisoners have been released on the advice of the Parole Board. Of that 99 life prisoners who have been released, 85 have given absolutely no cause for public concern. That is a fairly high percentage. Fourteen of the 99 were recalled because their conduct had deteriorated. Of that 14, only five had committed further offences.<br><br>
We are talking about only five life prisoners out of a total of 99 who committed further offences after being released by the Parole Board under the present system. That leads me to the conclusion that far from the present system not working, particularly as the Parole Board system, which was established in 1967, has developed, the present system is indeed working.<br><br>
If only some of us—sometimes I include myself in this—would give the system more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1143</span>
credit for the work that it does, we might in the process give the Parole Board and the work it does more credibility in the eyes of the public. That is absolutely vital if we are to breed confidence in the system that, after all is said and done, Parliament was responsible for establishing.<br><br>
I agree with the Solicitor-General that it is really daft to talk in averages when we are talking about life imprisonment. I share the Solicitor-General's view that we should talk in specifics, because there are a number of life prisoners in Scottish prisons who have served very, very long sentences.<br><br>
I can give some figures that no doubt the Committee will find interesting. One person has served 20 years; one has served 18 years; two have served 14 years; four have served 13 years; six served have 12 years; 12 have served 11 years; 12 have served 10 years; 19 have served nine years; and we have the astonishing figure of one prisoner having served 26 years. I sometimes wonder if people appreciate exactly what life inside prison is like.<br><br>
I used often to say that one of the greatest deterrents for keeping people out of prision would be to let them see what it is like inside. I used to plead that if only we could open the prisons to the women's guilds and men's associations and all those other people, to let them see exactly what the inside of a prison is like, I am absolutely sure that we should have a great deal more informed comment, and in the process we should have a great deal less criticism. Prisons are anything but the first-class hotels that many people would have us believe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, because part of our duty is to give and confirm public confidence. The figures which the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has quoted must be set against the fact that the Homicide Act was passed in 1957. The maximum time that a person could have been in prison, assuming that he committed an offence after the abolition of the death penalty, is 23 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the correction, but I am sure that the man who has served 26 years does not quite see the fine point that the Solicitor-General is making.<br><br>
I am not anxious to detain the Committee, so I come now, rather quickly, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1144</span>
the physical management problems of dealing with prisoners who have been sentenced to life imprisonment. We are not here talking about people who have had sentence passed on them which is subject to remission. There can be absolutely no doubt that the one great carrot that is held out to many prisoners is the possibility that a third of their sentence will be chopped off if they behave themselves.<br><br>
That is not the case with life prisoners. I am sure that all the advocates on the Committee know the problems that life prisoners present. As I said in an earlier debate, once the court case headlines have disappeared from the press, we hear precious little about the continuing problem. There are very serious and continuing problems, particularly management problems, in dealing with life prisoners. If there is any attempt to develop a system whereby recommendations for minimum sentences are attached, almost <i>ad lib,</i> I am certain without fear of contradiction that this will in itself lead to major management problems in our penal system.<br><br>
I accept that what we are doing in this Committee is reforming the criminal law. But at the same time we must not shed our responsibility, while reforming the criminal law, of helping the penal system. If we do anything that damages the penal system in the process of reforming the criminal law, Parliament will have to answer for it.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's role is not unimportant. Again, I sometimes wonder whether people know exactly what his role is in this matter. At present, when a High Court judge attaches a recommendation for a minimum sentence, that does not preclude the Secretary of State from consulting the trial judge if he is available. If the trial judge is not available, the normal procedure is to consult the Lord Justice-General. It does not preclude the Secretary of State from consulting either the trial judge or the Lord Justice-General, then sending the case to the parole board for consideration for parole. Nothing in this clause will alter the powers of the Secretary of State to do that if the Secretary of State is so inclined.<br><br>
There are many life imprisonment cases—indeed, my understanding is that the Secretary of State continues the procedure—which he personally considers at intervals. Sometimes the Secretary of State will send a case to the parole board, not for consideration for parole, but for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1145</span>
information only. In no circumstances can the parole board recommend parole. If the Secretary of State sends a case to the parole board for information only, there are no circumstances in which the parole board, even exercising the function for which it was established in 1967, can recommend parole. It is only when the Secretary of State sends a case to the parole board without any recommendation that the matter then lies in the hands of the parole board. Thus, the Secretary of State is a central figure in everything that we are discussing at present.<br><br>
That leads me to my final comment. I am convinced that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has done the Committee a service. I do not say that in any patronising way. The Solicitor-General for Scotland deserves our thanks and a tribute for the very constructive way in which he has joined in our debate on this clause.<br><br>
Again, I am grateful to him for the speech he made when we were considering this matter against the background of the kind of commitments that we were given in early 1979.<br><br>
In my view, the present system is working. If those of us who appear to have some sway with the public would be prepared to persuade them that it was working, I am sure that we would do a much better job than by running it down. Against that background, I have come along the road that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has travelled, and I am prepared to support my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West in his amendment.</span></p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with fundamentals. With great respect to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and the other members of the Committee, I caution them greatly against changing the present permissive minimum recommendation.<br><br>
No such suggestion was made a year ago by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth—the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) was not on the Committee, so I excuse him. No such suggestion was made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), and I am certain that the Law Lords in another place would have paused greatly if they had thought that all dis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1146</span>
posals of murder—be they domestic and to a certain extent forgivable or obscene and frightful—should be indistinguishable in the disposal of a sentence to imprisonment for life.<br><br>
I urge most strongly on the Committee that so long as the law of homicide—and indeed the law of assault—is split into various categories, of which murder is one, there must be the imprimatur of the the sentence that the taking of life is something which commits a person to imprisonment for life, in order to demonstrate our belief in the sanctity of life. Each of us has only one life. That is why we have the appalling sentence of imprisonment for life.<br><br>
At the same time, in order that we shall exercise our mercy and our humanity, we must reserve some way—in the cases of such persons as Samuel Gilbert McCloy, who frightened so many people in the east end of Glasgow by the murders of which he was found guilty—by which the court can say, taking account all the circumstances, " We view this man as such a threat to public safety that the public are entitled to be reassured by a minimum recommendation."<br><br>
I urge the Committee not to support the abolition of all minimum recommendations, so that all murders—domestic murders and murders of horrific kinds and public threat—are treated equally. I urge the Committee to reject the recommendation, and I urge, with all the hope I can, the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West to seek to withdraw the amendment. I am certain that, to achieve a situation in which the public have confidence in rejecting or drawing back from the recommendations of the Emslie Committee, we cannot in all conscience leave the court defenceless in making its feelings clear, and expressing the genuine desire of the public for safety in the future. We cannot allow that to be removed by the abolition of the minimum recommendation. This minimum recommendation is rarely used, and I believe has never been wrongly used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I have inadvertently misled the Committee. My hon. Friend the Whip tells me that I cannot vote, so all that I can say is that if I were able to vote I would support my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1147</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to come in at a junior level after my hon. and learned Friend has attempted to wind up the debate, but I hope it will be excusable for me to put two brief thoughts into the mind of the Committee before we come to a vote.<br><br>
I have been impressed by the manner in which the Committee has combined to accept the depth of philosophical and practical issues that we are debating. Reports of this debate deserve wide circulation among the people of Scotland.<br><br>
I touch on two points. The first was raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), when he pointed to the difficulties that could arise if there was a mandatory recommendation in every murder trial. I entirely agree with him that this would lead to a most unfortunate procedure whereby counsel, immediately following the verdict, would have to embark on a plea in mitigation for a lesser period of recommendation. I think that we would all accept that, once a verdict is given in a murder trial, there is emotional exhaustion on the part of the accused, the counsel, the jury and, indeed, the judge, and it is neither the time nor the place for such pleas to be embarked upon. Such facts will be duly explored by the parole board if necessary in due course, but they should not be raised following conviction at trial.<br><br>
My other point concerns the danger of the tariff mentality. Here I cite from my own experience. I was involved in a case where a man was accused and found guilty of murder. It was the murder of a member of another family with whom his family had had a running feud for a number of years. The accused's precognition was one of the most chilling pieces of literature that I have ever had to read, because he made clear that the victim was one in a series of targets he had in mind until such time as he could eliminate the entire family. He said "Even if I am found out for this murder, it does not worry me because at worst I am likely to get a sentence which will mean, in effect, a sentence of imprisonment for eight years and after I have done my eight years I can come and and murder the next member of the family".<br><br>
Such a dangerous psychopath would probably not be allowed out to see the light of day again, but the point is that he thought had an opportunity to kill at will, serve his time and carry on repeating
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1148</span>
the process.<br><br>
That is why I back the Solicitor-General in saying that we have a very high duty in this Committee to reassure the people of Scotland that that kind of criminal psychopathic approach will not be allowed to have its way, that the courts and Parliament will see to it that such people can be kept safely incarcerated for the protection of the public.<br><br>
My view, therefore, is that it is right and proper that the Government should restate their commitment to giving the judiciary the power to make a recommendation if and when it considers it appropriate. But there are severe practical difficulties in making it a mandatory requirement, and in this case I believe that the Government have got the matter entirely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know, Mr. Gourlay, that you think I speak at very great length, but I doubt whether I spoke for more than three or four minutes at the start. The debate has been one of the best throughout the Bill's proceedings and I want to pay special tribute to the Solicitor-General's speech. Indeed, I thought that his argument throughout was in support of my proposition. He then fell back a little from that position on, I think the ground of public confidence and public fear, and I want to deal with that aspect first, taking along with it the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).<br><br>
It is clear that a mandatory recommendation will have precisely the opposite effect. Davies got it right. He said:<br><br>
—that is the mandatory recommendation in each case—
<br><blockquote><p>"may diminish the deterrent effect and undermine public confidence … if it appears on the face of it, to those who do not know all the facts of the case, and who perhaps rely on headlines in the press, that, for example, four years is recommended as the period to be served by a murderer."</p></blockquote>
It seems self-evident that a mandatory recommendation can only diminish the deterrent effect and not enhance it. At the most, courts will be talking in terms of 15 years and at the best they will be dropping the sentence to two years or four years for the obvious reasons that that was the general outline.<br><br>
Therefore, all Committee members seem to be in agreement. I know that it costs a good deal for certain Conservative Members to say so—above all, the Solicitor-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1149</span>
General for Scotland—because of their own involvement and background in relation to this policy. The Opposition must welcome that and recognise that it has not always been easy to cross that line.<br><br> Secondly, I accept completely what the Solicitor-General for Scotland said in discussing the problem in relation to murder being a simple thing. It was De Quincey who wrote
<br><blockquote><p>"Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts."</p></blockquote>
Murder is a simple thing, as is culpable homicide. The degrees of variation and the kind of people involved are such that it is not a crime for which one can ever say that murder should have 15 years and culpable homicide seven and a half. It is not like that. As Hamlet said,
<br><blockquote><p>"it hath the primal eldest curse upon't."</p></blockquote>
That is how people react. Therefore it should have the imprimatur of society in saying that the answer is life. I accept that it is qualitatively different from other crimes.<br><br>
Even in accepting that it is qualitatively different from other crimes, we also recognise that in some circumstances it may not be so bad, if it is possible to explain that. The Solicitor-General for Scotland was right to say that a man who tosses a grenade into a crowded pub, even if no one is hurt, is worse and more deserving of punishment than the wife who is pushed beyond endurance and reacts with a knife against her husband.<br><br>
The situation resulting from the grenade in the pub may be worse—30 people may be injured but none of them killed, by an accident of fate and the skill of the surgeon. There could be an enormous difference. But that underlines my case and does not detract from it. If we say, on the one hand, that society wants to express its view on the crime which is qualitatively different and at the same time recognises that crime has such gradations of evil within it that it cannot be judged in advance for the kind of punishment, there is only one solution. The imprimatur must be life—full stop. We cannot say that the passing of a life sentence accompanied by a minimum recommendation is life—full stop. It is not taken in that way by the public. It does dent the qualitative difference that we are trying to make. So I do not believe that we can argue both cases.<br><br>
The problem is that when the announce-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1150</span>
ment of the recommendation is made, we know, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) pointed out, that it is taken as a maximum recommendation. The press headline says "Fifteen years for Johnny Waddell"— or whatever his name may be. It does not say "A minimum sentence of 15 years". The headline is "Fifteen years". He believes that it is 15 years, his relations believe that it is 15 years and the press has reinforced that belief. Johnny Waddell goes in with that assumption.<br><br>
That puts an intolerable strain on the prisons. Secondly, it is self-defeating in its aim and purpose. It has not added to the awfulness of the crime and murder: it is equating murder with long sentencing. I think I am right in saying that the longest sentence passed in Scottish courts was 23 or 24 years in the Matt Lygate case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The minimum recommendation was in the case of Mr. Howard Wilson. If his sentence is grossed up, it comes to about 40 years. That appears to be the longest.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was ex-Inspector Wilson, yes.<br><br>
We therefore are not in disagreement about the importance of reassuring the public. We are in disagreement whether the public are reassured by having a minimum recommendation made. In all circumstances, I regard this as detracting. If it dents and breaks the imprimatur that we seek to put on this particular crime, the matter does not stop there. A judge can express sympathy in the case of a housewife pushed beyond endurance, just as he can express his horror at a particularly foul crime. That kind of expression, along with a life sentence, will carry the right kind of response.<br><br>
It is a problem that the judges themselves recognise. The judges do not want to have this duty imposed upon them. They want the freedom to be able to make remarks and they will continue to do so whether there is a recommendation or not, but not in terms of the formalities of the recommendation.<br><br>
Everything now points to the Committee taking a bold decision and accepting the amendment, and saying, as I believe almost everyone who spoke accepted, that it is right that the sentence should be left at life.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0683">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1151</span>
We are reinforced in that view because under the present structure the judge prepares a report when the judgment is made which can be used by the Parole Board. I am responsible for the board's establishment in Scotland. The Parole Board can have that report and the recommendation can come before the board then. That is when it should be used.<br><br>
The Parole Board cannot use that section of the report which could affect the executive and its body in making the right decision. We cannot allow that to be affected in order to make the wrong decisions. The method of allaying public fear is the life sentence.<br><br>
The press has a responsibility in this, too. It fought for press freedom last week to be able to publish the names of juveniles. The Committee has the task of getting beyond the headlines to say that life means life. If a man is released later—it does not always happen—he is still serving a life sentence in the sense that he is released on licence. The press can help in that to allay public fear. It would be wrong to have that fear of a press response misguiding the public and thus preventing proper rehabilitatory measures from being taken in relation to our prisoners.<br><br>
All the arguments show that we must make a bold decision and welcome the acceptance of the removal of subsection (4). I hope that Conservative Members will not vote against it going the whole way by saying that it is wrong that this should be either laid down as a duty upon the judge at the trial or done permissively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up the argument that appears to be deduced by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock), and by the Solicitor-General for Scotland against my hon. Friend's amendment.<br><br>
There are situations where the public should be protected and their fears allayed about particularly vicious individuals. The Solicitor-General cited various examples without giving names. When a life sentence is passed—we know that in nearly every case it is not a life sentence—it is surely up to the parole boards and the Secretary of State to take the circumstances into account.<br><br>
If Conservative Members, particularly the Solicitor-General for Scotland and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1152</span>
saying that there are individuals who, 10,12,14 years after committing an offence have not improved, and nobody thinks that they are fit to be released into society, I have to say two things. First, it may be the most serious indictment on the rehabilitation processes in our prison service. I do not believe that that is so. There are major faults in our prisons in terms of overcrowding and rehabilitation. Clearly, there must be a much greater effort to rehabilitate long-term prisoners.<br><br>
Secondly, as hon. Members are suggesting, it may be that these people are incapable of being rehabilitated. They have a personality and mental defect which is so powerful that they cannot be altered by the prison sentence. I believe that that is more likely. If that is so they do not require to be imprisoned but need psychiatric treatment. It may not solve the problem. These people have a personality defect which is so strong that they cannot be helped by the normal role played by a prison sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pollock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the comments made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). If he casts his mind back to the days of capital punishment, he will recall the notorious mass-murderer Peter Thomas Anthony Manuel. He was found sane and fit to plead. But all the evidence I have read—I have studied the case with considerable care—suggests that even with the best will in the world psychiatry could not have transformed him into a man who could be released. While I do not doubt the hon.<br><br> Gentleman's good intentions, I think, to some extent, his remarks are flying in the face of reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the person should be in a psychiatric rather than in a penal institution, because that is where he may be cured. In some circumstances he will not be cured. Many mental patients in mental institutions have committed no offences but they are insane and will spend all their lives there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and the Committee should consider this fact. When a person has been committed to a mental institution as a result of committing a violent crime—psychopaths are not normally sent to such institutions because they are registered as incurable—and he escapes and commits

another violent crime, he would always be found sane and fit to plead and be sent to prison thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. We have to be clear in terms of penal policy on rehabilitation. If we are not, we have to consider what we are to do about it. If, in any circumstances, one starts to lay down minimum sentences, it makes re-</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"and without referring the case to a children's panel for consideration and advice."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is defectively drafted. That does not perhaps make it stand out in the proceedings of the Committee, but it is, I am afraid, somewhat staggered in its effort. I put it down because the subject is worth a brief discussion and I wished to hear a little about the Government's attitude.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State in charge of these matters recently put out a consultative paper on children's panels, in which he invited public discussion about their continuing role and their remit. It is in the spirit of that invitation that I put down the amendment.<br><br>
Clause 43 deals with the detention and release on licence of children convicted on indictment. We are, of course, dealing here with children who are in much more serious trouble than those who normally appear before a children's panel. For all that, they are under 16 and, having been</span></p>

<p>habilitation difficult because the person has no hope of being released in less than 15 years. Therefore, he says "I shall start my rehabilitation after 15 years, and not before".</p>
<p>For those reasons I shall be supporting my hon. Friend's amendment.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 7.</p>
<p>sentenced by a court, they are placed under treatment. In terms of subsection (1), they are
<br><blockquote><p>"detained … on such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>If they are under 16, it is extremely likely that they will end up in a list D school or a similar institution.</p>
<p>When their release on licence comes to be considered, subsection (3) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person has been sentenced under subsection (2 (1) above to be detained for a period exceeding 18 months"</p></blockquote>
and the time comes for his release on licence, the Secretary of State shall release him only on the recommendation of the Parole Board for Scotland. I have no objection to the Parole Board for Scotland being involved in the process, but I am not sure that the children's panel might not also have an appropriate role in advising. I can see that there might be objections because the person might no longer be a child: the 18 months may have taken him beyond the age of 16. We would have to consider that, and I am certain that my proposal would need a good deal of tidying up. The Solicitor-General, even if he were prepared to give it a favourable glance, might prefer to leave it to a general reconsideration of the powers and activities of the children's panels.</p>
<p>However, I believe that there is virtue in the children's panel being asked to consider the position of a youngster who has spent a considerable period—given the length of the sentence that the clause stipulates to bring the child within its terms—under treatment. That is a non-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1155</span>
penal situation, for presumably the child will be in a school receiving support and social work guidance of some kind. It would be not inappropriate for the children's panel to be involved in the decision, in the public interest and in the interest of the child—which, presumably, is still an important consideration.</p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>It would, of course, involve the young person's parents being brought into the discussion. They would, clearly, be present at any children's hearing considering his case. That might seem at first glance to be an impediment because it would not be normal, for example, for an adult prisoner being considered for parole to have his family consulted at first hand.</p>
<p>But we are talking here of juveniles, and surely, in the parole process, the reports on home background are extremely valuable and no doubt an important part of the brief which the parole board has to consider. It would, I think, be perfectly right to say that, when dealing with children, and given that the success of any licence arrangement that might be entered into would very much depend on the level of parental support and the willingness and ability of the parents to cope with the resettlement and personality problems of the child, there might be positive advantages in having a children's hearing at the stage when parole or licence was being considered so that the parents could be brought into the act and put on the spot as to their feelings and what support they might be able to give.</p>
<p>It is, I recognise, a slightly controversial proposal. I run it to gauge reactions, but in this rather narrow situation of a person under 16 being considered for licence it would be no bad thing to link the Parole Board for Scotland to children's panel hearings. It might be good for both bodies and might also increase the depth of investigation and breadth of the advice available to the Secretary of State, who finally has to take the decision in an individual case.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps because I am an episcopalian Jacobite Scot I have always been a rather sceptical person. I have always been sceptical of the phrase, used by Governments, that this drafting is deficient, but I have never known an amendment which, if I accepted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1156</span>
it in its present form, would so much achieve the exact opposite of what is intended. However, I will be kind enough to the hon. Gentleman to resist it for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is only for that reason, I am grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting concept that the children's panel should be involved in the word of the parole board when a child has been sentenced on indictment to imprisonment on a serious offence. But I do not think that it would be appropriate. In such a case the panel would not have been involved in the matter at all; it would not, <i>de facto,</i> have been part of the disposal; it would not have been involved in any way at all in the offence.<br><br>
There can be too many spectators of good will involved. I appreciate the hon. Member's good intentions, but I think that the parole board has just as well qualified persons to judge, and in any after-care that may by statute or otherwise be required, the parents will be involved. I do not think, therefore, that to bring a children's panel into the work of the parole board at that stage would be particularly beneficial to the child or in any other way beneficial.<br><br>
It would, of course, be very costly and would probably involve a great deal of extra work for the children's panels. Those that I have attended have far more to do than they can really carry out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there was a splendid inconsistency or gap between the intention and execution so far as the drafting of this amendment was concerned. I should offer an apology to the Committee. It was dictated over the phone. No doubt it was my fault. I do not think there is anything wrong, in our rather long, grim and determinedly well-intentioned deliberations, to have a little eccentricity on this side of the Committee as well as on the Government Benches in the person of the Solicitor-General for Scotland.<br><br>
I do not repent having raised the issue. It is one to which we can perhaps give further consideration when we are looking at the powers of children's panels. I was interested to hear what the Solicitor-General said. I recognise that we should not rush to deal with this matter. In the

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 301, in page 35, line 30, leave out from "is" to "imposed" in line 32, and No. 302, in page 35, line 37, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and any such additional period of detention will run concurrently with the period of detention being served by the convicted person in terms of the said subsection (5).</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now entering a very important clause which marks a considerable change in penal policy if it reaches the statute book. The best thing I can do is to take these amendments fairly narrowly at this stage and reserve my remarks about the general implications, which are serious and important, to a genuine clause stand part debate at a later stage.<br><br>
Amendment No. 300 is simple to describe. It merely attempts to reduce the maximum period for which a person can be sentenced to detention from four months
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1158</span>
to three months. I recognise the Government's enthusiasm for the detention centre and what is now enshrined in the good book of cliches as the short, sharp, shock approach.<br><br>
As the Solicitor-General for Scotland will recognise, at present if a boy is sent for a holiday to Glenochil, the maximum period that can be imposed is three months. It is a sentence that is well understood. It is subject to remission in the normal way for good conduct and normally one would expect to be there for two months.<br><br>
I appreciate that there is always a case for saying that we should give the maximum flexibility possible to the court. There is no reason why we should not allow a slightly larger span. But if one is going in for a short, sharp shock—the idea is that this is a once, and a once only, visit—I think that it should be a much-restricted visit. I thought that the three-month detention centre was a perfectly sensible proposition. I am not convinced that the extension of the upper limit at a detention centre from three months to four months is justified. Subject to returning later if further arguments emerge, I suggest that we should look fairly cynically at this proposal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 301 was badly drafted by me. I expected it to be drafted in another form. In effect, it seeks to omit the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) for a period of less than 28 days;"</p></blockquote>
Why I did not merely say "leave out line 31" passes my understanding. That is why I was momentarily taken aback. Again, this is a simple amendment. It is a matter of common sense and judgment.<br><br>
