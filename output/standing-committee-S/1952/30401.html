OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed,
<br><blockquote><p>"That if the proceedings on the University of St. Andrews Bill [<i>Lords</i>] are not completed at this day's Sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesday, 22nd April, at Half-past Ten o'Clock."—[<i>Mr. J. Stuart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious to co-operate in this matter. Occasionally unforeseen speeches occur during Scottish Grand Committee proceedings, and it may not always be possible to plan methodically and exactly so as to finish at the desired time. But my hon. Friends will exercise a self-denying ordinance. We realise that the controversial points of this Bill may be discussed extensively on Committee stage.</span></p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. James Stuart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Chairman do now report to the House that the University of St. Andrews Bill [<i>Lords</i>] has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to take up too much time, because I think it is in the general interest that we should complete this part of our proceedings today. As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) has said, some of the points which may give rise to difference of opinion will be suitable matters for discussion in Committee.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies will regret the introduction of legislation dealing with the independent universities, but there is no doubt about the necessity for it. I am glad to think, however, that we all have the best interests of university education in Scotland at heart, and I hope that on the general principles there will be no party division.<br><br>
I do not wish to trouble the Committee with a detailed account of the difficulties which have spread over a number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2320</span>
years. Anyone who wishes to study them will find them very carefully set out, both in the Report of Lord Cooper and in the report of the Royal Commission. I must, however, deal briefly with certain points.<br><br>
It is as long ago as 1889 that Parliament had to legislate on matters concerning the organisation of the Scottish universities. No Government would willingly embark on such a matter without very weighty reasons. But the controversy has reached such a pitch that it is now endangering the future of St. Andrews University. All previous attempts to resolve these difficulties by negotiation have broken down. The Government feel that if harmony is to be restored certain defects in the university's constitution which are at the root of the trouble must be removed by legislative action.<br><br>
The trouble originated some 60 years ago when the old colleges in St. Andrews were united with the new University College in Dundee. This union was never a happy one. From the passing of the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889 up to the promulgation of the new constitution in 1897 there was wrangling and acrimonious discussion about the arrangements to be made for the government of the university.<br><br>
These years of dispute ended with a compromise arrangement which did not go to the root of the trouble. The mistake made at that time, in my opinion, was the failure to establish a single unassailable authority in control of the whole university. The college in Dundee was allowed to retain partial autonomy. Another initial error was the failure to draw a clear distinction between the organs of the university and those of the United College. For example, the principal of the United College was made <i>ex officio</i> principal of the university.<br><br>
This rather undecided and muddled distribution of power opened the way for the disharmony which followed. I do not wish to apportion blame to either side. What we desire is an amicable and satisfactory settlement. The Dundee element wish to secure added prestige for the City by the establishment of its own university. They also wish to secure the cultural and technical benefits which they think can be attained only by an independent university in Dundee. The administrators
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2321</span>
in St. Andrews on the other hand were actuated by a natural adherence to tradition and a desire to preserve the distinctive character of the university. Whatever the motives, the resulting disputes threaten grave harm to the university. Therefore, they should be resolved.<br><br>
When Secretary of State for Scotland in the previous Government, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Clackmannan invited Lord Cooper, assisted by two assessors, to inquire into the organisation of university education in Dundee and its relationship with St. Andrews University. Hon. Members will have a copy of that Report. As anyone who knows Lord Cooper would expect, it presents a very clear and able statement of the position. The advice is well reasoned, but, unfortunately, it was not acceptable to the disputing parties and therefore no solution was reached in that way. We owe Lord Cooper a debt of gratitude for the able Report which was produced.<br><br>
The only alternative was to have an authoritative examination to decide on the best course to adopt. Therefore, in 1951 a Royal Commission was appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Tedder. The terms of reference of that Commission were,
<br><blockquote><p>"To inquire into the organisation of University education in Dundee and its relationship with St. Andrews University. and to recommend what changes, if any, should be made in the constitution, functions and powers of the University of St. Andrews, of University College, Dundee, or of any other body or institution concerned."</p></blockquote>
I wish to pay a tribute to Lord Tedder and the distinguished members of his Commission for the energy with which they applied themselves to their task. They lost no time in dealing with the problem, and they have propounded a solution which will be found in the Commission's Report.<br><br>
I think it fair to say that the Report had a good reception. It was supported by the university court, the university senate, the council of University College, Dundee, and by the United College of St. Andrews. I admit that it was not supported by the governors of University College, Dundee, or by the Dundee Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or the university court?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2322</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I am correct in saying that they supported it.<br><br>
After full consideration the Government came to the conclusion that the recommendations of the Commission offered the best hope for the future of university education in both St. Andrews and Dundee. This Bill has been drafted to implement that conclusion. One change which the Bill does not make is that of setting up a separate university in Dundee. The Commission are quite clear on that point. I will quote from their Report:
<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot recommend that separation is needed, still less that it is desirable… Its advocates have failed to prove that the gathering ground is great enough to provide two universities with an adequate intake of students to ensure their growth and vitality… We have decided without hesitation that Lord Cooper was right in rejecting the extreme solution, not because we have failed to appreciate the motives of its advocates or doubted the sincerity of their determination to make it practicable, but because we have not been convinced by their arguments."</p></blockquote>
The difficulties are that there is not room or population to justify the maintenance of separate universities; there are not sufficient students in the area from which to draw, and there is no justification for financing two separate universities. In addition, there are other difficulties, with which I will not deal in any detail, such as facilities for the teaching of medicine and science in two universities.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
If the university is reorganised, as the Bill proposes, I suggest that Dundee should benefit because university education will be so developed that without any new financial burdens the city will enjoy a vigorous and developed academic life within its boundaries. The accepted solution embodied in the Bill provides not for the division of the existing university into two independent parts north and south of the Tay, but for its unification and integration. With this will be coupled a measure of devolution in administration, so that the university can draw upon both the civic spirit in Dundee and the old traditions of St. Andrews. That seems to us to be the right line in the interests of both.<br><br>
The university court will be reconstituted to deal impartially with the several parts of the university, and in future the court should no longer be criticised on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2323</span>
the ground that it is mainly concerned with the colleges in St. Andrews. The present governing bodies of University College, Dundee, will be dissolvd. In thir place the Bill will establish a single unincorporated college in Dundee which will incldude the advanced medical and dental schools.<br><br>
The court will thus be the final authority in the university and there will be two new College Councils, one for the new Dundee college and one for the two St. Andrews colleges. The powers and duties of these councils are laid down in general terms in the Bill.<br><br>
One feature of the reconstitution of the court which has attracted much attention, and to which, no doubt, there will be a good deal of reference before this Bill completes all its stages, is the proposal to replace the rector by the principal in the Chair. I must remind the Committee that under the Bill the principal ceases to be the principal of the United College and is to be appointed by the Crown.<br><br>
The Royal Commission recommended this change and gave very strong reasons for advocating it. To quote just one short extract from the Commission's Report, they recommended that the principal should occupy the chair of the university court:
<br><blockquote><p>"because the special conditions of St. Andrews make it essential. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the Chairmanship of the Court both during the period of reconstruction of the University and later, and, if the position is given to a non-resident officer who is elected triennially, stable government and continuity of policy may be gravely endangered."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee, as I am sure they will, will give very careful thought to these words.<br><br>
The Bill is drafted to follow out the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and, as the Committee will be aware from proceedings in another place, it is the Government's intention to adhere to the recommendations of the Commission for the reasons given. I will not go further into that at this stage except to say that they will very carefully consider this point before coming to any other decision. It must be borne in mind that the new principal, whoever he may be, will have a very onerous and important task to shoulder when he takes on the re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2324</span>
organisation of the university, if and when this Bill becomes law.<br><br>
During the initial period of reorganisation there will be up to six Commissioners appointed by the Crown to undertake the detailed organisation of the university. In the main, these acts of reorganisation will be carried out by ordinance necessitating, in the first place, consultation with the university court, the senatus and the general council. Objections will be considered and ordinances must be laid before Parliament. Therefore, full Parliamentary control is assured.<br><br>
As I said, I do not want to be responsible for delaying the operations of this Committee today. The Committee are aware that owing to reasons outside our control there was some alteration in our business which made it impossible for us to sit yesterday. It would be of great assistance to the Government if we could get through the consideration of the principle of the Bill before Easter and thus be able, after a proper interval, to proceed to the Committee stage after Easter. At the same time, I do not, of course, wish to press that point unduly. We must see how we get along.<br><br>
I do not pretend that the passage of this Bill will at once put an end to all disharmony. That, I am afraid, would be asking too much, but I do believe that the Bill will remove the causes of the disharmony which has existed for so many years. I trust that in the end it will prove to be in the best interests of our oldest university whose well-being, I know, all members of this Committee have so strongly at heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that all Scottish Members of Parliament and, indeed, the majority of people who have the best interests of Scottish education at heart will welcome this Bill, even though some of us may have certain reservations on one or other of the provisions contained in it. I am certain that during this Second Reading and on the Committee stage these reservations will be brought out very clearly indeed.<br><br>
It is true, as the Secretary of State has said, that although there was legislation in 1897 it united the University of St. Andrews and the College of Dundee in name only, and that since that date, over 50 years ago, there has been nothing else
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2325</span>
but dissension and bickering between those two bodies. I hope that when this Bill reaches the Statute Book it will go a long way towards bringing an end to that dissension because where there is dissension in such matters as this it is most detrimental to the best interests of education.<br><br>
I, like the Secretary of State, also wish to pay my tribute to Lord Cooper for the immense and good work which he did. I am very sorry indeed that his findings and recommendations were not accepted. Had they been, it might have meant that by now we should have been on the way to the harmony which we all desire. I also wish to pay a high tribute to Lord Tedder and to the members of his Commission. In eleven months they produced a Report on a problem which to many of us appeared almost insoluble. I do not know of any Royal Commission which has ever worked so hard or so successfully and which has produced a Report so quickly.<br><br>
Having examined the whole Report, it appears to me that the recommendations contained in it are capable of bringing about harmony and doing away with the disunity which has existed for so long. We find that in the recommendations the possibility of a separate university for Dundee is turned down. I agree with that recommendation for the reasons given in the Report and particularly because of the student population. I cannot see how the student population in that area could possibly uphold two universities, one in St. Andrews and one in Dundee.<br><br>
I do not agree with one of the reasons given by the Secretary of State, that St. Andrews was anxious to preserve its traditions. It is, perhaps, a good thing to preserve traditions but not to preserve at the cost of the prestige of another city. Therefore, I do not accept that reason, although I do accept the reason that the student population makes it impossible to uphold two universities. I understand and sympathise with those who feel disappointed at this decision. It is a good and admirable thing that a city should have civic pride and should desire to uphold its prestige, but I think a part of the trouble has been caused by the attitude among the people in Dundee.<br><br>
Although I sympathise with their desire and realise that a city would be doing less than its duty if it did not try
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2326</span>
to uphold its prestige and maintain its civic pride and dignity, I am still convinced that a separate university for Dundee is not a feasible proposition.<br><br>
Under this Bill there will be two councils, one representing the United Colleges of St. Andrews and the other the College of Dundee, and the principal will be in a very different position from the principals in the three other Scottish universities. He will be in an independent position and will be attached to neither college. That is a very wise provision because it seems to me that if he is attached to neither of the colleges he will be in a position to serve the best interests of both. He will not have the interests of one college pulling against the interests of the other as would be the case if he were the head of one of them.<br><br>
If the right man is chosen—that is a very important thing indeed—although he will be faced with immense difficulties, he will also have great opportunities. The Secretary of State is right when he says that the mere passage of this Bill will not in itself do away with the disharmony and the disunity, but, as I have said, the Principal will have great opportunities.<br><br>
Many of the recommendations contained in the Tedder Report do not require legislation, but just as the Government have brought forward this Bill to give effect to the recommendations which require legislation, the desired unity will not be achieved if the recommendations which depend on administration are not carried out. I wish to stress that point this morning.<br><br>
The Commission's recommendations, especially those numbered 26 to 41, deal with the studies which should be carried on by the various colleges. A wise principal will ensure that those recommendations are upheld, and that seems to me one of the biggest jobs that the principal will have to do.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
If these recommendations are upheld and brought into effect the College of Dundee will be in a much better and happier position than it has been for the last 50 years. With the extension of the faculties, and the strengthening of existing faculties in Dundee College, I feel that a higher prestige will be brought to this College of Dundee. I hope that whoever

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2327</span>
is chosen as the principal will do everything he possibly can to implement these recommendations and will have the support of the other persons concerned in this matter.<br><br>
The Secretary of State touched on one or two controversial matters. One point which I should like to raise concerns the position of the rector. Under this Bill the rector is to be put into a different position from that of the rectors in the other three Scottish universities. Instead of his being the chairman of the court the principal is to have that position. I shall leave some of my hon. Friends who feel strongly on this matter to deal with the pros and cons of it, but when we examine Clause 3, in page 3, line 10, we find these words:
<br><blockquote><p>"That person presiding at any meeting of the University Court shall have a deliberative vote and also a casting vote in the case of equality."</p></blockquote>
Under the new constitution of the university court as outlined in this Clause the senatus will have eight representatives, plus the principal, who is to be the chairman. The chairman is to have a deliberative vote and, if necessary, a casting vote.<br><br>
This could mean that the Senatus representatives could, on occasion, obtain a decision against the wishes of every other lay member of the court. I have doubts whether that is a wise provision. It may be said that one would never get a group of professors and lecturers so agreed on any matter that they could combine and get this majority vote, but there may be occasions when that situation will arise, and the principal will then be placed in an almost impossible position. It is for that reason that I ask the Secretary of State to look at this question again. I put it no higher than that.<br><br>
A university does not exist for the interests of professors and lecturers alone. The students and the community have interests that must be safeguarded, and among the lay members on the proposed new court we shall find the Lord Provost of Dundee and the Provost of St. Andrews. In this case Dundee seems to have a higher civic dignity than St. Andrews. Those officers, among others, are representative of the community, and I should never wish to see the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2328</span>
academicians in such a position that they could override the desires of the student and community representation. I do not want to labour this point any further, but for the reasons I have given I hope the Secretary of State will consider this question.<br><br>
I trust that this Bill will have a speedy passage. Lord Tedder at no time claimed that the recommendations of his Commission provided an ideal solution. I do not think Solomon himself could have found an ideal solution to this very difficult problem, but with good will, plenty of common sense and a very wise principal, I think that the future of the great University of St. Andrews will be better and happier than it has ever been in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Walter Elliot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an occasion which is very dear to the hearts of all Scottish Members. We are discussing a subject in which we probably take a more passionate interest than any other, namely, education, and especially university education. It is desirable that we should also remember that we are following in the steps of great and distinguished men and that we are part of a chain of thought and work which goes back into the very dim ages of Scotland and Scottish education. We are directly following up the Bull of Benedict XIII in 1413, and the foundation of the first university in Scotland at the request of King James I.<br><br>
It is an inspiring thought—and one which adds dignity to the proceedings of this Committee—that we are handling a problem of such age and importance to our country, for this is one of the great gateways through which education entered Scotland. I will not concede that it is the only gateway, for in the west, also, we have long traditions of learning which we may claim go back to even earlier times, but they were not incorporated in this way. We certainly concede to St. Andrews, without any question, the position of being the premier university in Scotland in age, in beauty and in certain forms of academic distinction.<br><br>
We have the reinforcement of the work of the Popes and the Kings in the Middle Ages and the great influx of strength, as well as weakness, which was brought to our country by the Industrial Revolution.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2329</span>
The citizens of the great City of Dundee founded Dundee College in 1881. There was a great gap between the early work —the Papal Bull of 1413, the foundation of St. Salvator's College in 1450, St. Leonard's College in 1512 and St. Mary's in 1537—and the founding of Dundee College in 1881. It is from that fact that some of the difficulties with which we are now dealing arise.<br><br>
I do not favour this reorganisation merely for the purpose of resolving a long-continued dispute. There would be a danger in having the University of St. Andrews alone. It might become a backwater, or wither away into a merely interesting medieval survival. It needs the thrust and drive of a great industrial city to complete it, just as the great industrial city needs the dignity and tradition of the older foundation to bring it into the great sequence of our Scottish history of education.<br><br>
I am not specially interested in the argument that this area is not large enough to draw sufficient students to maintain two universities and two colleges, because the University of St. Andrews is already drawing students not merely from all over Scotland but from England and other places outside the boundaries of Scotland. The interest which exists in this University goes far beyond the boundaries even of Europe, because many of its greatest recent endowments have been given from the New World.<br><br>
The mass, the thrust and the drive of the City of Dundee are required by St. Andrews as much as St. Andrews is required by the City of Dundee, and these two things must be kept closely together. That is why I should be against the erection of a new university in Dundee, even though it has all the finance, facilities and arrangements necessary to produce a university.<br><br>
With St. Andrews at its door, on the other side of the Firth, it would be foolish to set up two universities, one at each end of what we hope will be the Tay Road Bridge at no distant date. It would divide two things which were intended to be brought together. I therefore hope very strongly that we shall see a community of spirit as well as of administration resulting from the Bill which is now before us.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2330</span>
There are, however, certain points which we all wish to talk about, and I shall do my best to confine my remarks within the very narrowest limits, in regard to the position of the colleges, the court and the rector. It is true that we shall be able to deal with most of the subjects in Committee, when we come to the detailed consideration of the Bill, and I shall do no more than refer very generally to the problems which are raised.<br><br>
In the consideration of this problem—certainly in another place—uneasiness was felt about the position of the collegiates. This is a collegiate university which is unique in our Scottish universities, and it was felt that we may have been injuring a structure which might be of very great use to us both in itself and as an example to our other universities. There is no doubt that the other universities—certainly the one from which I had the honour to graduate—have become too big and unwieldly. The mass of the University of Glasgow is too great, and it would be an advantage if we could find some method of compartmenting that enormous structure.<br><br>
That view is shared even by the Chairman of the Commission. Lord Tedder, speaking in another place, said that he was taken aback and horrified to find the words "dissolution of the existing Colleges" in the first draft of the Bill. He said that all that had been proposed was the dissolution of the College Corporation, which has not existed, except in form, for many years.<br><br>
I would urge that this question should be re-examined with a view to modifying this provision. We should do our best to see that the collegiate structure is impaired as little as possible, because it is a good thing that there should be colleges and there is a danger in sweeping them away too thoroughly. The position of St. Mary's has been of advantage to the university, and too great an inroad on its powers and prestige might be a bad thing for the new University of St. Andrews which we are trying to bring into existence this morning.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) has referred to the council, the position of the court, and the danger that we might find the general council in a position where they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2331</span>
overridden in the senatus. That brings me to the third point, the position of the Rector. The Secretary of State said that this was a Bill which would not lead to a division upon party lines. I am very glad he intimated that that was so. I realise the responsibility of the Government for backing up the Tedder Commission, because Lord Tedder, as has already been said, did a great work. He worked well and swiftly. So did his Commission. They came to a unanimous Report to which we should give the greatest weight, but I cannot feel on this point that we should necessarily write into an Act of Parliament the recommendation of the Report.<br><br>
It is said that the rector might lead to a lack of stability in the government and in continuity of policy. I myself have had the honour of being the rector of two of our Scottish universities, of Aberdeen and Glasgow. I am not aware that I interfered with the stability of their government. I am not aware that I made inroads into the continuity of their policy. The person chosen as rector has undoubtedly great responsibility. He holds an historic office, which, in times past—let us face it—was a much more active office than it is now; but still it is an important and a great office, and it is an office conferred upon him by the votes of the students. That also goes back a very long way; that was also laid down by Benedict XIII.<br><br>
We should think twice before we make inroads on an institution so old and so respectable, because we differ greatly in this from the University of Aberdeen, which was founded by Alexander Borgia, who, perhaps, will not be regarded as so admirable a founder as Benedict XIII, against whose character, so far as I know, very little is said.<br><br>
It is difficult, of course. The new principal will have a difficult task. I consider that he would have a reinforcement in the rector, occupying his traditional position in the chair of the court. The present Lord Rector of St. Andrews is a man whom any principal would be proud to have as his right hand, a man whom any principal would be proud to sit under if on occasions he took the chair. It is not necessary that the Rector should take the chair. The present Rector of Glasgow University,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2332</span>
who attends frequently, does not take the chair, although he is entitled to do it; he moves himself out of it and the principal thereupon takes the chair.<br><br>
However, it is an ancient office. It is an office which in the past has been of great use. It is an office which brings the student body into direct relationship with the people of great authority and of, I think, considerable renown—present company always excepted—in the counsels of the land. The rectorial election is an interesting occasion for the students, the first time many of them have of exercising a vote. It may be that they do foolish things, but unless people are allowed to do foolish things they will never learn to do wise things. Unless they feel the weight of responsibility upon them they will be rash and irresponsible in exercising it. The position of rector would be weakened if it were held that he was simply an extra figure elected to the court as part of a spree or jamboree on a given day in the winter session by the students.<br><br>
Indeed, it may be very difficult, for he may come to be regarded by the students and by himself as a type of special representative of the students' interests, whose business it is to watch the special interests of the students and the students alone, and put a veto down when some proposal is being produced on which he may think there is some disadvantage to their special interests. That is not the position of the rector just now. He is the second officer in the university, and he does not regard himself as the representative of the students alone, but as a high officer of the university, responsible to the university as a whole.<br><br>
The university is the students. The students are the university. The university is for the purpose of the students. It does not exist for the benefit of the professors. It does not exist for the benefit of the teachers. It exists for the benefit of the body as a whole. I cannot stress too strongly the importance of keeping that always in mind, which is all the more true here. The unifying body in these unhappy bickerings and dissensions has been a student body. It is not the student body that has bickered and quarrelled. It is the student body which has acted as the unifying force, which has always kept in mind the ideal of the university. While the professors rage the students
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2333</span>
unite. It may be said that that is no reason for depriving them of their special position in the university. Rather let the professors take an example from the statesmanlike attitude which the student body has adopted. If anything has to be abolished here it may be some representative of the teaching staff rather than a representative of the taught.<br><br>
However, I do not wish to re-write Scottish education this morning. I think we have a good Bill, a useful Bill; a Bill which is capable of improvement, but a Bill which we should certainly approve in principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. M. Thomson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I shall very often find myself being able to agree with as much of what the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) says as I do this morning. I must say that both in his general remarks on the reorganisation of the university and in his remarks on the issue of the lord rector I find myself in substantial agreement with him.<br><br>
This Bill is not in its most important aspects a Bill for the administrative reorganisation of the university. Perhaps its most important aspect is that of a peace treaty which it is hoped will resolve a civil war. If anybody here is under any impression that the university is a nice, cloistered place where worldly conflicts do not occur I think a reading of the Reports of Lord Cooper and Lord Tedder will quickly disillusion him. The present head of University College, Dundee, is a very distinguished soldier, Major General Wimberley. There must have been times since the end of the war when he must have looked back to his peaceful days with the 51st Division.<br><br>
I wish to draw attention not to the administrative provisions of the Bill but to the need for getting a spirit of acceptance of the changes that are outlined. That spirit of acceptance must, of course, be sought most assiduously in the City of Dundee, because the problem the Bill deals with is primarily a Dundee problem and only secondarily a St. Andrews problem. We must appreciate the very real sense of grievance which the City of Dundee has felt about the administration of the University for many years, and the very genuine and strong feelings people in Dundee have about this grievance.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2334</span>
One does not need to go to a partisan spirit for evidence as to the injustices Dundee has suffered. One can find a number of examples in the Reports of Lord Cooper and of Lord Tedder. Lord Cooper, for instance, says on page 16 of his Report:
<br><blockquote><p>"The indisputable fact is that during its fifty years of association with the University of St. Andrews, University College, Dundee, has not advanced or prospered either materially or culturally to the extent that might reasonably have been expected."</p></blockquote>
Then in paragraph 59 on page 17 the Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We feel bound to record our conclusion that in their treatment of the Arts Departments at Dundee the University has made the worst of both worlds."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 116 Lord Cooper in his summary comes to the conclusion:
<br><blockquote><p>"Over a period of many years, there had been great expansion in St. Andrews and stagnation in Dundee. The result has been the division of the University into a superior and inferior branch, the latter of which has had an insufficient share in the life of the University."</p></blockquote>
Those are strong words. I think that the unhappy situation arose partly out of administrative difficulties that the Secretary of State has outlined this morning, partly out of the fact that the principal of the university in the past has been the principal of St. Andrews College, and partly, I think it must be said, out of the personality of the late principal, Sir James Irvine, who was a very great academic administrator, but who was autocratic in some of his ways, and who was a devoted and, in a sense, an overzealous servant of the St. Andrews side of the university. Lord Tedder in his Report mentions:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are long memories of the years of depression in the city, when there was sharp contrast between the apparently forgotten local College and the University in St. Andrews, then growing both materially and in academic stature under the zealous care of its Principal."</p></blockquote>
The Report goes on later:
<br><blockquote><p>"New post-war difficulties arose about the allocation of the greatly increased Exchequer grants in aid of ordinary recurrent expenditure. These grants, unlike those in aid of specified new capital developments, had to be split by the University itself between its departments on the two sides of the Tay, and there has been a tendency among some in St. Andrews to consider the proportion allocated to University College as simply impoverishing the University by that amount."</p></blockquote>
That was what, I think, Lord Cooper meant when he referred to the fact that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1219">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2335</span>
Dundee's sense of grievance arose out of the fact that she had been treated like a poor relation.<br><br>
It is important that we understand those feelings in Dundee because it is this unhappy history of the relations between the two that has led to the demand for an independent university in the city. I myself was educated in Dundee though not at University College, and I, of course, as a Dundonian would like to see an independent university in Dundee if such a thing were possible and desirable, but I am bound to say that I do not think the severance of Dundee from St. Andrews is the best way to serve the interests of university education either in the city or in Scotland as a whole.<br><br>
My own schooling is near enough for me to realise that the test of reorganisation of university education in Dundee or elsewhere is the quality of the university education provided for our young men and women who go there, and by that test Lord Tedder presents a formidable case for the disadvantage of severance and for the advantages of partnership. He points out a fact that is very often forgotten in the City of Dundee and is not announced as widely as it ought to be, that students in Dundee have always wanted the honour of a degree from a world renowned university. They have always wanted the value in the outside world of a degree from an old university, and Lord Tedder argues very strongly that, if his recommendations are carried out, then the quality of education in both Dundee and St. Andrews can be greatly improved by a policy of partnership.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The advocates of an independent university in Dundee have a number of difficult facts to face which they have not successfully dealt with since the publication of these Reports. In the first place, to set up an independent university in Dundee would need not merely the support of the citizens of Dundee but also the financial support of the taxpayers of the community as a whole. The days of private enterprise in founding universities, or, for that matter, municipal enterprises, are no longer with us. I am told that Dundee has been promised a very generous private donation of £100,000 for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2336</span>
an independent university if it came along, and Dundee Corporation, both sides of which have supported the recommendation for an independent university, has indicated its willingness to levy a 6d. rate, which would bring in about £42,000 a year. But Lord Cooper points out very powerfully that the capital sum required to run a modern university is of the order of £3 million, and I doubt if the money I have mentioned would go far towards that figure.<br><br>
In these circumstances, the establishment of a university in Dundee becomes a matter of State policy. It has to be faced in Dundee that when one comes to consider this sort of question the normal method of doing it is by means of a Royal Commission. The Royal Commission has sat. We in Dundee were among the people who asked for it to be set up. Those who advocated an independent university have now to face the consequences of the verdict which the Royal Commission has issued.<br><br>
Let us look briefly at the verdict. It seems to me to come down to this, that if a real and equal partnership is created between the academic foundations on both sides of the Tay, that can result in better education both in St. Andrews and in Dundee. Lord Tedder outlines among his recommendations—I hope these recommendations in particular will be fully carried out—proposals for bringing the medical and dental schools in Dundee within the ambit of the new Dundee college to be set up. That means a very great deal of gain for the City of Dundee. I do not think that gain is really fully appreciated. It is worth recollecting that Lord Cooper discussed that proposal and actually came out against it on the grounds that it would give too much power and influence to Dundee. So in this recommendation Dundee can feel that it is getting very full recognition and a chance to stand on grounds of real equality with St. Andrews. Lord Tedder recommends that the reorganisation should bring about in Dundee a modern university dealing primarily with social sciences, with economics, pyschology, geography, history, and so on, and this would bring not only Dundee but the whole of the university into line with the needs of the times.<br><br>
The big question is whether these changes can be carried through successfully. I repeat that the problem is one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2337</span>
of creating a spirit of co-operation and acceptance of the proposals. A great deal depends on the atmosphere that can be created in Dundee to win constructive co-operation in carrying out the recommendations of the Royal Commission. If we are to get that, I suggest to Her Majesty's Government and to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that it will not merely be necessary for justice to be done in relation in Dundee but it will be equally necessary for justice clearly to be seen to be done. For that reason, I intend to suggest—I shall so move during the Committee stage—that we should make an addition to the title of the university and that in future, from the completion of the Bill, the university ought to be known as the University of St. Andrews and Dundee.<br><br>
I do not want this to be thought to be merely a local proposal. I believe it to be essential to fulfil the purposes of the Bill. The Bill is designed to establish a full partnership between the two sides of the Tay. I believe that the proposed title will meet a legitimate civic pride in the City of Dundee, and tell the people of Dundee exactly what the Bill does for them. It will also help to create the atmosphere without which the Bill cannot possibly succeed.<br><br>
I know that the traditionalists will probably feel that a university as old and as historic as this one has been shown to be by the description given by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) ought not to have its title damaged in any way, but I submit that the change that I have suggested merely extends the title and, far from damaging it, actually adds some improvement to it in the sense that we should have formally marked in the title the partnership between the ancient seat of learning and the modern pulsating industrial city. I commend the suggestion to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
It is important to remember that one of the main proposals in the Bill is the wiping out of the existing Board of Governors in Dundee and of the Council which is connected with it. It is very important in carrying this through that an atmosphere of trust and good will should be created in Dundee and that the removal of these bodies should not in any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2338</span>
way be made to appear to be, to return to my military metaphor, an act of unconditional surrender. In this connection it is worth remembering the words of Lord Cooper in his Report. In paragraph 104 he points out that we are asking Dundee:
<br><blockquote><p>"…to place their interests unreservedly in the hands of the University Court whose attitude in the past has been declared by them to be unfriendly. If the principles of our recommendations are accepted as a whole, it is vital from our point of view that all concerned should do everything in their power to remove any suspicion that the term St. Andrews University is synonymous with United College; and this end would be materially assisted if, in the election of Assessors to the Court, Dundee were generously treated, especially during the early years of the new regime."</p></blockquote>
I ask that, in the appointment of assessors both to the court of the university as a whole and to the council of the new Dundee College, every effort should be made to secure the willing co-operation of those in the City of Dundee who have already devoted a great deal of their energy to trying to build up university education in the city.<br><br>
This raises the question of lay representation. I support the point of view which has been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) and the right hon. and gallant Member for Glasgow, Kelvin-grove. I do not think the case has been successfully made out for removing the Lord Rector from the chair of the university. The students in St. Andrews have a long and good record of electing responsible rectors. Their last selection of a man who will occupy the post for another two years, I believe, is a particularly good example of this. On the other hand, the Lord Rectors who have been elected by the students of St. Andrews have, certainly in recent years, an excellent record of attendance to their duties as chairmen of the university court. It is a bad principle that the principal of the university, who is the chairman of the senate, should also sit in the chair of what amounts to the appeal court. I support the general point of view on lay representation put by my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North.<br><br>
I admit there are risks both ways. There are risks with an elected chairman of getting somebody who is not suitable for the post, but history is against that point of view in St. Andrews. There are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2339</span>
risks of leaving the principal in the chair with all the power in his hands, and we have seen some evidence of that, as I have indicated, in the recent post in St. Andrews, but if it comes to that I must say that I much prefer the dangers of democracy to the dangers of dictatorship, and I hope that Her Majesty's Government will feel able to leave the Lord Rector in the chair of the university.<br><br>
It seems to me that the Bill provides an exciting opportunity for Dundee to make academic advances in step with the very great industrial advances which have been made in the city in recent years. If that is to happen, we shall require a spirit of generosity from the St. Andrews side of the "civil war" and we shall need a spirit of trust from the Dundee side of it. I hope that when the new principal is appointed—I am sure he will have the goodwill in his difficult task of all those who have taken part in dealing with the problem—he will make every effort he can not merely to be fair administratively between the two sides of the university—I am sure he will do that—but also to do everything he can to bring Dundee as a community into the life of the university, to make sure that some of the principal ceremonies in connection with university life take place in Dundee and to let Dundee as a city feel that the university is something in which they have a very full and real share.<br><br>
If that can be done, I believe we can achieve something rather unique with the Bill. We shall set up a seat of learning which will be at once the most ancient and also the most modern in Scotland. It will have a foot equally placed on the north side and on the south side of the Tay. I hope that the university will bear the name of the University of St. Andrews and Dundee and that that new title will be a description of a real partnership in place of the old jealousies and resentments.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2340</span>
one of the greatest to all born or brought up in Scotland. It is not inappropriate that I should quote the words of a very distinguished Lord Rector of St. Andrews University, the late Sir J. M. Barrie, when he said that education is the birthright of every man and woman.<br><br>
I rise to support the Bill as a graduate in arts and science in St. Andrews University. If the Royal Commission had recommended that there should be two separate universities, one for Dundee and one for St. Andrews, I should have found myself in great personal difficulty and subject to much personal conflict. I was born in Dundee, and I received my primary education in Dundee. As a result of scholarships founded by Dundee citizens I got my secondary education in Dundee, and, again as a result of scholarships founded by Dundee citizens, I was able to go to St. Andrews University and elsewhere later. Needless to say, my loyalties to Dundee are very great. On the other hand, no one who has spent four years at the United College at St. Andrews can fail to carry through all his life very great affection for that ancient and historic institution. As my right hon. and gallant Friend said, it is the oldest, the most historic and, in my view, of course, the finest university in Scotland.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Being in the nature of a guest in this Committee it would be wrong of me to take up too much time. I do not propose to enter into past controversies. The late principal, Sir James Irvine, was a dear friend of mine but I did not see eye to eye with him on certain controversial matters. On the other hand one of the chief protagonists in Dundee was a gentleman for whom I have the greatest respect and a man who has made a great contribution to the industrial and civic life of the city. I am therefore delighted to hear of the wise recommendations of the Commission.<br><br>
Contrary to some, I have always taken the view that one mistake, as was said by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) was the desire to try to give to St. Andrews and United College more advantages than the Dundee University College. I have always taken the view that our course was to develop Dundee primarily as a medical and dental school, as an economic school, and indeed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2341</span>
as the school of Scottish law; and to leave the arts to St. Andrews.<br><br>
I think we should pay a tribute to the work of Sir James Irvine in making the school of science at St. Andrews one of the finest and most famous in the world. It was started by Purdie who was followed by his own pupil, Irvine, who became the successor to Fischer, the great German sugar chemist. One of the great things which happened during the 1914-18 war was that novocain was able to be made synthetically as a result of the researches of Irvine and his students.<br><br>
There are one or two points which I hope may be dealt with on Committee stage. Clause 1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"… and a college to be known by such name as the Secretary of State may determine and in this Act referred to as 'the College in Dundee.'"</p></blockquote>
I should like to see inserted the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"… as the Secretary of State may with the prior approval of Parliament determine."</p></blockquote>
We ought to have a joint discussion about what name, if any, the Dundee College should have. It is a small point, but not without interest.<br><br>
In subsection (2) of the same Clause it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard shall consist of the head of the College…"</p></blockquote>
I forget the recommendation of the Tedder Committee about the name of the head of the college. I think it was "Provost," or something like that. I do not like that term and would suggest that the head of the colleges, however they are finally grouped, might be called "vice-principal."<br><br>
I agree with everything said about the position of the lord rector as chairman of the university court. I hope the Clause in the Bill dealing with that will be altered to restore the ancient position. There is a purely drafting point in connection with Clause 7 (2). I had to read this Section carefully two or three times, and I consider it might well be re-drafted to make clearer what exactly is intended.<br><br>
I submit it is important that we should get the new set-up going as quickly as possible. Clause 11 states that the Commissioners will continue in force for three years. I consider that it would be better to say, "not exceeding three years." It may well be, indeed I hope it will be,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2342</span>
that they may finish their work of reorganisation and recommendation in a shorter period. After all, time is one of the factors in this matter which is, so to speak, the essence of the contract.<br><br>
I welcome this Bill. This for me is a day of nostalgia. I commenced by quoting Barrie. May I conclude by recalling that he said God gave us roses so that in memory we may have roses in December. To me St. Andrews will always be a fragrant memory. I believe that this scheme will go forward with the good will of both sides, and that my St. Andrews rose of memory will gain greater fragrance and loveliness as a result of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for taking up time but I feel it would be wrong were it to go out to Scotland that we had in any way limited the time allotted to our discussion of what is one of the most important of the Scottish educational institutions.<br><br>
If we have any doubts about this Bill I consider it our duty to express them, and I must confess that, unlike other speakers, I have grave doubts. I was one who started with the pre-supposition that it was highly desirable to keep unity between St. Andrews and Dundee. But the more I have read and listened the less I think that case has been completely made out, although I would not desire at the moment to go to the other extreme.<br><br>
It has been eloquently said by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) that each can give a great deal to the other. St. Andrews has the traditions of an old university and Dundee the driving force of a modern industrial community. But if both are to benefit they must come together. How much interchange is there between St. Andrews and Dundee? I suspect that among the students there has been comparatively little.<br><br>
It may well be important to devise a curriculum to allow students to go for a year or two to St. Andrews and then complete their course in Dundee. I think it a good thing that students should move around the universities in the way they do on the Continent. In that way they would derive benefit from the ancient traditions of St. Andrews and the now spirit of Dundee. To do that they must get together.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1223">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2343</span>
But if we look at other universities we shall see that, for example, merely by joining Reading and Oxford and putting one principal over them we should not necessarily get any intermingling between students from Reading and students from Oxford. Those people who have any experience of Newcastle and Durham will know that there has in fact been great difficulty there at different times.<br><br>
The vital point is to decide how many universities one may have in Scotland and how many students. The Secretary of State has not said a word about that. I believe that the number of students in Scotland is likely to settle down at about 15,000 and that will be a proportion to the population of about double the figure of 200 years ago. I have yet to be convinced that we should be satisfied with that figure. It may well be that the future of this country depends to a great extent on training its brain power, and that we should aim at a much bigger student body in Scotland.<br><br>
Like the right hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove I reject the argument about catchment areas. St. Andrews has never been confined to Auchtermuchty and Strathkinness. It has drawn its students from all over the world and 40 per cent. of them come from outside Scotland. I am told that there is great pressure for accommodation for students from the Commonwealth who cannot be accommodated in the universities of this country. If that is true it is a most relevant factor in the consideration of our future policy.<br><br>
It is said that we cannot afford a fifth university. It may well be that we may have to afford a fifth university. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) produced some very good figures. What will be the cost of setting up the suggested college in Dundee? How much saving will there be? We must bear in mind that the Baxters who made it possible to have a college in Dundee intended it to provide a university education. I was surprised that the Secretary of State for Scotland of a Conservative Government did not even mention that. Yet he proposes to deal rather drastically with the endowments and the public trust under which the college in Dundee was set up.<br><br>
We must bear in mind that the first professors in Dundee were professors of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2344</span>
the arts and were very distinguished. It may be said that a college in Dundee will fulfil all the intentions of the Baxters. It will give an arts education if it follows up the proposals in the Tedder Report. But I very much doubt whether it will give an arts education of university standard. I very much doubt if the sort of "Modern Greats", if I may use the phrase, will flourish. It seems to me that a sort of composite school of philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology and so on depends largely on the mentality of the gentlemen engaged in teaching in other schools. Modern Greats at Oxford flourishes on Greats and I doubt whether the standard in Dundee would be very high.<br><br>
We know the real difficulty is that clinical medicine cannot be taught at St. Andrews. It might be said that we should divide the faculties and have the arts and history, botany and so on at St. Andrews and leave clinical medicine, and perhaps economics, and so on in Dundee. A student might take the arts at St. Andrews and economics at Dundee. I have no time however to consider whether it would be possible to have a university in which there was such a sharp division and whether there would be the interplay between rivals trained in different subjects which is so very important in the life of a university.<br><br>
If the institution was so severed the professors of medicine in Dundee might say they were part of a technical school only, and would prefer to be part of a general university because they felt cut off from their colleagues in other subjects. But a clear severance between faculties would be one possible coherent solution.<br><br>
I strongly suspect that, as it is, the Committee is taking a gamble under this Bill. We may find that St. Andrews in the future will be crying out because the prestige and power of the university has shifted across the Tay. We do not know. I feel that the case against a separate university in Dundee has not been made out, that an open mind should be kept on the subject, and that no obstacle should necessarily be put in the way of its development.<br><br>
12.0 noon.<br><br>
St. Andrews has a very long and honourable history, and it is worth putting on record that it is simply not true to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2345</span>
that the university has been a mere cockpit of controversy during the past 30 years. If we look at the School of Philosophy at St. Andrews we find that Stout, Pringle-Pattison, A. E. Taylor and Jones have all taught in that school; Broad taught in Dundee and Bennett and Lindsay taught classics in this century.<br><br>
Disunity is an occupational disease of universities. It is not entirely inappropriate that the Borgia founded one. I doubt whether even in Florence at the height of the Renaissance one had to be so quick on the draw as in our universities. A certain amount of intrigue, bickering and fun is permitted.<br><br>
A very notable feature of St. Andrews is that not only was it founded on a collegiate system, but that the colleges still exist. A college consists of three things. First, there are the professors, and I think they are highly important. Then there are the students, but I think they gain most of their learning at the university by rubbing their minds against those of first-rate teachers. If there are no first-rate teachers, there is no university. I would like to see the professors paid a great deal more than they are. We have only 20 first-rate professorships of philosophy in this country which are paid only £2,000 each. I would like to see that figure doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the reverse is also true? He says that if we do not get first-rate professors, we do not get first-rate students. Is not the reverse also true?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but not to the same extent.<br><br>
Secondly, there is great advantage in the students living together. The third thing of importance is the buildings and the atmosphere in which they live, and St. Andrews, except for Old Aberdeen, is the only university where the buildings exist. Although St. Leonard's College has been out of existence for 200 years, the rooms are still there and the chapel is still there and has now been restored by the generosity of Sir Baird Russell.<br><br>
At St. Mary's, we have the university library next door to it, the room where the Scots Parliament once met, the science buildings, the botanical gardens and a hostel taken over from St. Leonard's to accommodate the students. I should like
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2346</span>
to see St. Andrews take in more students. Like the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Beresford Craddock), I have a great admiration for the late principal. His policy was the right policy, but I think he made a great mistake in not attaching to the college the buildings in which the students were to live. He built hostels, but they are divorced from college life and have become hotels. The house in which I was born, and in which I think the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Boothy) was also born, is now part of the university. No doubt our spirit broods over it. It ought to do the students good, but I would rather they were in colleges.<br><br>
I should like to see that college life expanded and preserved and more people from the homes of Scotland having the advantage of going there. I do not entirely accept the view that only the clever boys can go to the university. That has never been the doctrine of the richer classes in this country. It has always been the doctrine to mix the clever with the not so clever. A tremendous extension of that principle could come about in St. Andrews.<br><br>
One last word on the reorganisation of the university. I do not want to go into what has been said about the rector, though to some extent I agree with it, nor about the representation of the college court, but one thing that has not been mentioned is the position of the principal. The principal is to be a subordinate member of the college council, but is also to be the chairman of the court. That may be all right, but it appears to me to be an anomaly.<br><br>
Is it desirable to have a principal who is going to give very long continuity? I have paid my tribute to the late Sir James Irvine, a very great man, but, surely, one of the difficulties we are in is due to the fact that he was there so long. There have been similar cases at Oxford and Cambridge. I am not sure that a change every three years would be a bad thing. It may well be found that the university has got rid of King Log as rector and got King Stork in his place.<br><br>
It is a slightly derogatory position that the oldest university in Scotland should be put into the hands of Commissioners. I believe that as far as possible universities should run themselves. The conflict between the senate and the court
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2347</span>
should never arise. The senate is responsible for the curriculum, and if the stage arrives where it is in conflict with the court, then things have come to a pretty pass. If the Commissioners are going to interfere with the curriculum of the university that is bad.<br><br>
I share the hope that this Bill will provide a stepping-off point. I do not think it is a solution, but only a beginning. I can understand the differences between the university and the City of Dundee, and I agree with the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) that the city has cause for a lot of complaint. But, on the whole, both the university and Dundee have accepted this, and, that being so, I do not think it will stand in the way, though I personally have more misgivings about it than have so far been voiced in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain J. A. L. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) began by saying that he had doubts about the wisdom of this Bill. I am glad that he ended by saying that he was not going to vote against it. A lot of what he said dealt with matters that are quite beyond me, because I have never been to a university, and all this technical stuff is something which will have to arise within the working of the university. It is quite beyond the intelligence of those who have not been privileged to go to Oxford or Cambridge, or to any other university. I will, if I may, quote a Latin tag—<i>moriturus to saluto</i>.<br><br>
I am a Governor of University College, Dundee, not because of my personal qualities, but because of the accident of fate which has made me the Member for Angus, South. In a way, this is my swan song as a Governor of University College. I would add, however, that I have deliberately never attended a meeting of the University College Governors because I knew that the controversy would eventually arise in Parliament. I thought it wiser to leave myself free to discuss this Bill, which I knew was coming, without being prejudiced one way or the other and without giving the appearance of having a vested interest in one side or the other.<br><br>
My right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) has given us the history of this university. He told us
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2348</span>
how the University of St. Andrews was started in 1411, and how the colleges were added through the Middle Ages. He told us that it was the oldest university in Scotland, with all its ancient traditions, and described how it has survived and extended its operations through the years, how it has achieved atmosphere, and how, on the other side, we have this modern University College in Dundee which was only started in 1881.<br><br>
I think a tribute is due to the original donors of the £140,000—Miss Baxter and Dr. Baxter—who made it possible to start the university at that time. It was originally intended that there should be university education, but it was never suggested that there should be any connection with St. Andrews. The idea was that there should be external degrees of London University and there was no idea of affiliation with St. Andrews. Then came continuous arguments as to whether it should affiliate or unite with St. Andrews University.<br><br>
Gradually the University College expanded, although I agree with the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) that the rate of expansion has not been what we should like to have seen. The University College appointed its own principal, and there was a principal before the present one. Residences have been established, and we are getting the feeling of a university in Dundee.<br><br>
Then there was the beginning of the university precincts. The buildings have not yet been built, but the sites have been acquired. This has gone on with the continued support of the citizens of Dundee, and I think it fair to say that there is no reason for the students studying in Dundee to feel inferior to those studying at St. Andrews. Nevertheless, the relationship between the university and the college has throughout been an unhappy one.<br><br>
The demand later arose for a separate university in Dundee, and here, I think, a tribute is due to Mr. D. C. Thomson and those associated with him for putting this forward—contrary to everything that has been said against him—fearlessly, courageously and continuously right from the beginning to the present day.<br><br>
We have this conflict of two personalities, the principal for whom the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2349</span>
Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) rightly has great admiration, and this equally tenacious and courageous man in Dundee who, with his friends, put forward the opposite point of view. It is very largely due to him that the Cooper Committee and the Royal Commission under Lord Tedder were set up. It is only right that tribute should be paid where it is due.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The reasons for these continual disputes can be summed up under four heads. First, there is the form of the constitution of University College, where there was concurrent legislation; secondly, the form of the Council of University College, where one could buy a vote for £5 and there was plural voting; thirdly, the clash of personalities between the gentlemen I have already mentioned and, fourthly, the difference between the ancient calm and academic position of St. Andrews and the thrusting, businesslike modern efficiency of the citizens of the modern city of Dundee.<br><br>
This Bill is an attempt, through organisation, to obtain unity. We have the modem constitution; we have the new pyramidical Civil Service structure, with someone at the head, the two colleges balancing each other below, and so on all the way down. It is neat, tidy, streamlined and efficient. It is just like Lord Tedder—an extremely high-powered and efficient Air Force officer. It may be right, but one of the casualties in this efficient streamlining has been the sacrifice of the Lord Rector. I do not want to say very much on this occasion, except to echo the sentiments which have been expressed from all sides of the Committee that the Lord Rector should not be the victim of this streamlining and that we should pay more regard to tradition and less to efficiency in this particular case. I do not think that we shall lose anything in efficiency if we do so.<br><br>
Will this new Bill work? There is some reason to doubt whether it will. St. Andrews is for it, but the Council of University College, at the second vote, decided against it. The Governors, by 43 votes to 11, decided against it, and the Dundee Corporation—both political parties—are against it. It is clear that any solution to this problem must be dealt with very tactfully and gently if we are to achieve unity and goodwill, so that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2350</span>
those who have been so persistently against it will be carried along or, at any rate, not oppose it further.<br><br>
What were the reasons for the opposition? It was not fractious opposition; there was a genuine grievance. As a matter of national policy. a new university was desired. I am not prepared to argue that. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland seemed to think that a new university was desirable, that it would be an advantage to the cultural and industrial life of Dundee; that the University of St. Andrews has failed in their responsibilities to the University College of Dundee, and that an independent university, was practicable, both on educational and financial grounds.<br><br>
All those arguments have been dealt with in the two reports. One is bound to come to the conclusion that in these days, after two Commissions have unanimously reported that those views were not substantiated in modern practice, one must try to make the best of their recommendations. This is not an ideal solution, but I hope that those in Dundee will take advantage of the situation and do their best to support the new constitution when this Bill is passed.<br><br>
Let me very briefly say what I believe to be the advantages. First, the two places are only 15 miles apart. In the Tedder Report there is an extract from the Royal Commission Report of 1876–78, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Now that a bridge over the Firth of Tay has been completed, St. Andrews will be within about half an hour's journey of Dundee; and as the University of that place possesses complete Faculties of Arts and Divinity, and the rudiments of a Faculty of Medicine, various projects have been formed for combining the educational resources of Dundee with those of St. Andrews in such a manner as to minimize the loss of teaching power and of endowment which would attend the co-existence of wholly independent teaching institutions at the two places. It might be suggested that the seat of the University of St. Andrews should be transferred to Dundee; but to this course there are so many objections, both sentimental and practical, that it is probably not worth detailed consideration…"</p></blockquote>
The point is that even in 1878 a Royal Commission had seized on the old Tay Bridge—the one that was blown over in a gale the year after—to recognise a new situation, and if we can only reach a situation during the next year or two when there is a Tay Road Bridge, with all that involves, this idea of separation might become less important.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1227">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2351</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and gallant Member really think that the students will go backwards and forwards over the road bridge? At the moment the students do not travel between the two places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) think that nobody from St. Andrews goes to Dundee, and nobody from Dundee ever goes to St. Andrews, except on some academic errand? The pupils are continually mingling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope they will mingle even more when traffic conditions are more favourable than at the present time.<br><br>
Secondly, the economic and industrial situation of Dundee, linked to the historic and calm background of St. Andrews University, should be a great advantage to that university. Thirdly, the policy of extension in Dundee should be a great advantage to Dundee itself. The Tedder Commission, in Recommendation 28 said that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The teaching of social science in Dundee should be within the Faculty of Arts of the University. It will call for the creation of chairs in Economics, History and Philosophy, in addition to the present chair of Mathematics, and the provision of Honours teaching not only in these subjects but in Geography, Politics and Psychology."</p></blockquote>
That means an extension of the teaching and of the chairs in Dundee, which should be of great benefit to Dundee. I echo what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) said about the medical and dental extension, because that is of the greatest importance at the present time. Dundee seems to be going through a bad time from the point of view of medical teaching.<br><br>
The fourth advantage is that it will inevitably mean increasing Government grants, through the University Grants Committee and, whatever is done, if we are going to get extensions we are bound to have increasing Government grants and they will inevitably have to come to Dundee.<br><br>
The fifth advantage, which is on sentimental grounds, is concerned with the name for the University College which is adumbrated in the Report. If it is a Royal name it should give a flying start to the new constitution. We do not know what the name is, but we hope it will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2352</span>
one which will rally all loyal citizens in Dundee in support of the new constitution.<br><br>
Lastly, the efficiency of the new organisation should promote the interest not only of St. Andrews but of Dundee. Time alone will tell what will happen, but if we can get a spirit of unity among all people connected with this age-long dispute we shall have done something for the future generations of students, not only from this area but from England, South Africa and the Empire—and even from foreign lands. If that is done it will redound to the credit of this generation, who are now legislating not for themselves but for future generations of their kith and kin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Strachey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for more than a very few moments. I want to put it on record that the Parliamentary representation of Dundee is united in this matter, as in all other matters. Like most other Members of the Committee, when I read the Tedder Report I had the impression that whatever were the defects and difficulties of this solution it was something which would inevitably be attempted and obviously needed the greatest available measure of support. It attempted the very difficult task of uniting what are undoubtedly the antithetical traditions of Dundee and St. Andrews, as was very well expressed by the right hon. and gallant Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot).<br><br>
It will not be easy but it is something which must be attempted. The hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) spoke of a judgment of Solomon. When the hon. and gallant Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan) was speaking it crossed my mind that even Solomon would have had his difficulties in dealing with some of the most eminent citizens of Dundee, particularly the one who was mentioned by the hon. and gallant Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Solomon cut the baby in two. This Bill is uniting the baby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strachey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. We are hoping that Lord Tedder has outdone Solomon in this case. It may be, as the hon. and gallant Member said, that the vigorous agitation from Dundee for a separate university has justified itself in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2353</span>
the sense that it has prompted a solution, because the situation could not have been allowed to continue as it was. Therefore, I echo very strongly the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) that there were real grievances and disadvantages about the present situation, and that Dundee's situation was by no means satisfactory or happy. If I may say so with some slight knowledge of the matter, the situation of the University of St. Andrews itself was not wholly satisfactory.<br><br>
Some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) were very much to the point, but I would remind him that the best chance to serve those very interests which he has at heart—the highest kind of university education in Scotland—is to attempt, almost at any cost, to establish one absolutely first-rate seat of learning rather than two less first-rate seats of learning. As I understood the drift of his argument—and I agree with it—there is not much of a case for anything short of the first-rate when we are dealing with universities. Surely it is wise, therefore, to attempt to found one big "refound" —if I may use such a word; one big institution rather than two smaller and probably less satisfactory ones. It is for those reasons that the Bill seems to me, with all its difficulties, to command our support.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
There is one more detailed point that will come up in Committee, though it is not anything I wish to amend. In Clause 7 it is proposed to abolish the Dundee School of Economics. I regret that from a sentimental point of view, because I regard that very small school as a first rate institution which has a very high standard of economic teaching. That is the one subject in which I can claim any pretensions of competence of judgment on an academic subject, and I think that it is a really most remarkable little school. It is being abolished only to be reborn, I hope, as a part of this combined University. It is very largely in that School of Economics, I would say to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), that I see the hope of a first rate school. I agree that the difficulties of making a modern, great school must be formidable. I should like to see it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2354</span>
made round the nucleus of the economic teaching that already exists in Dundee.<br><br>
Finally, I do hope that the Secretary of State and the Government as a whole will take very seriously the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) as to the name of the new university. It is in a sense a new university. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) said that we were attempting to found in effect a new university; we were attempting to incorporate the oldest, the historically most fascinating university in Scotland, St. Andrews, with this 19th century college in Dundee. We are hoping the fusion will make in effect a new institution. Therefore, it is worthy of serious consideration that it should have a new name.<br><br>
The suggestion of my hon. Friend, "the University of St. Andrews and Dundee," is the obvious name. If we can think of a better, let it be so, but, at any rate, the name should incorporate the word " Dundee." It is, of course, a sentimental point, a psychological point; but we are dealing with questions of sentiment and psychology in the feelings of Dundee here, and it may make a real difference to the success of this new institution, to the degree to which the citizens of Dundee will throw themselves behind it and give their enthusiastic support to it, if the word "Dundee" can be incorporated in the title. Therefore, I think the decision to be much more than a verbal point, and I ask the Government really to consider this seriously. It is something about which we in Dundee feel very strongly. Much sentiment in Dundee will have to make sacrifices of cherished opinions to support this Bill, and I think it would help a good deal if the people of Dundee could be met in the way my hon. Friend suggests, and the name of Dundee incorporated in the title of the new institution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thornton-Kemsley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan) I think I ought at the outside to declare an interest, in that in the succession to the former constituency of Montrose Burghs I am one of the Trustees of the University College of Dundee and a Governor of that College. The honour is not one of my seeking, and it is one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2355</span>
which I have done nothing at all to deserve, since, to my regret, I have not found it possible to attend any of the meetings of the Council. Although I am a Governor of University College I do not share the views that are held by a majority of my colleagues on the board. I do not want to see a separate university in Dundee.<br><br>
I can understand why a separate university should be desired. It is said that Dundee as a centre of light and learning is overshadowed by St. Andrews. Nevertheless, it has not inconsiderable facilities for higher education. There is the University College itself; there is the conjoint School of Medicine; there is the School of Dentistry; and, in addition, although they are without formal association with University College, there are the Dundee Training College, the Institute of Art and Technology and the School of Economics to which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) referred.<br><br>
Although it possesses these considerable facilities for higher education Dundee is conscious—and I think it is to its credit that it is conscious—of its lack of a strong centre of culture. Consider St. Andrews and Dundee, so unlike each other, and yet each possessing a strong individuality, and each with its distinctive contribution to make to our Scottish way of life; the one an historic and beautiful city, bearing about it the marks of its antiquity, famed alike as a centre of learning and as the cradle and home of a Royal and Ancient sport, the other a teeming industrial town, virile and boisterous, proud of its past just as St. Andrews is, but lacking the distinction which the university imparts to its sister City of Aberdeen. In spite of this I cannot believe that the case for a fifth Scottish university has been made out on educational grounds. Even if it had, it is very doubtful, to my mind, if it ought to be on the east coast of Scotland, where there are already three universities.<br><br>
There are great, overriding advantages in the continued association of Dundee with St. Andrews. The students are eligible to hold a degree of an ancient and famous university; the professors sit as equals with the professors of the United College and St. Mary's in the Senate, and are able to play a direct part in the con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2356</span>
struction of the teaching syllabus; and University College itself becomes eligible for, and has in fact received, substantial grants from the Treasury, from the Education (Scotland) Fund and from the Carnegie Trust.<br><br>
I should say, however, that there is not anyone now who desires to see the continuance of the status quo. There are many unsatisfactory features in the union of 1897 under which University College has, in a sense, enjoyed the best of two worlds. It has continued to retain a relatively independent status while deriving substantial benefits from affiliation with St. Andrews. It enjoys the membership of an exclusive club while preserving still a large measure of financial independence.<br><br>
In what direction ought the change to be? Like other speakers I would reject the separation of Dundee from St. Andrews. The Council of University College, in the evidence which it prepared for the Royal Commission, propounded a federal solution. A federal constitution gives to each member of the federation a large measure of freedom to develop as it pleases. The difficulties in the present relationship between Dundee and St. Andrews have their root in the anomalous position of University College, and especially in the large measure of independence which it has retained. I agree with the evidence which was prepared for the Royal Commission by the university court. It says in paragraph 50 that to allow this relative independence to continue, and to give it a firmer and more permanent basis in a federal constitution, would, as Lord Cooper states in his paragraph 78, only widen the gap between St. Andrews and Dundee and
<br><blockquote><p>"… would create more friction than it would remove."</p></blockquote>
The Royal Commission decided not in favour of separatism nor in favour of federation, but in an integration of those parts of the university which are in Dundee and those parts which are in St. Andrews, and I believe that the solution propounded by the Royal Commission, a solution which has been embodied, by and large, in the Bill, is not only a wise one but is essential to the working of the university, and that it offers the best hope, perhaps the only hope, of damping down the fires of controversy.<br><br>

In conclusion, I confess I find myself in agreement with much that has been said about the position of the Lord Rector and in particular with the arguments advanced by my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot). The arguments in favour of an Amendment to the Bill will be deployed in Committee. The Amendment is desired not only by the students of the university and by the council of graduates but by the general council of the university, who, on 31st January last unanimously resolved that the rector should be retained as chairman of the university court. With many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, I am in agreement upon that proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call on the next speaker I would remind the Committee that we can continue sitting until 1.15 provided that the Chairman is satisfied that we shall really finish by then. May I have the feeling of the Committee on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This debate has been remarkable in that it has shown on both sides of the Committee complete unanimity with regard to the Bill so far as it attempts to heal an old sore. On that ground everyone who has spoken so far has agreed, even including the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) who almost drew me into other ways which I should very cheerfully have followed had time permitted. I should so much have liked to have taken up one point he made in regard to the fifth university in Scotland, for the simple reason that it touched an old chord, because six years ago I initiated a debate in the House on the Adjournment and put forward a suggestion that the time was now ripe for a fifth university in Scotland. I am sorry to say to my right hon. and hon. Friends from Dundee that I did not regard Dundee as the suitable place for the fifth university. My designated place was the capital of the Highlands, Inverness, gateway to a land of unsurpassed and unsurpassing beauty. I should have liked to see there, a fifth university, unique in that it would be purely residential, something which Scotland has not so far achieved.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2358</span>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
However, we welcome the Bill because it seeks to heal an old sore, but there is the danger, as has been indicated by various hon. Members, that we may reopen other sores. It is to that point, and with regard to one particular aspect, that I wish to confine my remarks. By the Universities (Scotland) Acts of 1858 and 1889, senate control in Scotland was terminated. The Bill restores senate control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Henderson Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary shakes his head, but I shall try to show him that the Bill does restore senate control in Scotland. Senate control will come into operation at the end of five years when the three Crown assessors are withdrawn from the university court and the principal, as the new chairman in place of the rector, exercises his casting vote as chairman.<br><br>
I am not against an increase in senate representation. I want to make that quite clear. In fact, I think there is a need for an increase in senate representation. The University of Glasgow has 350 lecturers who have no representation whatsoever on the university court. Here I may be disagreeing with the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) who would like senate representation reduced. I would rather see it increased so that it might bring into its comprehension the large group of teachers who are at present excluded.<br><br>
I have said that senate control is renewed as an effect of the Bill. In the case of the University Court of St. Andrews the present senate representation is five plus the principal, the general council has four representatives and other representatives number five, making a total of 15. Under the Bill the representation will become eight from the senate plus the principal, with four from the council and five from others, making a total of 18. This clearly shows that there are nine from the senate with nine from other bodies, and, with the casting vote of the principal, that means the return of senate control.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to disabuse my mind on that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2359</span>
point and also the minds of the general councils of St. Andrews, Aberdeen and Glasgow Universities. In the Bill we shall upset the relationship which exists between the university court and the senate. It is important that we should have regard to the functions of the university court. By the Act of 1889 the university court has three principal functions: first, to review any decision of the senate on appeal; secondly, to review any decision of the senate anent the teaching and discipline within the university itself; and, thirdly, to define the nature of a professor's duty on appeal of the senate.<br><br>
It seems clear to me that the university court is meant to be a court of review and appeal, and, if that is the case, and there will be a preponderance of senate representatives on the university court, it is destroying the essential function of the court. It is destroying the primacy of the court. If that is what is really being done in the Bill, we are acting in a way which is completely wrong, because the status of the university court is safeguarded by two Acts of Parliament. What ought to have been done was to repeal those Acts of Parliament and not seek to subvert them by means of the Bill.<br><br>
I more or less entered into an unwritten agreement not to speak for more than 10 minutes, and I confess that I have exceeded my time by a few seconds. However, I hope that on the Committee stage it may be possible to expand the point which I have raised on this most important issue of senate control. It is a democratic issue, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider it in that way. I hope he will realise that it is a position which can be very easily dealt with and cured. In order to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in the relationship between the court and the senate, all he needs to do is to increase the numbers of assessors appointed by the general council from four to six. He thus maintains the existing position; does not weaken the status of the court and in no way impairs the effectiveness of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very interesting discussion. Everyone will regret that it happened that the debate took place on a day when it was not possible or practicable to continue the debate the following day. While we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2360</span>
agreed to finish the debate today, we all understand it to be an unwritten condition that during the Committee stage there will not be any such restriction on our time and that many of the points which hon. Members are very anxious to raise may then be put in greater detail. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm McPherson), who has not been fortunate enough to catch the Chairman's eye, is an hon. Member who has had senate experience, and, therefore, he speaks from quite another angle. On the Committee stage we shall wish to have the views of all hon. Members with their varied experience.<br><br>
My experience was at the beginning of the attempt to solve the dispute. Even before I appointed Lord Cooper to take the matter in hand I did my best to mediate, with no more success than anyone else has had. The personalities involved were very strong, and the antipathetic nature of the controversy made it very difficult to find any real solution. Indeed, the whole problem is one of trying to mix oil and water. The two sections of the university are so different in atmosphere that it is not easy to integrate them into one homogeneous whole.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) made it appear that there was no solution at all to the problem, even through the Bill. I noticed that he did not attempt to suggest any solution or propose any way by which one could be achieved, but left us high and dry with the fight going on. He reminded me of an old minister friend of mine who was called in to settle a matrimonial dispute. The minister argued with the couple for a long time. Finally, he said "There on the carpet a dog and a cat are lying together. They are well known enemies, but they are not fighting." The wife said, "But tie them together." The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland gives me the impression that he feels that by tying together St. Andrews and Dundee we may not be solving the problem in any way at all.<br><br>
However, so far as we can see, the Bill is an attempt to solve the problem. As the Secretary of State said when opening, the real solution to the problem is good will between the people in Dundee and the people in St. Andrews. My hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2361</span>
Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) has put forward a suggestion which has a great deal of merit in it from the point of view of giving Dundee the satisfaction of the prestige and honour of having a university. Dundee is the only city in Scotland which has not a university, and nothing can wipe out that stain except that it should have its name attached to its own university. The solution proposed by my hon. Friend has the merit of combining the honour and tradition of St. Andrews, which every student wants to attach to his certificate, with continuity, which is an important part of general education. I hope that during the Committee stage hon. Members will consider that problem with great sympathy.<br><br>
There is a problem about the principal and the rector which we will discuss in detail later. If we are to get the right person as the principal of the university —I can say from my own experience that it is not easy to find the right principals for universities—he has to have a position of honour and responsibility. That responsibility must not be diminished and he must not be humiliated in any way by being placed in the position of a second fiddle to anybody. Whether that can be done in relation to the rector is a matter for discussion. One of my hon. Friends who is not here today has the novel solution that the rector might take the chair when matters concerning student discipline and appeals are being considered. But these are matters which we can consider when we come to the detailed aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
It is a great loss for the students in Dundee that they do not have the residential education of St. Andrews. I believe that St. Andrews has a charm and a social atmosphere which cannot be supplied by the great factory-style universities of the towns. Like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, I look forward to the time when every child in our community at some period in his life will have an opportunity of even only a short period of residential education.</span></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock the Chairman, pursuant to Standing Order No. 63</i> (<i>Meetings of standing committees</i>), <i>deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These residential organisations should be extended. If possible—and this is a matter for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2362</span>
the new body—there should be a great deal more intermingling and ebb and flow between Dundee and St. Andrews so that students may have the benefit of both worlds. A great part of the value of university residence is derived from living and working together. I have proved that in the work I have done in connection with summer schools. Men live together and work together and the value to be derived from that can never be offset by mere factory efficiency. It is something which cannot be set down in any curriculum.<br><br>
The need for Dundee's civic pride to be satisfied is just. I am sure that the Committee will not pass this Bill except in the desire that Dundee will see in its practical application of its contents some realisation of the hopes they have felt for many years. It would have been a good thing for Dundee to have had a separate university. But there is a limit to the amount of money that it is possible to spend in setting up duplicate institutions.<br><br>
I saw, therefore, that there was little likelihood of running a second university, but I hope that we can get a combination, a double university of St. Andrews and Dundee. I hope that eventually, under the guidance of a wise principal, they will work together to establish a university which will redound to the credit of Scotland and be a source of pride both to Dundee and to St. Andrews.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This debate has fully justified the system, for which both sides of the Committee may take credit, by which we virtually discuss the Second Reading of Scottish Bills. We have had a brisk, well-informed and constructive debate on the framework of this Bill, and I am happy to feel that there is such widespread approval for the broad purpose of the Measure.<br><br>
I note that the bon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) was in some doubt. He asked us to preserve an open mind, by which I think he meant that we should postpone action on the whole matter. There will be few people in the country who take that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that I hope that the Committee will keep an open mind on the future development of Dundee, and that if Dundee extends no obstacle
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2363</span>
should be put in the way. I think that opinion commanded a certain amount of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From his lofty perch in the far north the hon. Member can take pleasure in sitting comfortably on the fence in these matters. But that is not a course which commends itself to practical people who have a responsibility to exercise.<br><br>
I think we may say that, with the exception of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, the Bill has received a unanimous Second Reading. That does not mean there are no points about which hon. Members feel doubts. It is clear that during the Committee stage several important matters will have to be examined in much more detail than has been possible or indeed appropriate at this stage. These points include the question of the rectorship; the constitution of the court; the position of the colleges; the name and composition of the new college: the name of the university and the functions of the Commissioners. Upon all these matters I recognise that hon. Members feel strongly and will want their case properly examined by the Committee.<br><br>
I am sure that on Committee stage the Government will make the fullest facilities available. There will be no question of cramping the proceedings of the Committee into a number of days. I offer the further assurance to hon. Members that between now and the Committee stage the points which have been mentioned this morning will be given the most careful and anxious consideration.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) asked us to have another look at one or two points. That is exactly what we shall do. But, when contemplating Amendments, I would respectfully invite hon. Members to reflect with care upon the Report of the Royal Commission itself, which this Bill tries to implement. It is by universal consent a fair-minded, penetrating and well-balanced Report, the product of prolonged study by gifted and experienced Commissioners.<br><br>
While, of course, no Government is committed to the acceptance of its recommendations, all hon. Members will agree that, having remitted this most
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2364</span>
complex and difficult problem to a Royal Commission, none of us would wish lightly or without the strongest reasons to reject its advice. It is on that principle that the Government have drawn up the Bill. When we consider the nature and one might also say, the gravity of the issues at stake, I do not think that any other practical course was open to us.<br><br>
The Amendments made in another place were without exception designed to bring the Measure more accurately into accord with the intentions of the Commission. The issues are not in doubt, and I do not think that anybody here wishes to belittle them. There is disunity in this ancient and famous university between its parts in Dundee and in St. Andrews. There is disunity over administration in Dundee and in St. Andrews. This disunity has been in existence for half a century and has gone deep into the marrow of the whole organisation.<br><br>
I have had a close and continuous association with the university for over 20 years, and have known intimately its leading personalities, its professors, its supporters and its critics, and have enjoyed friendship with them on both sides of the Tay. I have seen and studied at close quarters the steady deterioration of the relationships between its various parts, and have watched with increasing anxiety the loss of public and academic esteem that has followed.<br><br>
I am sure that there is no friend of St. Andrews University who does not want to see the end of this unhappy condition, and, with the possible exception of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, I do not think there is an hon. Member in this Committee who does not realise that only by a new organisation which is unambiguous, clear-cut and firm, and which brings about a real and lasting unity, can peace and prosperity be attained.<br><br>
It is with that objective that we are concerned. I listened with great sympathy to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) and to the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey). It was perfectly natural and proper for the hon. Members to voice the injured feelings of that proud city which I know so well. But let us not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1234">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2365</span>
dwell longer upon the past; let us rather look forward.<br><br>
We are now entering upon what we believe will be a new period of justice, harmony and progress in which Dundee will share to the full, and to which Dundee will bring its own peculiar contribution of vigour, drive and generosity which will be of immense value to the whole university.<br><br>
I listened to and was moved by the references of my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvin-grove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) to the traditions of St. Andrews. They are indeed very wonderful traditions of learning, wisdom, pageantry and democracy in learning. As the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Beresford Craddock) said, one cannot walk through the old streets of St. Andrews and past its old stone houses, its ruined cathedral and its university buildings without being moved by the centuries of history that speak from every stone. But St. Andrews too must move with the times. It is no more able today to sustain a university on its own than is Dundee. As my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Kelvingrove said so well, as Dundee needs St. Andrews so St. Andrews needs Dundee—to preserve and expand the heritage that is jointly theirs. Though St. Andrews may very well feel regret at the passing of old customs and long-established forms, I do not doubt that in the interests of the reputation and the advancement of the university it will play a full and honourable part in the new arrangement.<br><br>
If that be so, I hope that hon. Members, in contemplating their Amendments to the text of the Bill, will aim not at upsetting but at strengthening the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2366</span>
carefully and delicately poised structure which the Royal Commission have offered for the guidance of Parliament. If I may use the friendly metaphor of the hon. Member for Dundee, East, this is, in a sense, a peace treaty. As he knows from his military background, however, once a peace treaty has been drawn up it is seldom wise to interfere with its individual terms, especially when, as in this case, the terms include detailed provisions not only for the government of the university, but—much more important—for an enlightened distribution of studies in the two sites of the university.<br><br>
Chapter V of the Tedder Report sets out what is intended, and I commend it to the attention of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. It will be the purpose of the Commissioners to introduce ordinances to carry into effect those academic recommendations. That is their function, as it has been in other Scottish universities of days gone by.<br><br>
In the end, everything depends on the spirit in which this proposal is accepted. The hon. Member for Dundee, East talked about the spirit of acceptance and the spirit of trust that was needed. Given that on both sides—and I believe we shall have it—there is, as he said, an exciting opportunity offered to both Dundee and St. Andrews to restore, revive and expand the oldest and, in my belief, the greatest of the Scottish universities.</span></p>
