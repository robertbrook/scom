PUBLIC EDUCATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that
<ul>
<li>Class III, Vote 17, Approved Schools, Scotland,</li>
<li>Class IV, Vote 13, Public Education, Scotland,</li></ul>
have been considered by the Committee.—[<i>Mr. J. Stuart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are today many problems facing all who are interested in education, but I think everyone would agree that two of the greatest problems—indeed, problems from which some of the other problems arise—are the shortage of teachers and the inadequacy of school building. I propose this morning to devote the greater part of my short speech to the first problem, the shortage of teachers, and if tomorrow I am fortunate enough to catch Mr. Speaker's eye, I hope to deal with the problem of the inadequacy of school buildings.<br><br>
Last year I dealt with the second problem in this Committee and I am afraid the Joint Under-Secretary of State at that time did not appreciate the real seriousness of the problem of the inadequacy of school building. We have had published by the Department a number of papers all giving us very useful information, and the Report of the Scottish Education Department on Education in Scotland in 1952 is a very good Report. I should like to congratulate the Department on the very full part they have devoted to technical education in Scotland, pointing out the good aspects and also the weaknesses that must be rectified.<br><br>
Command Paper 8721 deals with the supply of teachers and the main conclusions are repeated in Command Paper 8813, published by the Scottish Education Department. We find quite a number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2652</span>
points on the supply of teachers which must be causing the Ministers, the Department and all interested in education, serious concern. We learn that 34,000 certificated teachers are in Scotland at present and that by 1957 that number is expected to have risen to 36,000. We also learn that in October, 1951—there is not any later date given even in the Command Paper—there was a shortage of 2,300 teachers and that this shortage, by 1957, will have increased by another 1,000 to 3,300. In 1957 there will be not only a grave shortage in science and mathematic teachers, but also a shortage of primary teachers.<br><br>
We are told that the normal recruitment and the output from the emergency scheme, plus the output from the special recruitment scheme, between now and 1957 will more than overcome the normal wastage in the teaching profession. But, after 1957—when we can expect very few, if any, from the emergency scheme and very likely a decrease in the number from the special recruitment scheme—unless normal recruitment increases, we shall not be attracting to this profession even sufficient people to overcome normal wastage. The conclusions show very clearly that the shortage of teachers at present is serious and is likely to become most serious. Having been for a short time at the Scottish Office, I am only too well aware, as I am sure the Ministers and the Department are aware, that this problem is not easy of solution. Much thought has been given to it for many years but the final solution has not been reached.<br><br>
The results of the special recruitment scheme have far exceeded any hopes I had for it, and I am delighted that that is the case. I learn from this Report that there have been 2,455 applications, that 1,165 have been accepted and that 477 have been rejected. I wonder if, when the Minister replies, he will be able to tell us how many more of the almost 2,500 who applied have been accepted since the publication of this Report.<br><br>
I asked a Question some time ago of the Joint Under-Secretary and learned that at that time, of those accepted almost 75 per cent. would ultimately be graduate teachers in the profession. It is very good news that we are attracting not only in the special recruitment scheme students who will become non-graduate teachers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2653</span>
but that about 75 per cent. of them will become graduate teachers. I should like to know, if possible today, whether, in respect of those who have been accepted since the publication of the Report, the figure is as high as 75 per cent.<br><br>
I feel that this morning we could not overstress the fact that there is no taint of dilution whatever in this special recruitment scheme. I do so particularly because I was amazed when I read a report of a speech made by the President of the Educational Institute of Scotland at the annual general meeting in Edinburgh. He seemed to be deriding us for going out into what he called the highways and byways to get recruits under this scheme. I should have thought that the President of the Educational Institute of Scotland and, indeed, every teacher in Scotland would be delighted to learn that we were attracting into this profession, with no dilution whatever, men and women of ability, and who have real experience outside the teaching profession.<br><br>
I also learn from the Report that the Minister and the Department of Education are giving careful consideration to measures to be taken to improve the situation of the supply of teachers. Again I stress the difficulty and say that we realise all the problems with which the Ministers and the Department must be faced at present. But, so far as I am aware, the present Government have made only one suggestion for increasing the number of teachers and that seems a most retrograde suggestion. They have published a draft Statutory Instrument and with it they have sent to all those concerned—local education authorities and so on—circular No. 269.<br><br>
In that circular and in the draft Statutory Instrument it is suggested that for those girls and young women entering training colleges the qualifications will be lower. The qualifications at present, I insist, are not high for that type of student. At present they must sit five subjects in the examination—two on the higher standard and three on the lower standard. Of the two of higher standard one must be English.<br><br>
Another point we have to remember is that we do not ask those girls to take those five subjects in one sitting. If they collect those five subjects in two sittings at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2654</span>
present they have the requisite qualification to enter a training college. The new proposal is that, instead of having a pass in those five subjects, they may be allowed to enter with a pass in four subjects. Those passes in four subjects may be three lowers and one higher, and the one higher need not be English. That seems a very serious form of dilution, particularly when we remember that the girls are allowed two sittings to collect those passes in five subjects.<br><br>
It is suggested in the circular that only those who have just failed to pass in the fifth subject will be considered. Their mark will possibly be given the committee, who will give them a personal interview and the decision will be made on the personal interview. But at present the Department very carefully examine every marginal case. If a pupil has failed to receive the requisite pass now in any subject, when the oral examination takes place in the school Her Majesty's inspector pays particular attention to that girl in that subject.<br><br>
Not only that, but the inspector takes account of the estimate mark that the school has given the girl in that subject and, in addition, the inspector may ask to see the previous written examination papers and the written work of that girl. After going through all that careful procedure, the Department decides that the girl is not fit to pass in that subject, but that is the girl who is to be given a chance to enter a training college. It seems completely wrong that this suggestion should be made by the Department.<br><br>
It is true that a girl would not be teaching primary children anything like the standard of the subjects in which she is expected to pass in the higher leaving certification examination, but the fact that after two sittings and after careful scrutiny by the Department she could not obtain a pass in English seems to make her not a fit person, academically, to have the important charge of educating our children in primary schools.<br><br>
I have read the Report very carefully, and I find on various pages of it correct criticism of the work that is being done by our pupils in junior and senior secondary schools, particularly in junior secondary schools. Sometimes the suggestion is made that the poor quality of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2655</span>
the work in the junior secondary school is due to faulty teaching in the primary school. If that is the case at present, how much more will it be the case if we try to attract to this profession women who could not get a pass in higher English at the leaving certificate stage?<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I beg the Secretary of State to withdraw this circular and to decide that he will go no further with the draft regulation. I should like to ask him whether he had consultation with the Educational Institute of Scotland on the matter. Had he consultation with those bodies that are responsible for the training of teachers? In the wildest flight of my imagination I could not expect either of those bodies to have given any approval whatever to the suggestions that have been made.<br><br>
We find that in 1956 we could expect to have the first recruits from this scheme. The bulge that we talk about in the school population will have reached the nine-years stage by 1956. By 1959 these pupils will have gone into the secondary schools and the bulge will be there. Therefore, it seems that we are giving up a great deal and that we shall get very little for it.<br><br>
There is another point which I wish to bring to the notice of the Secretary of State. I am not at all sure that by lowering the standard of the primary school teacher we shall get the over-all increase in teachers which we wish. At present we are trying to attract to the profession more and more people with first class and second class degrees. In almost every other profession the a qualifications asked for and the time of training have been increased in recent years. We are now suggesting the dilution of the teaching profession. It seems to me that the people we need, in science and mathematics especially, will be much less inclined to enter the profession than they are even at present.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State is giving further consideration to the matter I should like him to take into account the important point that this may keep from the profession men and women of the very highest qualifications who would not want to enter a profession where we are debasing the qualifications of entry while in other professions the qualifications are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2656</span>
being raised. I do not want to make all that criticism without putting forward some constructive suggestions. It has been suggested by the Committee which dealt with the supply of teachers that teacher shortage is possibly part of a more general shortage of well educated men and women. I think that that is true. It is something which we must face.<br><br>
We find that each year our schools produce 4,000 boys and girls who have qualifications that would allow them to enter either a training college or a university. That 4,000 is not nearly sufficient to meet all the needs of all the professions today. If we hope to advance not only in scholastic matters but in industry, that number will have to be increased considerably. When reading the Report, I was perturbed, although not at all surprised, to see the number of pupils who leave senior secondary schools before completing a fifth-year course. In 1952 of those who had the qualification at 11 plus to enter a senior secondary school, 4,738 boys and 5,827 girls left their senior secondary schools at the school leaving age of 15 years, and 4,656 boys and 5,718 girls left after they had completed three years.<br><br>
That is a very serious wastage. If we could tackle the problem at that part of the senior secondary school, then there would be no need for us to have this dilution which is suggested. If we could tackle it there then finally that 4,000 that we are getting yearly would be a number which we could increase considerably. Again I realise all the very great difficulties that are attached to this problem. Many boys and girls are influenced by the boys and girls who are around them. It is much more easy today to earn a fair wage at the age of 15 than it was previously. that is an attraction, but I would suggest that much more could be done in the schools —I know it from my own knowledge—to encourage boys and girls to remain at school until they obtain their school leaving certificate.<br><br>
Also, much more could be done by parents. If we could have greater cooperation between parents and teachers this 4,000 could be raised considerably. Too little is done to encourage boys and girls, to show them all the benefits that come from a more advanced education, and indeed to show them the responsibilities that the nation might want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2657</span>
place on them and that we should expect them to accept. If we could appeal in that fine way to many of these boys and girls we could increase the number.<br><br>
We see posters all over the country telling boys how fine a career is provided by the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Have we used similar posters to tell young boys and girls how fine a career teaching is? Teaching is a fine career which can give the greatest satisfaction to men and women who are suited to it. I would suggest that something along those lines could be done.<br><br>
I know that one of the Joint Under-Secretaries made a short broadcast publicising more fully our special recruitment scheme. Further broadcasts should be made not only about our special recruitment scheme. There should be broadcasts to parents showing them all the possibilities of teaching as a career. We should also tell the parents of the help that bursaries can give to them for their children. These considerations are important. I am surprised time and again to discover that many parents have little or no knowledge of the help that bursaries can give.<br><br>
Television is one of the most important mediums. Why not have a television programme to help in this recruitment scheme? I would go even further. I feel that since the matter is so serious we ought to have meetings of parents and pupils in village halls, in miners' welfare institutes and in towns showing what can be done. At these meetings, as there are a great many Joint Under-Secretaries, we might have a speech from a Joint Under-Secretary detailing the position. We might have members of the Inspectorate and teachers to describe the great benefits that can be secured.<br><br>
If we can tackle the matter in that way, —even though the methods may be unorthodox—we might see some hope of overcoming the serious shortage of teachers.<br><br>
On page 30 of the Report there is the statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is also important to develop the potentialities of those pupils who are qualified to enter a senior secondary school but whose parents send them to a junior secondary school."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2658</span>
That seems to me a most serious indictment. It seems wrong that any child who is fit for a senior secondary school should enter a junior secondary school. If we had comprehensive schools we should not find this statement in the Report, although on the next page we find something about comprehensive schools which shows that in some instances they are not at all satisfactory points which one of my hon. Friends will deal with.<br><br>
I should like to know what advance has been made in the provision of comprehensive schools? What further plans have been brought to the Department by the local education authorities. If we had comprehensive schools there would be the possibility of giving every child who is able to benefit from this type of education a chance to do so.<br><br>
The problem that I have dealt with is a serious one. Education is of the greatest importance not only for our children but for the future of our nation. We want the help of everyone who is interested. If we can find the methods to get that help then I am certain that the position will not be nearly so black in future and that education of which we have been so justly proud in Scotland will be education of which we shall be able to continue to be proud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. James Stuart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) for the many constructive suggestions which she has made. I assure her that they will be carefully examined. I hope that my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary will be in a position to answer a number of the questions she asked. I suggest that apart from dealing with certain points which she has mentioned, it would perhaps be better for me to deal briefly with some of the general objectives we have in mind and with the work that has been done in the past year or so.<br><br>
The hon. Lady rightly referred to the main problems as being the shortage of teachers and what she described as the inadequacy of school buildings. I agree with her that those are two of the most important matters which we have to deal with in the field of education. It is not for me to influence the Chair but I hope that the hon. Lady will be successful in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2659</span>
her desire to catch Mr. Speaker's eye tomorrow to deal with the second topic which she stressed this morning.<br><br>
There are several points with which I will deal briefly. The first is the topic dealt with in Chapter 1 of the Report—primary and secondary education. As the hon. Lady said, there is the consideration of the high post-war birth-rate which has made the problem more difficult than ever. That is coupled with the fact that naturally during the war there was a hold-up in the normal building programme. I admit that existing accommodation is very heavily taxed and that many classes are too large, but I would add that nevertheless progress is being made to recover from the after-effects of the war and that no child today is receiving less than full-time education.<br><br>
We must give credit to the teachers who have striven with such success to surmount these difficulties, especially in the industrial areas and the cities, where the overcrowding problem is particularly severe. I pay tribute also to the teachers in the country districts. After all, they account for half of our primary schools.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
There are two matters of importance worthy of attention by all interested in educational problems. The first concerns our approach to academic matters in the education of our secondary pupils. A predecessor of mine asked once: "Should there not be more experiment, especially in the junior secondary schools, aimed at enlisting the interest of pupils more fully?"—that is to say, making their secondary education more complete. The second point is whether too many of our boys and girls leave school with their courses uncompleted, although they have the ability to go on and complete them. In this connection we should ensure that the education provided is suited to the needs of the pupil.<br><br>
There is the point which the hon. Lady also mentioned that, apart from the scholastic side there is the economic side, the attraction of earning a wage in the industrial sphere at an early age instead of remaining at school. I would point out that we have considerably increased bursaries recently under the new draft Bursary Regulations published in April. Admittedly it was not possible to pay, in bursaries, something equivalent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2660</span>
to an industrial wage. Nevertheless, I hope that this will provide an incentive to the good type of student to stay on at school and complete the course. I also agree strongly, in theory, with the hon. Lady that much can be done by co-operation between the schools and the homes, teachers and parents working together along these lines and impressing upon suitable children the advantage of staying on.<br><br>
On previous occasions I have referred to the importance of technical education. It is of vital importance in the present world to push on with this matter. We have not kept up with certain other countries in the development of technical education but we are now pushing ahead as fast as we can in the present conditions, and big extensions are being carried out both at the Royal- Technical College and at Heriot-Watt College Central institutions are continuing to do their best to meet the increasing demands while educational authorities are also expanding their facilities for technical education. We must endeavour to catch up, and do everything we can to push on.<br><br>
In February we had the Second Report of the Committee on the Supply of Teachers. The hon. Lady paid particular attention to this matter. I realise that she knows a good deal about the subject while I realise also its importance. The hon. Lady gave figures in some detail. In October we were 2,300 teachers short, and actually, she said, there would be by 1957 nearly 36,00C certificated teachers compared with 34,000 in 1951. The demand would have grown to such an extent that the deficiency in 1957 would be about 3,300. In fact, we have 16 per cent. more teachers than we had in 1939, compared with only 3 per cent. more pupils.<br><br>
Apart altogether from emergencies and special recruiting schemes, we have been getting more normal recruits to teaching for some years past than was the case immediately before the war. The trouble is, not that the ratio of teachers to pupils is falling or that the supply is drying up, but that if we are to have smaller classes and other improvements we need more teachers. On that point we are in agreement.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State has discussed this problem with bodies representing education authorities, teachers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2661</span>
and training colleges and in the Department we have, and he has, examined suggestions in writing from the associations of head masters and head mistresses and directors of education. I would answer the hon. Lady's point about consultations before Circular 269 was published by saying that consultations took place with the Educational Institute as well as with the other bodies. I admit frankly that the Educational Institute were opposed throughout to the proposals as advocated in the Circular.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What was the attitude of the Association of Headmasters .of Senior Secondary schools and the Association of Headmasters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could answer that point in detail. I would rather he did so, because he has been in closer touch with these negotiations.<br><br>
In May, as the hon. Lady said, the Under-Secretary broadcast an appeal for teachers. I am glad to say that, as a result, the number of applications for training under the special recruitment scheme, for which the hon. Lady opposite deserves full credit as having initiated it, rose to 250.<br><br>
To help overcome this shortage of primary teachers we consider that the conditions of entry should be altered slightly. The hon. Lady has dealt very fully with this matter and I quite understand that she feels very strongly on this subject. The effect of the draft amending Regulations is that a student, as the hon. Lady said—I should stress that it is a student who has narrowly failed to pass in one of the five certificate subjects —will be admitted if, after an interview, the training authority is satisfied that her personality is such as to make her likely to be a good teacher. She will have to go through the same training and to attain the same standards as at present. Though I know that the Educational Institute are opposed to the proposal, it was widely supported in the consultations which my hon. Friend had, and I would rather that he dealt with this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not be very clear to the average person reading this statement what distinction is now being made by the circular in the procedure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2662</span>
outlined by my hon. Friend. The Department have a perfect right of careful consideration of these marginal cases. The idea of introducing a circular which puts this procedure into some new form suggests that there is to be further relaxation in addition to the relaxation already permissible under the present scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will consider all the representations made to us, and if amendments are necessary I shall be very glad to consider them. I would prefer that my hon. Friend dealt with these particular points later, if that is agreeable to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman again. The point about which everybody has difficulty is that, at present, as my hon. Friend said, it is possible for the Department to do all that the circular purports to do. If the circular is now putting into concrete form a proposal, it seems to suggest that there is going to be something different from the relaxation which at present is quite permissible to the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the right hon. Gentleman is that the inspector addresses himself to the point whether a good pupil did himself or herself justice in the leaving certificate examination in which he or she has failed. Personality tests applied by the training colleges will be designed to ascertain whether, although a person could not pass in one of the subjects, he or she has qualities of character that would make him or her a good teacher.<br><br>
The most serious shortage of teachers is in science and mathematics. It is not easy to find a solution to this part of the problem, which affects universities and industry as well as the schools. I hope to set up a committee representative of the interests concerned to advise me on this point.<br><br>
Two other points of major importance I should refer to. The first is school meals. This matter has raised some criticism and controversy. The Government decided, as from 1st March, to raise the cost of the school meals by 2d. The new charge of 9d. barely covers the cost of the food and pays no attention to the cost of service and cooking. It is, therefore, not a hard bargain.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2663</span>
It is not a novel change. This has been done before on two occasions by the previous Government. There was a penny put on in each case, and I admit that in this case it is 2d. In 1950 and 1951 the figures fell, but later they began to rise. This has happened once again. There has been a fall in the numbers of 14·7, comparing June with February. I trust that as on previous occasions these figures will begin to pick up. To some extent the June drop was partly seasonal. The matter will be watched. I should add that arrangements are now working for remissions, as well as for free meals, in all areas where any family is unable to pay the cost of the meals. We shall consult local authority associations forthwith to see that these new schemes are working satisfactorily.<br><br>
School building is one of the most important subjects. The Committee are aware of the Report of the Select Committee on Estimates. The problem exists and it is no new one to the Government. We have been aware of it all along. Indeed, some hon. Members may have noticed an open letter from the National Union of Teachers, published, I believe, yesterday. I saw a report of it in "The Times" this morning. Hon. Members may be disappointed to learn that all past Governments are blamed equally in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the impression which the letter gives to me. This is not the solution to the problem. We must push on and do our best. We realise perfectly the importance of co-ordinating school building with the building of new houses. I wish to help the local authorities, whose primary responsibility this is. My right hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary, who will be speaking shortly, and I myself will do everything that we can to help in this direction.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
We set up recently in the Department a development group studying the problem of planning and construction to advise education authorities. We also recently sent to the education authorities a circular dealing with the procedure in connection with school buildings. This circular, among other things, draws attention to the need of co-ordinating school
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2664</span>
and house building, and proposes a net cost for primary schools, as devised by the Select Committee. It also asks education authorities to consult with experienced teachers in the planning of new schools. I hope thus to get the best possible value for the money spent, and I believe this is a wise suggestion which should be carried out.<br><br>
I must assure the Committee that there is no complacency on the part of Ministers on this subject. We know that there are many difficulties. My hon. Friend 'the Under-Secretary is giving constant attention to this problem, and I am grateful to him for all the work he is doing in this field. What is being done is not negligible. The actual size of classes—I admit that many are too large—is going down. The value of the work done in the past year amounted to £6½ million, and the value of the school buildings now in progress amounts to £14¾ million, which is higher than in any previous year. So I submit to the Committee that we are not ignorant of the problems confronting us in the educational sphere, and we are doing our best in the prevailing circumstances to consider and surmount them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far we have mentioned what, I think, will be the two major items of debate—first, the shortage of teachers, and, secondly, the inadequacy of school building. I think that it is worth while pointing out that the shortage of teachers which faces us now is something which dates almost from the last great industrial slump in the early 30's.<br><br>
In those days there was no shortage, because industry could not absorb the graduates who were coming from the universities, and as most of them were qualified to teach either science or mathematics there were plenty of science teachers and plenty of teachers of mathematics who could not find jobs particularly in engineering at that time. I am not going to say that was due to the failure of the system which most hon. Members opposite me this morning believe in. I am not going to say that, but we all know it is the fact. They could not absorb the labour because there was no policy of full-employment, and so we had plenty of teachers.<br><br>
What happened at that time when the supply of teachers was inadequate?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2665</span>
Their salaries were attacked, and in Glasgow they were reduced by 13¾ per cent.—3¾ per cent. more than had been inflicted by the Government. So it is little wonder that teachers are a bit nervy when they hear proposals such as those which are now before us for increasing the supply of teachers.<br><br>
The method which is being adopted is that of lowering the standard of may. Many teachers and most of the teachers organisations today believe that the standard of entry to the profession is still too low. We want to see a graduate profession. We want to see teachers holding either a university degree or the equivalent of a university degree. The dentists have been seeking to raise the status of entry to their profession. No one would suggest for a moment that the entry into the medical profession should be lowered. No one would suggest it for any other profession than the teaching profession, because in the Regulations to which my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) referred—and I endorse all she said about them—which are being introduced, we are adopting a dodge which has been familiar to teachers all the years of my teaching life.<br><br>
We are seeking to divide the profession, for the Under-Secretary said to me last Tuesday in the House that this Regulation was going to apply principally to women. That is nothing new in the teaching profession—divide the profession and get the men into the frame of mind of saying, "This does not matter so far as we are concerned. It is only the women that are being attacked, and so we adopt the noble motto 'women and children first'." That is roughly the educational programme of the party opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a very important point which applies not only to women in the primary schools but to teachers in certain technical schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was to be my next point. As the Under-Secretary will remember, I put that to him in the House last Tuesday. We are dividing the profession, just as has been done before, because when there was the threat of serious action by teachers due to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2666</span>
13¾ per cent. cut to which I have referred, what did the Minister do? He came to the men teachers and said, "Don't worry; we will return you the £50 which has been cut off; you will get £50 back." And so the men were happy and the women were left to fight alone.<br><br>
That is an understandable position, although I am sorry to say it. It raises a lot of old sores in the teaching profession, with which I am not going to deal. A great many men pointed out at meetings which were held all over the country that, if we were not going to stand by the women and if we were going to disunite the profession, then the attack which was now being made on the women would be made throughout the whole profession. Those words became true before the last world war had broken out. So I oppose the lowering of the standard of entry.<br><br>
I put this very point, on which my hon. Friend interrupted me, to the Under-Secretary last Tuesday. I hope that he can answer it today. I asked him to name the type of specialised teachers who would be affected by the operation of this particular Regulation. I hope he has that information. I am perfectly certain that I can forecast the answer that he will give, but I will not take the bread and butter out of his mouth. I realise that many of my hon. Friends will be wanting to say a word or two and, therefore, I shall try to restrain myself and keep to certain points.<br><br>
As I say, we are against the lowering of the standard of entry to the profession. Could the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary of State give us a guarantee this morning that this step, if it materialises, is the only step that will be taken? The road to another place is very slippery, and if we start tampering with the qualifications of entry, and say, "Now we only need four passes instead of five," will the Secretary of State guarantee that we are going to stop at that point? If the lowering from five to four does not achieve the result expected, and does not fill the depleted and depleting ranks of the teaching profession, is he going to carry on with that policy and try to reduce the qualification for entry a little lower still?<br><br>
If he does, as he well may, then we are going back to the state which the teaching profession in England once
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2667</span>
reached—that all that one needed to qualify for teaching was to be vaccinated. over 17 and of good character. No one attacked that system more than the Scottish people. Is that where we are going to be carried today? We have to be careful. My hon. Friend, when she was speaking, said that we were up against various difficulties. She said that boys and girls were leaving school at 15; we were losing them too early. I agree. She said that there was competition from other professions. Again, I agree. I am not going to elaborate these points. But there is another reason, in my estimation, why it is difficult to get people into the teaching profession.<br><br>
How many right hon. and hon. Members of this Committee would like to teach in some of the educational slums of great cities like Glasgow? How many would like to teach in those places and try to carry on the work of education? I remember the story of a friend of mine who went up for promotion. He was asked what had he to say for himself that would further his claim. He replied, "The only thing I can say is that I have been teaching in Milton School in the Cowcaddens for 20 years and I am still sane." He was not promoted. Do many schools in Glasgow and other places provide an incentive for men and women to go into them? They do not. They provide at least a contributory reason for people staying out of them altogether
11.30 p.m.<br><br>
I noticed that the Scottish Education Department in its submission to the Select Committee on Estimates said that in Scotland there are 36 schools ripe for destruction, 12 of them in the industrial areas. I wonder who in the Scottish Education Department wrote that? Does the Secretary of State assume responsibility for that statement which makes no contact with the truth at any point? In the City of Glasgow there are at least 50 schools which ought to be reconstructed now. That is why I interrupted the right hon. Gentleman and said that the letter from the National Union of Teachers which he quoted was not true. That problem did not start in 1945 when the Labour Government came into power.<br><br>
Does the Secretary of State know that in my division in Glasgow alone there are seven schools which ought to be demolished now? I can take a little area,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2668</span>
including that of the hon. Lady the Member for Glasgow, Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen), and give 12 schools in that part of the city alone which are ripe for destruction. Some of them are no more than egg boxes. I have stood in a classroom to which there is no direct entry, separated on each side from the surrounding classrooms only by a thin glass partition and a thin piece of wood—just like a partitioned box.<br><br>
That is where we are carrying on the noble work of education today. I often wonder if we regard education as being of major importance. Frankly, when I see some of these schools, I doubt it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cullen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about staff rooms?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Staff rooms are sometimes not so bad. The lack of necessary conveniences is worse. Some of these schools were condemned 50 years ago and that does not involve the Labour Government. In my division we have such places as Centre Street, Rutland Crescent, Crookston Street, Shields Road, Kinning Park—places that ought not to be housing children today. If we wished to educate them, if we believed that the nation marches forward on the feet of those little children, those feet would not be marching into such places today. Centre Street was condemned 50 years ago, so was Shields Road, while St. Anthony's at Govan Cross is so congested that the headmaster has to stagger the play hours because all the children cannot go into that miserable little playground at the same time. Yet it is a three-year junior secondary school.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned one or two of her schools—St. John's in Portugal Street. Has anything ever been seen like it? There is a school on Clydeside whose existence is unknown to thousands of citizens of the city of Glasgow. It is St. Andrew's school, placed in a narrow lane near St. Andrew's Cathedral, fronting the back—if I may use an Irishism—of the Metropole Theatre. I passed that place for years before realising that there was a school in it. These are horrid places. We are carrying on in them the work of education and we wonder why men and women do not come into the profession to teach in rooms, badly lit, ill-ventilated and, in many cases, lacking in ordinary civilised facilities, not merely for the pupils but for the teachers also. Is it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2669</span>
any wonder that there is a shortage of teachers?<br><br>
I believe that the position could be helped in a positive way, not by demeaning the profession, but by seeking to raise its status by bringing the salaries more into keeping with those of other professions at the same academic level. I still say that until we can red up the mess in the schools of Scotland today, we shall not get men and women to come into teaching. Certainly the problem will be made infinitely worse if the Government seek, as they are now doing, to tamper with the professional standing of the teaching community.<br><br>
I should have liked to refer to some of the recommendations of that most valuable Report of the Select Committee, had time permitted. It is the most profound condemnation of the state of affairs in relation to the school building programme that has been penned during my lifetime. All thanks to the Members of Parliament who unanimously accepted and endorsed what was said in that Report. If we really believe in the function and value of education we shall show a new approach in seeking to apply its recommendations.<br><br>
If that Report was endorsed unanimously, then this Committee, speaking for Scotland should be unanimous in its attitude to the solution. If we take that as our jumping off point in this matter, I am certain that there is still vision and courage in Scotland to solve this problem. It can be solved. In many ways we have done even greater things than this problem presents. I wonder how many people realise what the great Loch Katrine water scheme meant in vision and courage? It was one of the great pioneering achievements of the last century. When it was needed, men and women of courage and vision were there. The call is as clear today. I am certain, therefore, that if we in this Committee can go forward in a spirit of unity and determination, the men and women are there in Scotland to solve this gross problem of educational neglect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Tradeston (Mr. Rankin) is rightly concerned about the report on school buildings which has been laid before us by the Committee on Estimates. The hon. Gentleman also had the honesty to admit that the troubles detailed in that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2670</span>
report could not possibly be purely the responsibility of this Government. He said that some buildings which had caused such anxiety had been condemned 50 years ago and in saying that, the hon. Gentleman admitted the letter of the N.U.T., published yesterday, which said that it was the fault of successive Governments, including two Labour Governments, that as a whole we had not spent enough on general capital investment within education.<br><br>
That covers the crux of the problem. We have to remember that the design of the Butler Act envisaged an expenditure of about £1,000 million which, even without a heavy Defence burden, would need at least 50 years to complete. Therefore, in this Committee we have to consider whether we are obtaining enough grant for the Education Estimates or whether other social services are geting more. We must not dodge the issue that as a country we are in a time of great trading difficulty, recovering from a severe financial crisis, and that therefore it is unlikely that the Education Estimates as a whole will allow of a very large increase.<br><br>
With what we have already, however, it is true to say that since the Government took office in 1951 they have tried to get as much value out of the money available as possible. As my right hon. Friend told us, we are spending £6·5 million on capital investment this year compared with £5·3 million last year, which shows a 23 per cent. increase.<br><br>
It is true that we have always to compete within the social services for the resources available, and there are many people who are deeply concerned at the fairly wide gap between the housing programme and the building of schools. We have to consider that in 1946 the late Government laid down quite clearly that there should be an overriding priority for housing. That is bound to mean that there is less to spend on educational building and so it is obvious that the gap must widen, particularly as the housing programme is successful. Also we should recognise the fact that while 1947 was the peak birth-rate year, we are bound now to be having the greater part of the bulge of the birth-rate coming into our schools.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2671</span>
We have to ask ourselves these questions. First, have we the right priority between the various capital investment programmes—defence, industrial development and social services? Secondly, have we the right priority within the social services? I have always maintained that the background of true education is the home. I feel that while it is discouraging for teachers to have to contend with some of the school conditions, nevertheless think how infinitely more discouraging it is to contend with those conditions which come from overcrowding and consequently unhappy homes.<br><br>
I want to ask the Under-Secretary of State whether a definite policy is being pursued of encouraging permanent house building and prefabricated school building. I say "prefabricated" because I read with the greatest interest that section of the Report which said that we could spend much less by using prefabricated methods and that this would help to close the gap between houses and school buildings. Furthermore, it is also suggested as a direct recommendation in this Report that we are perhaps building schools in Scotland which are too well built in present conditions of capital investment. I was glad to hear from the Secretary of State that a large number of recommendations made by the Select Committee have already been adopted.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I concentrate very much in advocating an increase of the housing programme because I also recall the Report on Reading Ability which was submitted to the late Socialist Minister of Education, Mr. Tomlinson, in which it was shown that much of the difficulty in reading ability was among children who came to school from unsatisfactory and overcrowded homes. The hon. Member for Tradeston quite rightly laid great stress on the effect this would have on the recruitment of teachers, and at the same time drew attention to the circular regarding entrance to training colleges which also was dealt with at some length by the hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison).<br><br>
I was interested to note that the hon. Member for Tradeston was, at any rate, honest enough not to try to shelter behind the polite courtesy of "women and children first." The origin of the term
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2672</span>
"women and children first" in early times was that when men went into battle and suspected an ambush they pushed the women and children first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why they are called "ducks."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member also seemed to suspect a sinister design in what, after all, may be the best places for women of the future. I think there is some confusion about the circular, which perhaps the Under Secretary could clear up for us. As the hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North told us, the circular does not really differ in content very much from the procedure in force already, officially, only behind the scenes. The circular gives official status to a procedure which to some extent does take place now, except in one important respect. I understand that there is no personality test imposed on entrants to training colleges. Therefore, the circular asks that at a personal interview a girl who has scored a near miss can gain entry into a training college. Furthermore that particular entrant will be most carefully supervised during her first year at the training college.<br><br>
I feel it is of the utmost importance that we should do everything in our power to try to widen the basis of recruitment to the teaching profession because, while we are agreed that it is of great importance to have academic qualifications, nevertheless there are certain qualities of character and certain gifts of teaching possessed by people who perhaps have not the ability to pass examinations. If we look at the circular and this endeavour in this light, remembering the safeguards specifically laid down, we should welcome this as a constructive measure to try to give as wide an entry as possible to the teaching profession.<br><br>
I have always felt when discussing the Education Estimates that we should discuss whether more should be spent on building or more on teachers' pay and conditions, and I always put the second subject first. This is an opportunity for us in Scotland to examine the curricula in the secondary schools. One important paragraph of the Report, which was referred to by the hon. Lady, shows that perhaps part of the trouble about the shortage of teachers is due to a general lack of educated men and women. Those men and women are coming largely from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2673</span>
our secondary schools and we are bound to ask if there is something wrong with the curricula. Have we perhaps not got everything right and as we would desire it to be?<br><br>
Although the Report tells us there is encouraging but very slow progress in most subjects, nevertheless, it is disturbing that many leave schools before they have completed their courses. I wonder whether in our desire to give as wide opportunities as possible to children as we can we are not spreading those opportunities too wide? Many intelligent people have said to me that at school they felt that they never had time to get really interested in a subject: they were constantly having to change from one subject to another. I think the flitting mind does lead to restless habits and in later life produces an adult who is unable to plan his or her day—the kind of person one often meets who says "There is never time." That comes from an untidy mind, a mind which in earlier days has not been trained really to concentrate on the essentials.<br><br>
I wonder if it is possible for the Under-Secretary, for instance, to give us any statistics on these lines? Can he tell us whether the ability of many National Service men to read and write is better or worse than it was in the last two or three years? There are very few ways in which we can test whether people who have left school benefit from general education or not. To give an example as it affects women, is it really necessary to teach homecrafts in the school, particularly when there is a shortage of domestic science teachers? It seems to me that if a girl is to learn cooking in one or two periods during the week, that is not nearly so beneficial as if she learns it at home in one class and under one teacher. She will learn it better there because she has the responsibility of having to prepare the meal. Then, on the subject of child welfare, surely a young woman, married and about to have a child, has nine months in which to learn how to bring up the child—or certainly ought to have.<br><br>
Needlework is a subject which I think should be taught in school because it has to be learnt from early days and is a restful subject which can be learned while, at the same time, good English can be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2674</span>
read to the class. I think that in these days women need a wider education, and domestic subjects could be learned at home, so that while at school they may have as wide a background of education as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with interest to the remarks of the noble Lady, but I am not sure how she reconciles the last point she made about homecraft being taught at home with the point she made earlier that overcrowding and bad conditions make it impossible for them to be homes in the normal sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That rather reinforces my point, because so many children, when they get home from school, particularly when they come to overcrowded conditions, are asked to help their mothers and have to take messages and help in the house. It seems better that they should learn homecrafts in that atmosphere than at school. The point about housing conditions reinforces the point I made about not having too wide a selection of subjects.<br><br>
If there is more time at school it can be used for the homework. When children come home tired and with a very great deal of homework to do, they have to undertake an almost impossible task. It would be a very valuable reform of education if part of the homework were done under discipline at school. Discipline in work gives a disciplined mind, a habit of mind and an attitude to work which is most valuable in later life.<br><br>
After all, nothing at all is achieved without a very great deal of grit and study which entails much concentration. The object of our education today is to give the child, until he or she leaves school, the ability to concentrate and the knowledge of how to learn and how to use the library so that the bulk of the education can be done after the age of 15 either at university or in the world at large. I think that if we reorganised the curricula a little more and concentrated on the three Rs we should give time for quiet study and teach the children to learn quietly, to be silent and delve deeply into the quiet of the mind. That is the object of education, to learn, and to learn to understand and, above all, to develop the desire for knowledge, which is the only true foundation for learning any subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very interested in what the noble Lady had to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2675</span>
pay, particularly about the disciplined mind and the basis for concentration, because I tried very hard to follow some of the things she was saying, but perhaps I lacked the concentration or she had not disciplined her mind sufficiently to her subject.<br><br>
In regard to secondary schools she spoke of the lack of people coming forward from the schools today and seemed to think there was something wrong with the curricula, but she stopped there and the next thing she was talking of was the lack of essentials. The essentials do not come from the secondary schools; they come from the primary schools.<br><br>
If the noble Lady looks at the Report she will see that in dealing with the question of children who leave school before they finish a five-year course or a three-year course, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence so far received shows clearly that the reasons are social and economic rather than educational."</p></blockquote>
The noble Lady went on to speak of dispensing with the teaching of homecrafts, but homecraft is taught not in the senior but in the junior secondary school. She felt that if we did away with homecraft the child could do more homework, and in emphasising that she said that what girls wanted today was a wider spread of knowledge and education—the very thing of which she was complaining, or seeming to complain, in regard to the senior secondary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to discipline my mind to enable concentration on the point, and I remember clearly saying that we needed concentration on the three Rs and the need to learn those subjects well, but that when we come to the stage of homecraft it can be taught at home, whilst there could be more concentration on homework at school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lady did better the second time than the first time, and it emphasises the need for concentration. When she tries to spread it out and to put flesh on the skeleton of her speech, she displays the need for a greater study of the subject—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir William Darling</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to get on with my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct a misapprehension?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2676</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is always anxious to correct a misapprehension. I want to make a slight reference to the subject which the noble Lady mentioned when she questioned whether or not we could afford a greater amount for the building of nursery schools and so on There is one factor of which the noble Lady must not lose sight. She said that she had read the Report of the Select Committee on Estimates. I am a member of that Committee, although I am not on the sub-Committee which dealt with the subject she mentioned. However, I know that unless we spend more on the expansion of our school programme, whereas in 1951 we had a net place deficit of 53,400 and last year—after one year of the noble Lady and her friends—the figure was 54,500, this year it will be 56,500 and in 1957 it will be 66,900 That is not allowing for any further in creases in the cost of building.<br><br>
12.0 noon.<br><br>
This is a serious situation. The matter is to be debated in the House of Commons tomorrow and I will not dwell on it now, but we cannot smooth over a problem of that nature. It is a most serious feature of Scottish education. We have always reckoned that the quality of education in Scotland is so much better than anywhere else. I have sometimes contested that but, allowing that it is true, where has it sprung from? It has sprung from the quality of our teachers. We have always been very strict, especially after the First World War, in our efforts to build up a teaching profession with high qualifications.<br><br>
I come back again to what was said by the noble Lady who talked about widening the basis of the people from whom we drew our teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reservoir.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One does not widen the basis of a reservoir.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Walter Elliot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does one make a reservoir except by widening a basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refuse to be side-tracked by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman The noble Lady seemed to think that by permitting the entry of young girls of 17 who had not quite achieved the leaving certificate standard academically she was thereby, somehow or other, widening the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2677</span>
basis of the educational reservoir—if hon. Gentlemen insist on that word. If she had made that remark when she was talking about the special recruitment scheme, she would have been quite justified. Some of the comments condemning the special recruitment scheme are completely beside the point. One of the advantages which teachers generally —not just Scottish teachers—lack is a wider contact with the world outside the school.<br><br>
I was very glad that the Joint Under-Secretary made his broadcast. Many of the people whom we have secured through the scheme have proved to be invaluable. Many of them are even better than some of the academically qualified teachers; but, coming back to the girls of 17, that is an entirely different matter. The dilution is something that will defeat its own aim even though it may be successful at the start. If we reduce qualifications in this way, then in the end we shall turn away to some other profession people who have reasonable and decent qualifications.<br><br>
It is an undoubted fact that this is causing disgruntlement among teachers. My hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) seemed to think that teachers should try to do something to encourage people to go from secondary schools into the teaching profession, but when we have disgruntled and unhappy teachers they are not exactly the best people to become propagandists for recruitment to their profession.<br><br>
Teachers are very much opposed to this lowering of their status. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Trades-ton (Mr. Rankin) spoke about the conditions of service in many schools. I taught for nine or 10 years in a school in the Gorbals. My hon. Friend did not paint too dismal a picture of the situation in some of the schools. When he spoke about the glass cages he omitted to say that on a wet morning in winter there were 50 or 60 wet coats hanging around the walls, the atmosphere being such outside that one dare not open a window. One can imagine the conditions that prevail in places like that.<br><br>
It is not only in industrial areas that we get dreadful conditions. Some of the rural schools, especially in winter, are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2678</span>
a disgrace to Scottish education. If we are to hand out any bouquets today we should hand them to the rural teachers. Some rural headmasters and headmistresses do a tremendous amount of work under the most terrifying difficulties. If some city teachers were faced with similar difficulties they would raise their hands and throw in their jobs.<br><br>
The teachers' case requires a certain amount of reconsideration. The Secretary of State should know that to cut salaries in a roundabout way is not the best method of securine recruits for a profession. The Secretary of State proposes to do that by increasing the teacher's superannuation contribution. The teachers know that the police have a superannuation scheme and they are not asked to pay any more. The civil servants have a scheme which is probably affected by recent rises in the same way as their scheme, but the civil servants are not asked to pay anything because they do not contribute towards the scheme at all. But the teachers are singled out to pay an increased contribution. The Government can explain that in any way they like, but to the teacher it is a decrease in his salary, and that does not make him better fitted in his attitude towards his profession to become a propagandist for it.<br><br>
I am equally concerned with many others about the question of wastage in senior secondary schools. The fact that 74 per cent. of those who left last year had not completed the full five-year course and that 10,500 left at the 15-year leaving age indicates a shocking waste of money, materials, teaching time and everything else. In many cases it is even a criminal waste because many of these children are keeping out of the senior secondary schools people now in junior secondary schools who would have completed the five-year course.<br><br>
This is very much a test of our educational system and of the Scottish attitude to education. What are the reasons given? They are not educational, but social and economic. There is the greater attraction outside of well-paid jobs which people are able to get without the arduous task of study, etc. I have always had a feeling that there has been a bias in Scottish education for the senior secondary school and that we have neglected everything else. The reason for that has not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2679</span>
been the love of education in itself and the need to enrich life through education but rather the vision of education as a way of escape—a way of escape into a better position financially. Teachers in the family, ministers and doctors in the family—it was a way out, and that to my mind has always been the weakness of Scottish education. The greater weakness has been our glorying in that and overloading all our attentions on the senior secondary schools.<br><br>
This is a challenge to Scottish parents and teachers. They should appreciate education for its own sake and see that that wide gap—spiritually and culturally —in our nation is quickly filled. How can it be filled? I have said before and I repeat that where we can do most good for Scottish education is in the junior secondary schools. That is a school untrammelled and unhampered by outside examination. It is the Cinderella of Scottish education.<br><br>
In a reference to English, the Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Opportunities of reading widely in school have been limited by the lack of school libraries and where libraries exist, free access has been restricted when use has had to be made of them as classrooms."</p></blockquote>
Can anyone tell me that Scots people are not preferred to provide junior secondary schools with decent libraries? Has any effort been made to acquire a decent library for every school? I am not satisfied about that.<br><br>
Then we come to geography, and the Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"…many of the smaller centres are handicapped in the carrying out of projects by the lack of modern maps, globes and pictorial matter."</p></blockquote>
A lack of maps, globes and pictures! The Scottish Education Department has a lot to answer for, and so have local education authorities, because we should remember that about seven out of every 10 children receive their last three years education in a junior secondary school.<br><br>
Now we come to mathematics about which the Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Progress, however, is limited by problems of staffing."</p></blockquote>
I know that I am picking out all the worst features, but that is our task here. Unlike the noble Lady, I have had experience of teaching in an industrial area and I have a little knowledge of teaching in rural areas in Aberdeenshire.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2680</span>
I should like to point out what is being done about homecraft in junior secondary schools. The Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a shortage of qualified teachers and in a number of areas uncertificated teachers have had to be employed…the development of the new approach to the teaching of homecraft has been hampered."</p></blockquote>
I come to the crux of my criticism of the junior secondary school. It will be found on page 29 of the Report and it has been recognised by the Department. I want to know, having pin-pointed the trouble, what they propose to do about it. The Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Broadly speaking, however, the presentation of subjects suffers from the influence of traditional methods current in senior secondary schools"—</p></blockquote>
The senior secondary school fills the whole of educational horizon. It mars the outlook for junior secondary schools—
<br><blockquote><p>"and is often more in accord with the practice there of 25 years ago than with the best practice of today."</p></blockquote>
There is little wonder when one reads further and finds that there is in Scotland almost no educational experiment in progress. Here is a whole field which cries out for experiments. It needs experiments, but another year has passed and little experiment is being done.<br><br>
What is the root of the trouble? It is this failure to accept the challenge to experiment. There is another thing wrong. I am not satisfied that the Inspectorate is properly doing its task if it allows this situation to continue. There is also the question of promotion. It is inevitable in junior secondary schools that we should get a copying of the traditional methods of the senior secondary school if, whenever there is a headmastership available, there is put into the junior secondary school a man who has spent 25 years in a senior secondary school. He is a man who has never had experience of this kind and he tries to make a junior secondary school into a little sort of secondhand senior secondary school. We want to get away from that idea altogether.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I ask the Secretary of State to give us an answer on this point. What is being done about this acute problem of the junior secondary schools? Here is a great chance for Scotland to show education not as a step towards something
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2681</span>
else in the outside world, but as a process for the enrichment of the personality of the child. That is the real test of education. The hon. Lady was right when she said that education is a success only if, at the end of formal education, personal education started. If we can implant that idea in children so that they carry on their studies of the subjects that they acquire in their last three years, we shall be doing something worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to say a few words about the staffing situation in Scotland, which subject gives probably most concern in educational circles, and particularly the shortage of teachers in mathematics and science. We have discussed the matter on many occasions in this Committee. Perhaps we should not allow ourselves to be too gloomy about the staffing outlook. We can note with satisfaction, as the Minister pointed out in his remarks, that the number of oversize classes in most primary and secondary schools has decreased appreciably during the past year. The position is given in Table 4 of the Annual Report. Moreover, the average number of pupils per certificated teacher, 24·4, has remained steady, in spite of the fact that the school population has increased by 18,500 children since a year ago. The Secretary of State and the Scottish Education Department are very right to look ahead, because the position will deteriorate unless we can attract and train more teachers in the immediate future.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State made a broadcast on this matter fairly recently. He was quite right to do so. I was very surprised to read in the papers the rebukes which were administered to him by one or two persons prominent in the teaching world, on the ground, apparently, that it was rather lowering to the dignity of the profession for a public appeal to be made for new entrants. That was a narrow and somewhat unreasonable attitude to adopt. The radio is a most useful instrument for putting over views to the public and appealing for support of all sorts of good works. We would be very wrong not to make use of modern scientific equipment designed to assist all phases of our national life. I have heard broadcasts several times before, appealing for persons to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2682</span>
enter certain professions, such as the nursing profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And Civil Defence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and the Services. I see nothing wrong with it. Any Government or responsible Minister would be wrong not to make use of every appropriate agency for attracting people to join a very noble and essential profession.<br><br>
For a moment I would refer to complaints by teachers' organisations of the draft Regulations for the entry and training of teachers. Like other hon. Members, I have received circulars and correspondence on this subject from the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association. If the new proposals are looked at purely from the academic and the set examination point of view, I can see that the teachers' organisations can make a case, but I believe, as I think many other people do, that personality is an important matter in teaching, and that one should not concentrate entirely on the ability of teachers to shine in written examinations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of shining, but of passing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had experience of examinations and I know it is easy to have nerves and come a cropper. Most of us, I fancy, have had experience of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. and gallant Member realises from the description I gave that if it is only a case of coming a cropper and going below, those circumstances are taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I listened to what the hon. Lady said. So far as I can see, the new Regulations are an amplification of the present personality selection process by putting it on a more regular basis. It is worth while trying it out. It is rather an important matter. A lot of people are very good at writing down things and not so good at expressing them in public, and certainly not at imparting knowledge to others. The ability of teachers to drive home in an interesting manner a subject which they are teaching so that it interests the child and sticks in its memory is most important. That is where personality comes into the field of education. The Department are justi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2683</span>
fied in experimenting with personality tests in marginal cases where the candidate has failed to get just sufficient qualifying marks. I agree that we shall have to keep this innovation under review, but, having regard to the existing and prospective shortage of teachers, we are entitled to try out the scheme.<br><br>
There are two other matters concerning teachers about which I have had a certain amount of correspondence. The first relates to a grievance which is felt by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association in regard to the supply—perhaps it would be more correct to say the "non-supply"—of official memoranda and literature. I know that there is a complicated background here, and that this is a tricky subject. I do not wish to say anything this morning that will make more difficult the relations between the E.I.S. and the S.S.T.A. I will leave out the major question of recognition of status.<br><br>
On the particular point it would be desirable, in the interests of the pupils, who should be our first consideration, that any papers or documents which make easier, more interesting or helpful the work of the teacher should be available to all teachers, regardless of the organisation they may happen to support. That is necessary in the interests of the children themselves. Questions regarding the status of particular teachers' organisations should not be allowed to enter into this question. I hope that the Joint Under-Secretary will look at this problem, which has given rise to a number of letters and circulars from the secondary teachers. It is a small point which can be dealt with in isolation from the very much bigger controversial problem.<br><br>
One matter is of special interest in Edinburgh, and I would like my hon. Friend to deal with it. A year ago I raised the question of negotiating machinery for the salary scales of the teachers in the Edinburgh College of Art. Those who take an interest in this matter will know that relations have not been very harmonious between the governing body and the teachers in this institution. The last information I had on this matter was that there was a possibility of the dispute going to arbitration. I do not know whether an arbitrator has been appointed or whether any proceedings have actually started yet, and I would be grateful if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2684</span>
the Joint Under-Secretary could say a word about this matter in his winding-up speech. It is very desirable that the best possible relations should be preserved between the staff of the College of Art and the governing body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacPherson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for Edinburgh, West (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison) has taken the opportunity, quite rightly, to supplement what he had to say about major problems by dealing with two minor problems, a perfectly sensible thing to do. He was a little too overoptimistic about the major problems, and he rather missed the point about the Joint Under-Secretary's broadcast.<br><br>
Of course, there is no objection to using this medium, but the subject matter of the broadcast was just a little depressing. In the long run, when one considers it fully, what he said suggests a somewhat pessimistic outlook. He took, for example, a fairly ordinary, not very high, middle-class salary of £1,500 a year, and said that out of 33,000 teachers in Scotland 150 were getting that salary. That is not a particularly attractive picture. Remember that there are 200 senior secondary schools in Scotland, and that not even the headmasters of senior secondary schools can aspire to that very modest salary in all cases. I think it was on that sort of ground that exception was taken to the broadcast, and not to the fact that it was a broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me recall to the hon. Gentleman, because I have the actual excerpt here, the report of the observations of Dr. Murison, President of the E.I.S., on the broadcast. He said that
<br><blockquote><p>"it was appalling that a great profession such as theirs should in this age of enlightenment and progress have to tout"—</p></blockquote>
he used the word advisedly—
<br><blockquote><p>"for recruits by such adventitious and haphazard methods."</p></blockquote>
That does not seem to be a very good way of dealing with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacPherson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the general line of criticism has been broader than that and generally directed to the substance of the Under-Secretary of State's broadcast.<br><br>
The debate has been concerned, as one would expect it to be, in this Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2685</span>
with various aspects of the problem of sharing national resources between other demands and education. The day has gone past when we can expect to solve our educational problems without taking into account the demands of other parts of the national economy. The Secretary of State's opening statement was a little lacking in the sense of urgency that the whole problem needs. It did not seem to suggest in any way that any of the serious problems that confront education today were being tackled with any great degree of energy. In fact, he was inclined more to state them to suggest vigorous tackling of them.<br><br>
He began by talking about the education of secondary pupils, and I was very largely in agreement with what he said as to our approach being too academic. I do not think there is any doubt that it is. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) stressed that the great majority of people who take secondary education do not take the academic line of the senior secondary school.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I think that we can all remember my hon. Friend stressing, in previous debates, what a great many of us must feel in strong agreement with—that the junior secondary school has a very great future if we can only use with it with the proper degree of discretion, vigour and belief in it. The hon. Gentleman coupled with that suggestion the fact that a very large number of pupils leave secondary schools, including the senior secondary schools, very early. There is no doubt that that particular wastage is extraordinarily high. I am not quite sure that the Department's Report gives the full explanation of it.<br><br>
They attribute it mainly to economic causes. These are strong without any doubt, and I think that it is one of the scandals of our economic system today that young people should be attracted in their teens away from school by the extraordinarily high wages with which they are tempted by industry. That itself is a thoroughly bad feature of our present day social life, but I think that there is something a little beyond that. This is not due entirely to the play of economic forces, as I see it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2686</span>
The capital difficulty about the over fifteens is that they want to be at the business of life. They do not want, in many cases, to be doing something connected with school and school rooms. It is all right for the child of a professional family, who grows up in the belief that one, studies at school until the age of 18, and for certain social classes who also take that belief, but for the great majority of young people there is restlessness about this time to get at something practical, something with adult connections, something that is not a matter of the classroom and school teaching.<br><br>
That is a difficulty which must be overcome in the programme—to which I give all good wishes—which, I understand, the Government will attempt to put into effect for encouraging young people to stay at school. I do not know how they are going to overcome that particular problem without using resources, methods, arguments and persuasion which have not so far been revealed to us. I cite in support of this analysis of the difficulties the very interesting experience in the Army in recent years.<br><br>
I think that we have all noticed, in many cases with something like wonder, the reports about the way in which the Army have educated illiterates and semi-illiterates and, by magic it would seem, have turned them into people who can read and write perfectly well. The lesson of that is not any secret of methods. The Army have borrowed their methods from the schools. The lesson of that is the terrific impetus to learning which is given to an individual who feels that he wants to learn the tools of the world he is in, and that is a thing which is lacking for many pupils in the later stages of the secondary school. They feel that they are learning something from books but that the outside world is going along without them.<br><br>
I reinforce strongly what the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) said about the future of the junior secondary school and the type of pupils who go there. The problem is an immensely difficult one, and I think that the Report has been too facile in saying that the difficulties are economic. The economic difficulties are there, but there is a good deal more to it than that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2687</span>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to deal with the subject of technical education, and, again, I think, he was a little lacking in urgency. The Report describes the development of technical education as being a slow and patchy one. There are difficulties of staffing and of building as there are in education generally. There is also a certain difficulty in a country which has been used to the study of classics and philosophy moving over to a different type of study altogether, giving it a different priority to what it used to have in the academic world. Allowing for all the difficulties, we are still too far behind as a nation in technical education.<br><br>
The Royal Technical College has no superiors and possibly no equal in the country, but when we come to the middle ranges the Report has to comment that there is hardly a local technical college that is really worth calling a college, and in the matter of support from industry for trade courses and that kind of thing, technical education for the youngsters in their teens, our system is nothing like so well-developed as it ought to be.<br><br>
I am bound to say that in spite of all the arguments put to me from one source and another, I have some doubt whether the emphasis on regional organisation in technical education is sound. I know that local and regional organisation is the sort of thing to which we are accustomed in ordinary education, but surely the aim of technical education is very largely set by the needs of individual industries, the development of which may be a matter of national interest There is, of course, co-operation between the regions and the educational committees and the centre, but there should be a far stronger impetus and initiative coming from the centre. There should be less dependence on the impetus and initiative of the regions.<br><br>
One remark about technical education in the Department's Report struck me as being well worth re-emphasising. That is the statement that technical education should not be concerned simply with those people who are looking for promotion. It should be concerned with the working people at all levels, and in point of fact one of the tremendous values which technical education may have for our civilisation is just the ability to fill out the ordinary daily routine interest of the worker by a tremendous range of other things connected with his work. It may,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2688</span>
in fact, in the end turn out to be not simply technical education in the narrow sense, but education in the broadest sense.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to deal with the supply of teachers, and during the debate a certain amount of attention has been concentrated on the recent circular. I do not want to go into too much detail about that. My first approach on a question like this is not altogether hostile, but the details of that circular struck me as being singularly unpleasant. It is, for instance, possible, as has been stressed, for an individual to enter a training college without a Leaving Certificate pass in English. English, in spite of its linguistic title, is a subject not concerned so much with language as with thought. Success in English means the ability to understand a line of thought and to express a line of thought. It really is difficult to see any justification for admitting young people who fail in that particular subject.<br><br>
In addition, there is no evidence that the interview will in any way test person ality. Everyone realises now, I think, after the experience of the last few years, that interviewing is a difficult technique. I need not go into the variations of it which have been developed, but it is not by any means a certainty that an interviewer will pick out the right type of personality. Furthermore, the training college examination is not like the examination of a university, set at as high a standard and at as unshakable a level as that body likes to make it.<br><br>
The university examination is something which is almost untouchable and set as high as they want it. In this respect I do not think that the training centre would be immune from a certain amount of pressure from the Government of the day or from public opinion, and since the people coming in now will be emerging three or four years hence, there may be time for such pressure to grow. From where does the Under-Secretary get his figure of 250? The only figure he can have is the figure of near-misses, which may be 250, but that does not give the figure of those who will be cut out by the interview and by examinations. I should like to know how he gets that estimate of 250.<br><br>
One final point which I should like to touch on before the Joint Under-Secretary replies relates to a question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2689</span>
which has had a good deal of attention today and recently in the educational world; that is the question of increasing the pool of well-educated young people from which the teaching and other professions can draw. It is, I think, thoroughly in the national interest to increase that pool. But it is going to be extremely difficult, and it is going to be necessary also to decrease the demands on it. It is no good allowing the size of the pool to increase if we allow the size of the demands to increase in proportion. The nation will certainly have more educated people, but this will not solve the problem we are dealing with here, that of the shortage of teachers.<br><br>
I should like to read the Committee a statement made by the headmaster of a well known Edinburgh school a year or two ago. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The number of boys who completed a full secondary course nowadays, as compared with 50 years ago, had greatly increased, with the result that the standard required for entry to several professions had been raised. Even 30 years ago four passes in the intermediate certificate, a third year examination, sufficed for entry to a C.A. apprenticeship. Admission to a medical course could be gained with the same certificate, and, indeed, boys unable to gain that certificate could be admitted to the Faculty of Medicine if they passed a special preliminary examination, the standard of which was notoriously low."</p></blockquote>
The Joint Under-Secretary will have noticed, for example, that, in the course of the last few days, the General Nursing Council want to raise their standard. There has been a complaint by the headmaster I have quoted of the standard of Higher Mathematics demanded in pharmacy which does seem to me a little irrelevant to the needs of pharmacy. If teaching is going to benefit by the increase of this national pool it is going to be necessary—I will not develop the theme beyond putting it—for something more in the way of a national policy about manpower, and particularly about educated manpower, to be in the minds of whatever Government is in power. We cannot just allow competition to solve a question like that, otherwise the pull of the professions, industries and commercial occupations which have the big money behind them will bring about the same situation in the teaching profession as we have today.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2690</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Henderson Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember a debate on Scottish education which has been better informed and carried through in a better temper than this one. I am sure that has been welcomed on all sides of the Committee. In the time at my disposal my reply must necessarily be truncated, and I may not be able to deal with all the questions that have been raised. If any hon. Members feel that I have not dealt adequately with their points, I shall be happy to write to them.<br><br>
To deal with one small matter at the beginning, my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison) asked about the problem of sending round circulars to the S.S.T.A. I do not think it would be satisfactory to agree merely to send circulars, since the S.S.T.A. would obviously want opportunities of consultation also. I feel that the solution is what the hon. Lady and right hon. Gentlemen opposite thought when they were in office, namely, to get the E.I.S. and the S.S.T.A. to come together again. I have done my utmost to bring about a reconciliation; I shall continue to do so. and I hope to succeed. The other point he raised was about the trouble at the College of Art. I understand that both parties there have now put the matter to arbitration and so I think we cannot do much more about it.<br><br>
12.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) and others raised the matter of junior secondary schools, and the hon. Lady for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) raised it in a wider context and referred to the possibilities of comprehensive schools. I agree with the hon. Member for Kilmarnock that the place of the junior secondary school needs close examination. A group of our inspectors have been looking into this matter, and soon they will be sending recommendations to us, some of which I gather will be interesting and novel. I hope that next year we may be able to report changes which we intend to carry out.<br><br>
I have sympathy for the comprehensive school. As the hon. Lady knows, I was brought up in one and was a member of the Advisory Council on Education which recommended in favour of them,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1952-1953V000P0I1405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2691</span>
although they saw the disadvantages. The truth is that there are both advantages and disadvantages, and we cannot generalise. I do not think anybody would say that all schools should be comprehensive, and that there should be no junior secondary schools. Each area varies in its history and tradition. Where there is the comprehensive school tradition, it is difficult to shift it; where that does not exist, the junior secondary school is better, and many of these have already created a fine place for themselves in Scotland.<br><br>
Therefore, the answer is that we shall be guided by local conditions and we do not want to lay down any rules. It is for the local authorities themselves to decide, and we shall be ready to do what seems best in each circumstance. As the hon. Lady knows, Glasgow are planning their new secondary schools as comprehensive schools, but I am not aware of any other local authorities asking for the same provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there any plans for Lanarkshire?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but I will try to inform the hon. Lady. The main debate has been upon the shortage of teachers and school buildings. I will leave school buildings until the end because it is clear that we shall have a debate on that point tomorrow. Let me face up at once to the situation about the supply of teachers. The hon. Lady suggested that the only plan we have to meet this difficult problem is the lowering of standards. I know she did not quite mean that, but perhaps I should tell the Committee that we have many plans. We have been exceedingly busy this year preparing for action to meet the grave and increasing shortage of teachers.<br><br>
Some of our plans are already in action. For example, we are trying to encourage more children to stay on at school—a point so well put by the hon. Lady. Everybody recognises that we shall not get more teachers or doctors or any of the other highly qualified technical experts so much needed in this age unless more children go on to the higher secondary school courses. We are trying to achieve this by a variety of means.<br><br>
One way is by increasing bursaries. The Committee will have noticed the new draft Bursary Regulations and we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2692</span>
had various views expressed upon them, My right hon. Friend has to make up his mind what he will do about those representations, but sooner or later, the final approved draft will be presented to the House and, I hope, passed so that students entering college in October may have the approved and increased scales.<br><br>
We are planning carefully to do precisely what the hon. Lady asked, namely, to use further propaganda. She is quite right. Why should the I.C.I., the Forces, and so many other great organisations approach the Universities—even the schools in a roundabout way—and say what a grand career they can offer and also put up posters all over the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Thomas Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They also offer better salaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why should not education also attract people to its great teaching service? We are proposing to do that. The hon. Lady used to broadcast in her time, and I try humbly to follow in her footsteps. I will take her advice and do some more if the broadcasting people will permit me to do so, though I am not so sure that I should be as appealing on television as she would be.<br><br>
We are preparing material for distribution in the schools. We are preparing for lectures in the Universities by competent people on the advantages of teaching as a career. We are proposing an investigation through the "Social Survey" into the deterrents which prevent people from entering this profession. We have been advised to do that by some of the experts. As my right hon. Friend announced, we propose to set up a Committee to inquire into the supply of teachers of mathematics and science. We also propose to alter the regulations governing admission to training.<br><br>
This brings me to the main contention this morning. Let me tell the Committee about the position in which we find ourselves. I ask hon. Members to consider this dispassionately. My right hon. Friend has no desire, and certainly I have not, to debase in any way the standards of the teaching profession. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Tradeston (Mr. Rankin) asked for a guarantee that this would not be extended. I cannot give promises of that kind, but this far I can

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2693</span>
go: so far as my right hon. Friend and I can foresee, we have no intention of extending this in any way. There is, however, a peculiar and pressing problem in regard to women non-graduate teachers.<br><br>
There are in our schools at present about 12,000 non-graduate certificated women teachers in primary schools. The number required to replace the annual wastage of those teachers through death, retirement and marriage is about 540. The present output from the training colleges of these same teachers is 560, so we are about keeping pace. But, as the (hon. Lady showed in her speech, the committee which dealt with the supply of teachers proved that there will be an increasing shortage.<br><br>
To overcome the staffing deficiency which in primary schools is about 1,550, we have to take special steps. Obviously of that 1,550 not all would be non-graduate teachers; some might be graduates. Putting the number of non-graduates at 1,200 it means that to clear the deficiency by 1960 our total annual need for these primary school women teachers is 740 and our total annual supply is only 560. Therefore, we arrive at an annual shortage of roughly 200.<br><br>
We have to do something about it. At the moment, in order to enter, this type of girl must have two higher and three lower passes. Provided she has passes in those five subjects, she can walk right into the college although she may be a most unsuitable person for teaching. That cannot be right. We are proposing to add a new qualification for some of them, namely a test of personality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would that be applied to all schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take it step by step?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing out steps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain this in my own way. Supposing there is a girl who, instead of getting 51 per cent. in French, gets only 49 per cent. but, on personal examination, is found to be well-qualified so far as all the attributes of teaching are concerned, the proposal is that the training authority shall have the right to say, "Yes,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2694</span>
we will accept that exceptional case." I ask the Committee to believe that this is all we are asking. The Department does not intend to issue a directive to the colleges. [<i>Laughter.</i>] If the Committee will allow me to continue in my own way, I will tell hon. Members all they want to know.<br><br>
The National Committee have reached the following decisions on how they will act if the Amendment becomes law. First, failure by more than five marks—that is to say a percentage—will make the student ineligible for compensation in terms of personality. Anybody who gets lower than five marks is out altogether. That is the limit of the concession. Secondary, the assessment of personality will be undertaken by senior officials in the several colleges. Interviews will normally be conducted by three persons, and in no case by less than two. The interviewing group will, except in exceptional cases, include the Director of Studies and the Dean of Women. The group will consider in all cases the marks made in all subjects at the Leaving Certificate Examination and a report from the headmaster.<br><br>
The hon. Lady and other hon. Members pleaded with me that English should not be the subject of a concession. I am inclined to agree with her that English should be sacrosanct. It may well be that when we receive all the representations on this draft regulation, we shall agree to that proviso being made. That being so, I hope the Committee will agree—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —on account of its limited application to a certain number of people, that it is not unreasonable. We are 200 teachers short. What is the alternative? The Committee do not ask us to close down our classes, so we must get teachers for the primary schools, and this is one way by which that can be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cheap education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not taken this step without advice. I have seen the education authorities. I have seen the E.I.S., and they were opposed to it. I have seen the National Committee and they approved it. I have consulted a great many people. The Headmasters' Association sent us a memorandum in which this was not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2695</span>
mentioned. The Headmistresses' organisation told us that they support it. Therefore, we have been advised by what we consider the best sources of advice that this is a perhaps unfortunate but necessary step.<br><br>
I realise that I have not answered half the questions put to me, but perhaps tomorrow some of us may get a chance to say a word or two about buildings. All I can say at the moment is that Scotland has come out of the examination by the Select Committee not too badly—[An HON. MEMBER: "Very badly."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shocking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. Hamilton) is a little wrong. Anyway, the recommendations made by the Committee have nearly all been accepted by us.</span></p>
<p>1.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Colonel Gomme-Duncan.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2696</span>
Could we not have an extra quarter of an hour?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid not. It is only allowed when a decision has to be reached, and no decision has to be reached now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. M. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be a Division before the Committee decides to pass the Estimates and, in view of that, it may be worth while to give the Joint Under-Secretary another quarter of an hour. He has apologised for lack of time and I am sure we would willingly give this extra time to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of Order to do so.</span></p>
<p><i>It being after One o'Clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee, without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
<p>Committee adjourned until Wednesday, 1st July, at Half-past Ten o'Clock.</p>
