—(POWER TO BORROW BY MEANS OF BONDS.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed [11th June],</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned, I was dealing with several points in connection with this Clause, and especially in connection with the Schedule, which we are taking with it. I was mainly concentrating on paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Schedule, which deal with certain powers of the Secretary of State. Paragraph 4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority bonds may be issued by a local authority at such price as the authority may from time to time determine, but not, without the consent of the Secretary of State, at a discount."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) think it likely that such a contingency will arise? My view is that it is a very remote possibility.<br><br>
Paragraph 5(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority bonds shall, without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, be issued, transferred, dealt with and redeemed upon such terms and in accordance with such provisions as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury; and any such regulations may, in relation to any local authority bonds, apply (with or without modifications) any provisions of any enactments relating to stock or debentures issued by or mortgages created by a local authority."</p></blockquote>
In view of what we have already agreed in two Clauses, does not the hon. Gentleman think it possible for this to be done without the approval of the Secretary of State being necessary? I think that this could be left with the local authorities, as I am quite sure they would not act against their own good interests.<br><br>
Without my pressing this matter further, perhaps the hon. Member will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
agree to consider whether paragraph 4 is necessary at all, and whether or not he should look, before Report, at paragraph 5 so as to leave the power solely with the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Clause is to introduce a new and simple method for Scottish local authorities to borrow capital money. In the past, they have been able to borrow money for housing purposes only on a very simple type of document called a housing bond. Unfortunately, they have not had power to borrow for other purposes on these bonds but have had to rely on a very cumbersome method—.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dealing with that point, some local authorities have quite successfully operated a municipal bank, and in that way have done all sorts of borrowing for any purpose they have thought fit within their areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. G. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Blackburn. Can you tell us whether the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) is on this Committee? I see him sitting in the Committee, but I do not see him on the list of Members of this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It surprises me, too, but I have the latest list of Members of the Committee, and the hon. Member's name appears on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can you explain this, Mr. Blackburn? Of course, we have nothing whatever against the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), but our experience has been that when we have wanted to make a change it has been virtually impossible except in the case of a Ministerial change, with one Minister being substituted for another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is something done by the Committee of Selection, and it is a matter which should be argued out in the House: it is not something over which this Committee has control but something done by the Committee of Selection. In the Votes and Proceedings there is a report from the Committee of Selection that they added the hon. Member's name to the list of members of this Committee. As I say, this is not something that we can decide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
here. We cannot argue about it here. If hon. Members do not agree with the appointment, it is something that must be taken up in the House and with the Committee of Selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask, Mr. Blackburn, whether this is in substitution for someone else and, if so, who the someone else is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been informed that a member of this Committee has been transferred to another place, and that is regarded as the equivalent of a death.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Equivalent of a death? Hear, hear!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Blackburn. Can we have an assurance that this has not been done simply to compensate for the lack of enthusiasm shown by Government supporters in attending this Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have no knowledge of that; nor, I think, would the Committee of Selection</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was about to explain, the methods by which a local authority may borrow are, for the most part, set forth in Section 260 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947. Generally speaking, that Act lays down five methods of borrowing.<br><br>
The first method is by means of a document called a mortgage. Here, I must give a special explanation to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), whom I misled previously by saying that the word "mortgage" had no meaning in Scotland. It has a meaning in Scotland when applied to a method of local authority borrowing whereby a local authority, by means of a very cumbersome deed, puts a charge upon its rates and revenues. That is a very old-fashioned type of deed, and it is also a very expensive one. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) as already mentioned the large fees which have been customarily incurred by local authorities when borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board, which has insisted on getting mortgages on loans to local authorities. The type of bond envisaged in this Bill will very largely take the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
place of these mortgages, which are now old-fashioned, cumbersome and expensive.<br><br>
The next three methods by which local authorities may borrow are overdrafts, cash credit accounts, and temporary loans or deposit receipts. These are temporary borrowings which are extremely useful, but as they are not really suitable for long-term borrowings I need say no more about them now.<br><br>
The fifth method envisaged by the 1947 Act is the issue of stock. That is a convenient method for big cities and the larger counties, but it is not really practicable for the small burghs—or even some of the smaller large burghs—because, generally speaking, it is not practicable to issue stock on the market in sums of less than about £3 million at any one time, and that is only practicable for a very large authority.<br><br>
There are several other ways in which borrowing can be done, but they are mostly internal methods, such as setting up capital funds of the type envisaged by the Bill, or borrowing from internal sources, or borrowing in the rather irregular but very ingenious way mentioned by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire—the setting up of municipal banks. These, however, are not practical means of getting the big sums of money which local authorities need on a long-term basis.<br><br>
It has been found by local authorities in Scotland that the issue of housing bonds is a very convenient way of raising money. These bonds are issued for varying periods—generally five years, but sometimes more—and they have the great advantage of being renewable without the issue of a new bond. When the period runs out, the local authority simply puts a minute on the bond in order to renew it. This has the great advantage to the local authority of a saving of Stamp Duty. Stamp Duty is payable to the Treasury on the issue of a new bond, but this is avoided by renewal.<br><br>
It is also a very convenient way of transferring a debt from one person to another. For instance, if the holder of the bond dies it is very easy to transfer it to the relatives, or even to sell the bond, just by means of a letter to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
local authority. That does not carry Stamp Duty either, whereas a transfer of stock involves a rather heavy Stamp Duty. My proposal is that the same type of bond should be widened to include all the activities of a local authority.<br><br>
Having given mat introduction, it would be proper for me now to deal with the Schedule, which has been particularly mentioned by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire, who has considerable experience of these matters. Paragraph 1 calls for very little comment at all, as it simply deals with the terms on which the bond may be issued. Paragraph 1(a) states that the bonds shall
<br><blockquote><p>"bear interest at such rate as the local authority may determine at the time of the issue of the bonds".</p></blockquote>
and (<i>b</i>) states that the bonds may be issued in denominations of £5 and multiples of that sum. I do not envisage that a local authority will issue many bonds of such low denomination as £5, but I think that in the case of small burghs, in particular, it would be a convenience for them to be able to issue a bond for as little as that for the purpose of small savings. My experience of small burgh borrowings is that a lot of people of modest means are only too willing to lend money in comparatively small sums to the local authority, because they then know that the money is invested locally in a safe security in which they have trust. I think that the small denomination will be quite useful.<br><br>
Paragraph 1(c) provides that the bonds shall be isued for periods of not less than a year. That is necessary, because there are already provisions for temporary borrowing, and what I have in mind for this bond is not short-period borrowing but long-period borrowing, which is essential if a local authority is looking ahead in a wise way. Paragraph 2 provides that the period for which any local authority bonds are issued may be extended for a further period. That arrangement has been found extremely useful because, as I say, it saves Stamp Duty on the issue of new bonds, and has been found generally useful in the case of housing bonds. Paragraph 3 contains the Stamp Duty provision which is exactly the same as that applying to housing bonds, and has proved the means of a convenient saving to local authorities which are issuing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
bonds for fairly long periods. It simplifies the method of transfer, and also saves Stamp Duty.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 contains an interesting provision which has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority bonds may be issued by a local authority at such price as the authority may from time to time determine, but not, without the consent of the Secretary of State, at a discount."</p></blockquote>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The reason the central Government's consent must be necessary in the case of a bond being issued at a discount is that one automatically gives the lender an Income Tax advantage at the end of the period. If a bond of £100 is issued at £98, the effect is that the lender obtains £2 free of Income Tax at the end of the period. The advantage of issuing a bond at a discount is that one gets away from rates of interest, but in municipal bonds it is not necessary as a rule to issue at a discount.<br><br>
I think that hon. Members will agree that, if bonds are to be issued at a discount, with an Income Tax advantage to the lender, then the consent of the central Government, whether in the form of the Secretary of State or of the Treasury, is a very right and proper thing to have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased with the way the hon. Gentleman is dealing with the points I made, but could he give any single instance where a local authority has issued bonds at a discount?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Member of any case where a local authority bond has been issued at a discount, but I think that the hon. Member will know that very often local authority stock is issued at discount. That is rather important, I understand, in dealing with the money market I am not very experienced in the money market, but I understand that, when very large sums of stocks are being dealt with, a very small difference in the rates of interest may make a difference to the outcome. I do not think there is any practical need to issue bonds of this kind at a discount, but if, in the event of an issue of bonds being desirable at a discount, it seems right and proper that Government consent should be sought because of the tax implications.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
Paragraph 5 provides for regulations to be made by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury for the issue and transfer of the bonds. I think it essential to give power to some central authority to make detailed regulations from time to time. Such regulations are probably not suitable for inclusion in a permanent Statute. They could be amended from time to time if they were not included in a Statute. For instance, they might contain the form of the bond; someone must lay down the form of the document which, in the case of housing bonds, is very simple. Certainly, that is not suitable for a Statute. Someone must lay down regulations governing the transfer of bonds. The procedure in the case of housing bonds is quite simple, but it would be a pity if they were only transferable by deed of transfer in the same way as Stock Exchange securities. There would be all the complications, Stamp Duty and so forth.<br><br>
I am afraid that I cannot help the Committee about the detailed contents of the regulations. I understand that detailed regulations are being formulated at the moment for use in England and Wales for similar bodies, but these regulations have not yet been published. From my inquiries, I understand that they will deal with matters of detail, are administrative, and will in no way make things difficult for local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During his explanation of all these paragraphs the hon. Gentleman has been telling us why he put these provisions into the Bill. Could he give us some idea of what he had in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that was just what I had been doing. There are a great many details such as I have mentioned—the actual contents of the documents, the method of transfer, and so forth. It seems essential that a central authority should make these regulations and that the consent of the Treasury should be necessary since, no matter what Government are in power, they will have some sort of capital borrowing policy. It is surely right and proper, therefore, that the Treasury should have a say in regulations affecting the trans-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
fer and issue of bonds of this kind. Paragraph 5(1) of the Schedule simply says that these regulations will be made in the ordinary way by Statutory Instrument, which will be subject to annulment by resolution of either House. Parliament will, therefore, have the final say.<br><br>
I think there is little more that I can usefully say at this stage about these bonds, but I draw the Committee's attention to a paragraph in a document issued by the Convention of Royal Burghs. The document is called "Burrowes Lettrez" and dated March, 1964. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is hoped that Scottish Burgh Councils will soon be able to make use of this attractive means of borrowing, but that cannot happen until the Local Government (Development and Finance) (Scotland) Bill receives Royal Assent."</p></blockquote>
I mention that purely to show that this proposal has the blessing at any rate of the Convention of Royal Burghs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the advice the hon. Member has given with regard to the local authorities but, of course, he has not been helpful with regard to the speed with which we have been getting the Bill through. We are faced again with the same problem. He has said today that the Schedule will empower the Government to approve regulations, but he is unable to say what those regulations will contain. This Bill is introduced by a Private Member but it is a Government Bill. The hon. Member is able to tell us what is in his mind but not what the regulations will contain. Unless the powers in the regulations—or the powers we are to give for regulations—are more clearly indicated in the Schedule then it makes complete nonsense.<br><br>
Paragraph 1(a) says that the bonds shall
<br><blockquote><p>"bear interest at such rate as the local authority may determine at the time of the issue of the bonds".</p></blockquote>
According to that, the local authority will have complete freedom, but paragraph 5 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority bonds shall … be issued, transferred, dealt with and redeemed upon such terms and in accordance with such provisions as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
Thus, in the Schedule there is the appearance, first, of giving local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0621">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
authorities full freedom, but later it says that the Government will be able to determine the question.<br><br>
This is a Government Bill, so surely the Under-Secretary of State should be able to tell us exactly what is to be in the regulations. Will they indicate the interest charges? Will they fix a certain figure? The purpose of paragraph 5 is to give the Government power to lay down these regulations. A local authority wishing to issue these bonds will have to ask the Secretary of State, who will consider what the regulations should contain and will then consult the Treasury. Thus we arrive again at the old position. On the one hand, it is indicated that the local authorities will have full freedom and on the other that the Secretary of State and the Treasury are to determine the circumstances.<br><br>
We are unable to look at an English Statute to give an indication of what will happen. The hon. Gentleman mentioned some sources of information of which we are unaware. He has been informed that regulations are now being framed but he is unable to tell us what is in them. He had a very large brief with him today, but I am not sure where he got it. Perhaps over the weekend he dictated it to his secretary. Or he may have got it from some other source of information. In any case, the Under-Secretary of State should be able to tell us a little more about this. I see that the Under-Secretary of State is looking at his brief. Perhaps it is the same as that read by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I do not know whether the Under-Secretary will read it or not. From our experience, it would not take him as long, because, if there is one thing about his speeches, it is that they have been very brief. Here is his opportunity to indicate to us what will be contained in the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly support the Clause and the Schedule and therefore it is not so much their subject matter that I wish to discuss as the question of draftsmanship, in which, Mr. Blackburn, I am sure that you will be interested. It concerns the use of the term "Secretary of State". When this was used in another Bill ten days ago you, on the Floor of the House,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
expressed your concern in connection with that Bill, on the ground that the term "Secretary of State" did not define which Secretary of State. I raise the same point with regard to this Bin.<br><br>
You will remember that, on that occasion, we were told that the Secretary of State is one person whose job is divided between several persons and that each of these several persons can do the job of the others. That is the constitutional position. It brought to my mind the fact that, with this Schedule, we could have the Secretary of State for Education and Science interfering in Scottish affairs, and everyone knows that that would be completely disastrous and would not be tolerated in Scotland. The term "Secretary of State" should be qualified. We should indicate which Secretary of State.<br><br>
This is an important constitutional matter, as you will appreciate, having taken part in that previous discussion. When we raised this previously we were told that the common form in all Acts of Parliament was simply to state "Secretary of State". I searched through various Act and found this to be so. Yesterday, however, the Fishery Limits Bill was introduced for Second Reading and its definition Clause says that "Minister" means
<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State concerned with sea-fishing in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively."</p></blockquote>
That thus defines which Secretary of State is responsible in Scotland.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The point I raise now, since that prevision seems rather new, is that in the Fishery Limits Bill we are, for the first time, introducing words indicating which Secretary of State we mean by the term "Secretary of State". Should not the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) consider this in regard to this Bill, because there is no indication in it at present as to which Secretary of State he means? As the Bill is drafted at present, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Education and Science, or any other Secretary of State, could deal with this. As the Fishery Limits Bill defined which Secretary of State is responsible for those matters in Scotland, this Bill should do the same.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0622">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
I shall not waste much time on this point, but this is the first time it has been possible to raise the point in this Committee since the discussion to which I have referred took place on the Floor of the House. The promoter of the Bill should give us the benefit of his legal wisdom. I do not think he was in the House when the discussion to which I have referred took place. Unfortunately, he is not very often in the House when such matters are discussed, but this point occupied part of the time of the House. The point deserves some attention. I should like to know what the hon. Gentleman thinks about the use of these words in the Schedule and whether he thinks "Secretary of State" should be defined a little more clearly than it is at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Gordon Campbell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) invited me to comment on this, and I am very glad to do so. He also mentioned that my speeches in this Committee had so far been brief, a reputation which I am glad to have. I hope that I shall be able to preserve it, particularly as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) urged us to be brief and set an excellent example at our last Sitting. None the less, I shall try to answer as fully as I can the points which have been raised.<br><br>
First, I confirm as regards paragraph 4 what my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill said on the question of discount. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) appeared to agree with the explanation which was given about the tax implications. It raises a principle of taxation. That is why the Government should be brought in at that stage.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill explained that paragraph 5 of the Schedule brought in a question of general policy for the Government. I refer the Committee to the White Paper issued in October, 1963, Cmnd. 2162, which hon. Members will have read at the time, which pointed out how local authority borrowing can in various ways have an effect on the finance of the country as a whole and how the principles involved affect the central Government. Therefore, it seems wise that there should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
a reference to the Secretary of State and the Treasury in paragraph 5.<br><br>
The regulations will, as we see it, deal with such matters as the terms of issue and will also govern redemption. They will deal also with arrangements for transfer and questions of registration. For example, it may be desirable to have registers of bonds. We think that these points are the kind of points which are more suitably included in a Statutory Instrument which will come before Parliament in the usual way rather than that all these details should be placed in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill said that he understood, because in England the position is further ahead on this, that regulations were being drafted for England and Wales. I understand this is so. Those regulations will therefore, unless they get held up, which I imagine will not happen, be available for us to study before we in Scotland consider the same problems. I quickly say that there is no question of slavishly following the regulations made for England and Wales, but it is always helpful, when somebody else has been tackling a similar problem, if one studies what he is doing, and no doubt improve upon it. That would be our object, if possible. We may have slightly different problems to deal with. We shall study those regulations and then see how we can devise for Scotland regulations which will best deal with questions of issue, redemption, transfer and registration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we have a clear guarantee that these regulations will not be issued by the Secretary of State for Education and Science instead of by the Secretary of State for Scotland? This is the point I raised. I understand that it is possible under the Bill as at present drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the hon. Gentleman's point, but I can say here and now that he can be reassured that it would be the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am sure that my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill will be answering that point and generally considering whether any changes in drafting are required. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government's interpretation would be that it would be the Secretary of State for Scotland in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
these cases. Perhaps any examination of the drafting could best be dealt with by my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill.<br><br>
There will be no question of the regulations indicating what interest will be charged. They will deal with the general matters I have mentioned but not with the interest. We understand that the local authorities are keen to have this power. Some of them are looking forward to being able to issue bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that local authorities are looking forward to having this power. I appreciate that point, but he gave a clear indication that the regulations will deal only with matters of administration. Surely he will remember that his opening sentence was that the borrowing finance of the country was a matter in which the Treasury had an interest. I was thinking of this aspect. Will it be necessary for a local authority, before it issues any bonds, to seek the permission of the Secretary of State or the Treasury?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could qualify it by saying that, if enormous sums of money were involved, there might be a case for that, but in general for the amounts of money which are contemplated under the Bill for this purpose the Government would not seek to lay down rates of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not on the point of rates of interest. I am on the question whether a local authority will have the power to issue bonds. The hon. Gentleman indicated that the question of borrowing finance by local authorities or any other body concerned the Treasury. Naturally it would have an interest. What is in the hon. Gentleman's mind about that? Does it mean that the Treasury or the Secretary of State can say that a local authority will not be allowed in certain circumstances to issue bonds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to be able to explain that point. What I meant in my opening remarks was that the methods employed in doing that are a matter for the central Government. The methods to be used should not be too closely laid down, but some form should be indicated in the regulations—limits to what could be done—because of the country's financial policy as a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
whole. All of us can think of small burghs which might employ different methods without any effect on the national economy because of their size. If some unorthodox methods began to be widely adopted by some local authorities and then others caught on to the same thing, and if these for some reason changed the balance of payments, which the White Paper indicates can on some occasions be affected by short-term borrowing, then the principles involved in the methods would be a matter for the Government to know about. Here we have the suggestion that the principles and methods should be authorised by the Government and then within those the local authorities can take action.<br><br>
I was saying that we understand that some local authorities in Scotland are looking forward to the day when they can issue bonds on the lines of the provisions of the Bill. The Government intend to consult the local authority associations in the devising of the regulations. I assure hon. Members opposite that the views of the local authority associations will be taken into account in the process of formulating the regulations for Scotland. I hope that the answers I have given will be helpful to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have spoken of my knowledge of the issue by local authorities of housing bonds and how keen they are on issuing such bonds. These bonds have had a remarkable success in Scotland, as have municipal banks. The issue of housing bonds is a very simple procedure. Are there Regulations similar to those envisaged in the Bill dealing with housing bonds? Are there Regulations covering housing bonds such as the regulations provided for in paragraph 5 of the Schedule, under which the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury is necessary? If so, I have never heard of such Regulations.<br><br>
Scottish local authorities must have borrowed a huge amount over the past few years by means of housing bonds, usually at 5½ per cent. or 6 per cent., based on the Public Works Loan Board rate of interest. The wider local authority bond envisaged by the Bill may have several advantages. If it is adopted, am I correct in assuming that there will no longer be any need to issue housing bonds as such, because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
wider local authority bond would cover housing as one of the local authority's securities for borrowing money? The local authorities should be clear on this point. Would this mean that they would not necessarily need to issue individual bonds such as housing bonds? Would not the term "local authority bonds" include that as well as the other things envisaged by the promoter of the Bill?</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to be able to answer the hon. Member's question about housing bonds and the Regulations applying to them. They were made as long ago as 1926. I have a copy of them. They are rather hard to come by. After the title and interpretation, the Regulations refer to the issue of local bonds—there is a provision for the bonds to be issued at par, with interest—the form; the question of registration certificates; the transfer of local bonds; the closing of local bond registers; the transmission of local bonds, and the interest on them. Then there is a whole series of general points, and then a Schedule which lays down the form of the local housing bond and another Schedule which lays down the terms of the deed of transfer. I envisage that the regulations provided for in paragraph 5 of the present Schedule will be very similar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Were those Regulations issued by the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were issued by the Secretary of State in 1926, in the form of a Statutory Instrument. If the hon. Member wishes to acquaint himself more fully with them, the reference number is 1926. No. 540/S.25.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) raised a drafting point about the Secretary of State. I have always taken a great interest in this point since my schooldays. I often wondered why Scottish legislation always provided for things to be done by the Secretary of State without specifying him. In my study of constitutional law I was told that one Secretary of State could always act for another. In my later researches I found that the practice of referring merely to the Secretary of State in Scottish legislation was not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
invariable. Sometimes he was referred to specifically.<br><br>
While the hon. Member was raising the point I referred to the corresponding English Statute—the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1963—and I found that in the corresponding Section the Minister is defined as the Minister of Housing and Local Government. In England and Wales there does not seem to be any need for one Minister to substitute for another. I cannot see any reason why the Secretary of State should not be described as the Secretary of State for Scotland, but it has been the use and wont to refer purely to the Secretary of State. That is what I have done, and I suggest that the hon. Member may allow it to pass on this occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to pursue the matter. I accept the hon. Member's explanation. In fact, I am familiar with the situation. I have also looked up Acts of Parliament to see what form the references to the Minister took. What caused me to raise the matter was the Bill which we discussed yesterday, which deliberately refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State concerned with sea fishing in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
There can be only one Secretary of State concerned with sea fishing in Scotland, and that is the Secretary of State for Scotland—but he is specified in that Bill. The Bill introduced yesterday appeared to be a departure from our normal practice. No doubt, we can return to this question on future occasions in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this moment I do not want to join my hon. Friend in his "Stop Hogg" campaign, although I regard it as important as the "Stop Goldwater" campaign. I know my hon. Friend's enthusiasm and respect for constitutional interpretation. The obscurity of the recent variation has stemmed from the days when that former noble Lord became a Secretary of State and, indeed, with the help of the Prime Minister, obtained certain rights of interference in Scottish education.<br><br>
The Clause deals with the power to borrow by means of bonds. We are all glad that we now have before us a Measure which will give Scottish local authorities a new borrowing power,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
which should prove helpful. I understand from the hon. Member that local authorities are raring to go; they want this power and are anxious to use it. He had better tell them to hold their horses for a while. We are now told that the power to borrow by means of bonds, such as is envisaged here for Scotland, was granted to local authorities in England and Wales in a Bill last year, which went on to the Statute Book on 31st July, 1963. Nearly a year has passed since then and the relevant regulations are still not ready. It may be that the people in the chambers of St. Andrew's House will be much more expeditious. It may be that they will have before them regulations already drawn up by somebody else.<br><br>
We have had the assurance that there is no need for us slavishly to copy regulations from elsewhere. I have been over the Schedule very carefully, however, and I find that it is a pretty slavish copy of the words in the English Schedule, although it has managed to drop "Minister of Housing and Local Government" and to substitute "Secretary of State".<br><br>
The Clause has not been copied so slavishly, for fairly obvious reasons. Subsection (1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The means by which a local authority who are authorised to borrow money may raise that money shall, without prejudice to the exercise of any power"</p></blockquote>
that it already has
<br><blockquote><p>"include the issue of bonds … in accordance with the provisions of this Act."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions set out in the Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to local authority bonds."</p></blockquote>
We have then two further subsections. What do these say? Subsection (1) has already set out the means by which local authorities shall exercise any power to raise money. The exercise of any such power is obviously by a Statute, so by subsection (1) we have amended a Statute. Having done so, I cannot see why, in subsection (3) the Bill goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"In accordance with the provisions of this section, section 260(1) of the Local Government (Scotland), Act 1947 shall be amended. …"</p></blockquote>
We have just done that, by implication. It may be that this is a matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
of clarity—an endeavour to spell out the provision very clearly—but subsection (3) does not provide the power to borrow by means of bonds; it is merely an amendment of a previous Act of Parliament. It may be that, if this is to be in the Bill at all, it is not in its right place.<br><br>
The only thing which could have been amended was Section 260 (1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947. Having said that once, by implication, we proceed to say it a second time. We say that in accordance with the provisions of this Section, that Act
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be amended by the insertion … of the words' or (f) by the issue of bonds in accordance with section 7 of the Local Government (Development and Finance) (Scotland) Act 1964'."</p></blockquote>
Then we go on to subsection (4) which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In any enactment passed before this Act"—</p></blockquote>
and I suppose that that includes the Act of 1947—
<br><blockquote><p>"a reference to Part XII or section 260 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 shall be construed as including a reference to the foregoing provisions of this section."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it shall be construed as including a power to raise money by bonds. Having said it once, it says it twice, and then three times over. I would not have said that this was worthy of ten out of ten for draftsmanship. The English Statute from which this is lifted managed to deal with the point in a much quicker way.<br><br>
Let us go on to the Schedule, which is the meat of the matter. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) that although it appears that local authorities are being given pretty clear powers, in that the Schedule provides that the interest that the bonds are to bear shall be
<br><blockquote><p>"at such rate as the local authority may determine at the time of the issue of the bonds"</p></blockquote>
and also that they are to be issued in denominations of £5, and for periods of not less than one year, in paragraph 5 there is an entirely different picture. That paragraph clearly places complete control with the Secretary of State. I am not arguing against that; I do not say that it is wrong; but hitherto we have tended to mislead local authorities in respect of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
their freedom to issue these bonds. Paragraph 5 provides that local authority bonds
<br><blockquote><p>"shall … be issued, transferred, dealt with and redeemed upon such terms and in accordance with such provisions as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? It goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
The Treasury is brought in because of our general economic policy and the effect which an accumulation of local authority borrowings could have upon our general financial position.<br><br>
The fact is that the Secretary of State determines how the bonds shall be issued. Does his power include a decision whether or not bonds shall be issued at all? Will it be within his power, with the approval of the Treasury, to suspend the use of this provision? Will this be part of the regulations? If the Secretary of State has control, and if that control is so important from the point of view of the country's general financial position, will there be power for him to suspend the use of these bonds altogether? I envisage the regulations as being in general terms, automatically applying to any local authority which wants to issue bonds. If the control of the economy is to be maintained in respect of these bonds, is there a point at which the Secretary of State or the Treasury can say "Stop. There are far too many"? Will the Treasury say, "You will overturn the money market and affect the economic future of the country"?<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If both hon. Members mean what they say—and their words were clear in that the general and financial policies of the Government were so affected by this matter that it was mentioned in October, 1963, after the English Bill and the White Paper—then we need some clarification. The Government have hitherto interfered with the methods of local authority borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board; they ensured that there was a considerable reduction in borrowing from that source and directed local authorities to borrow elsewhere. In this case we are dealing with something more general than a single housing loan, for these bonds will cover wide local authority borrowing and work. Will there be within the regulations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
a general power to the Secretary of State and the Treasury to amend and to withdraw, it may be for a time, the use of this valuable power by the local authorities? That is implicit not so much in the Bill as in the explanations which have been given by both hon. Members.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) spoke of routine matters, and no doubt we shall have these rather more routine regulations, but the important point here is that the regulations are subject to annulment. Usually, if Statutory Instruments relate purely to routine matters, they are not subject to annulment. I refer to such matters as how the form is to be filled in and questions of transfer. These are routine matters and not matters of high policy. Within paragraph 5 there must be something which is important policy in view of the fact that the regulations are to be subject to annulment by either House. I want to know what it is. I hope that the hon. Member will not think me too pernickety in suggesting that because they are subject to annulment they must involve some important matters which the House of Commons wants to keep within its control.<br><br>
Are these bonds to be related to the general work of the local authority or is their issue to be related to specific aspects? We have had reference to the usefulness of the housing bonds. Will these bonds be issued for housing purposes? Will there be bonds issued for playingfields? Or will there be general bonds? If they are general bonds, will there be any limit to the amount which can be borrowed by local authorities in respect of these general issues, and if there are limits, what are they likely to be? The Under-Secretary of State referred to this point in his rather longer speech this morning: He must have read his brief this morning. Is the question of interest rates to be included? One hon. Member was horrified at the idea that the Government would suggest the interest rates, but that is not the attitude adopted on an earlier Clause when advances by local authorities had to be at a rate of interest the lower limit of which was specified. Is the same principle to be followed in respect of this provision? How quickly does the hon. Member hope to bring the regulations forward?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
Will he wait till the rather more lackadaisical equivalent of St. Andrew's House in the Department of Housing and Local Government gets down to the regulations or will he get the approval of the Treasury speedily and present us with the regulations fairly soon, possibly within the next fortnight or so, since we have been told about the anxiety with which the local authorities are awaiting this power?<br><br>
I am not entirely satisfied, moreover, that, the hon. Member's explanation of paragraph 4 is necessarily correct. He spoke about the tax implications of local authorities issuing bonds at a discount. When a local authority in Scotland issues stocks at a discount, must it obtain the Secretary of State's consent? If tax concessions arise, we might as well have the overriding approval of the Treasury, too. He adduces tax implications as a reason for paragraph 4, yet there is no mention of the Treasury. Tax implications? I do not believe it. He rightly said that if one issues stocks or bonds at a discount it gives certain benefits to the person who purchases them, and it is only right that the Treasury should come in. He has been to great pains to show that no great sums of money are involved, and he spoke of the kind of sums involved, implying that they would be relatively small. May I ask whether the greater amount of stocks issued at a discount in this country in the money market are subject to the approval of the Treasury or of any Secretary of State? If the provision is not necessary in that case, he must find some greater justification for applying it only to local authorities and only to local authorities in respect of local authority bonds.<br><br>
I do not claim to be an expert in these matters of high finance and low finance, but I can recognise a false argument when I see it, and I am not entirely satisfied with the argument advanced on paragraph 4 in regard to tax implications. This was the reason, the hon. Member said, why the Secretary of State must give his consent before a local authority may issue these bonds at a discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient for me to reply to one or two points affecting the Government, and raised by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), before my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) replies to the other points.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
I am glad to be able to say that if the Bill is enacted this summer we hope to have the regulations completed in the autumn, which would be much quicker than the hon. Member for Kilmarnock suggested. We should not wait for the English and Welsh regulations, should they be held up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When in the autumn does the hon. Member hope to give the House of Commons an opportunity of taking advantage of the provisions of paragraph 5(2)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the work of preparing the regulations. We hope that they would be ready in the autumn. We also know that other political events are due to happen in this country at that time. We expect the regulations to be ready for action by the new Parliament. The hon. Member was asking when the Government would have carried out their work of drafting and consultation with local authority associations, and that is how we forecast it.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Member asked whether these regulations would contain some much more extreme provision than that which I have indicated such as to have the effect of suspending the issue of bonds. I assure him that the regulations would govern the conditions of issue and the general handling and treatment of these bonds but would not contain a measure to enable the Secretary of State to bring the issue of the bonds to an end or to suspend it.<br><br>
He asked about the regulations nevertheless being in a Statutory Instrument which would be subject to annulment. I indicated earlier that there had been criticism from an hon. Member opposite that all these provisions were not in the Bill, and I indicated that these detailed provisions seemed much more suitable for regulations. In order to give Parliament a chance, nevertheless, of seeing them, they are to be included in a Statutory Instrument subject to annulment. That is the reason, not that there will be some sinister power given to the Secretary of State in the regulations.<br><br>
He asked whether the bonds would be of a general nature or tied to particular subjects with which local authorities deal. It is contemplated by the Government that they would be of a general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
nature. The housing bonds were tied to housing, but the intention, as the Government see it—my mon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West will expand further on this matter—is that they would be of a general nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that after the Bill is passed there will be no further need for housing bonds? Will they be tied to certain local authority securities? I take it that there would be a total value up to which local authorities could borrow—or would there be an unlimited value?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will deal with that point. I was dealing with it as the Government see it. My understanding is that the housing bonds would continue but that the other bonds would be additional and of a general nature.<br><br>
I can only repeat what I said earlier about the tax implications: this is simply a straightforward question of control in case some highly unorthodox proposal were made. I agree with the hon. Member for Kilmarnock that we should not expect local authorities to issue these bonds at a great discount. Neverthless, where there are matters of taxation and the possibility of a person buying up large quantities in order to get an absolutely safe capital gain I think the hon. Member agrees that this is a matter for a general background control, which is suggested, by the central Government. That is all that is intended. I am not suggesting that there is a possibility that something like this would happen, but it is the possibility of extremely strange things happening in these matters which requires a general control of this nature.<br><br>
I think that I have answered all the questions which the hon. Member asked.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will be aware of one convener of a county in Scotland who was so exercised and enraged by the Government's activities in cutting down the amount he felt necessary in respect of education that he threatened to run a sweepstake—assuming that the only way people can get money in this country is by gambling. Would there be anything in the regulations to prevent a local authority issuing a local form of Premium Bond; that is, a bond without interest, and more or less
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
on the basis of what the Government themselves have done through the Post Office? Would there be anything within the regulations to prevent that kind of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to answer off the cuff about regulations which have not yet been drafted. Nevertheless the hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point, which we will consider. If I can give an answer in the course of these proceedings I will, but it might be one of those things which will have to be looked at to see whether or not it would be allowed. I thank the hon. Gentleman for making an interesting suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We look at it, not from the point of restricting local authorities, but of giving them full freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has not answered all the points raised by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), and it might complete the picture if I were to do so now.<br><br>
The hon. Member suggested that subsection (3) is unnecessary to a large extent, or possibly entirely, as the point is covered by subsection (1). I suggest that, even if that were so, it would be convenient to keep the subsection, because my experience of the legal profession tells me that as soon as this Bill becomes law every town clerk who is concerned with these matters will immediately produce his copy of the 1947 Act, turn up Section 260, and very conveniently write in a sub-paragraph (<i>f</i>), so that the 1947 Act, as amended, will become a code to which he can conveniently refer. For that reason alone I think that it is worth while retaining the subsection.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that subsection (4) did no more, once again, than repeat subsection (3)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I said that subsection (4) included subsection (3), not that it did exactly the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have been inaccurate in my use of words.<br><br>
At any rate, I suggest that subsection (4) does a great deal more than that, because its effect is to extend the power of borrowing by means of bonds to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
joint committees of water boards and various bodies like that which are generally set up under Private legislation. If the subsection were excluded, the Clause would not apply to joint committees of that kind, which would be prevented from borrowing by means of bonds. Therefore, quite apare from subsections (3) and (1), subsection (4) has value.<br><br>
More than one hon. Member has asked whether the issue of bonds would be subject to any limit. This Bill does not form any new principle relating to the limitation on borrowing by local authorities, nor does it give the local authorities any new power to borrow. The general law of borrowing will be as it is now. All we are doing is to provide a new form of borrowing, so no limit is being applied to the amount which may be borrowed by means of bonds. Therefore, quite apart from sub-existing forms.<br><br>
Now we come to the interesting point about discounts—.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there will be no limit to the actual amount which will be borrowed. Do I take it that if the valuation of a burgh were £1 million the local authority could say, borrow £1,500,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member will appreciate that there are various limitations on local borrowing at the moment. Those limitations will not be affected in any way by this Bill, which purely provides a new form of borrowing.<br><br>
Before turning to discounts I must answer the question put by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) about how far housing bonds will be replaced by these bonds. As these housing bonds fall to be repaid they will probably not be renewed in that form. I think that town chamberlains will find it much more convenient to use the new form of bond which will be available to replace the old housing bond. They will probably find it convienient in future to use only one form of bond. But the housing bonds will I think, still continue in a great many instances for a great many years. I understand that the total amount of housing bonds at present in issue in Scot-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
land is about £100 million. I also understand that the total amount of local authority borrowing in Scotland is about ten times that sum, so that these bonds will have a great deal of use for housing purposes.<br><br>
I pass now to the subject of discounts. The tax implications here are extremely important. I cannot see any reason, other than a moral one, why a local authority should not issue bonds at a discount of, say, 20 per cent.—issue £100 bonds at £80—repayable over five years. The effect of that would be to give a tax-free interest of no less than 4 per cent.—.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has no evidence for that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have not any evidence. It does not require evidence. Any local authority might be attracted to do this. It would obviously be a very attractive thing to a financier to lend money to a local authority at a discount in anticipation of a tax-free profit. The local authority might very well say, if it felt so inclined, "All right, we will give you £100 for £80, but we will only pay interest of 2 per cent." That might be morally reprehensible but, apart from morals, there is nothing to prevent a local authority from doing that, except the sort of restriction envisaged in the Schedule. With all discounts there is a very distinct possibility of bonds being abused in that way, and paragraph 4 will serve, or may serve, or could serve a very useful purpose in that respect.</span></p>

—(DISCOUNT ON RATES.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 12, to leave out "two and one half" and to insert "three and three quarters".<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Gourlay) was to have moved this Amendment, Mr. Blackburn, but he is unavoidably engaged elsewhere, and has asked me to apologise to the Committee for his absence.<br><br>
Behind subsection (1) is the idea that there will be an advantage to local authorities in getting in the rates earlier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
than the closing date. I know from my own experience in local authority work that it is of very great advantage to town chamberlains or county treasurers to get in the money before the last day. Some people certainly wait till the last minute before paying, but others are very keen to make their payment. If everyone were keen it would pay very great dividends to local authorities, because very often, whether they like it or not, towards the end of the financial year local authorities have to borrow on overdraft—usually from the local banks in the case of small burghs—and at an enhanced rate of interest. The hon. Gentleman proposes to give an inducement, so that if people pay their rates by a certain date—to be laid down, I suppose, by the local authority—they will be given a discount.<br><br>
Discount comes into our discussion again, although I do not think that it is a capital gain, and not as reprehensible as the hon. Gentleman indicated many of the present practices are. This is a discount on rates paid by a certain date, and the hon. Gentleman suggests that it should be of 2½ per cent., or 6d. in the £.<br><br>
We, on this side, doubt whether that is a sufficient inducement. With the falling value of the £, 6d. is about in the realm of what the bawbee was worth in our youth. We therefore suggest a discount of 3¾ per cent. Even that percentage is not great, but it is half as much again as that proposed—9d. in the £.<br><br>
There is a great deal of good in the idea embodied in this Clause, and we want to make it successful, but I am sure that it would have much more chance of success if the discount were 9d. in the £ instead of 6d. in the £.<br><br>
I do not think that there is any danger at all in the hon. Member adopting the our suggestion, because before this scheme could come into operation it would need the passing of a resolution in full council. If the council did not want to use it, there would be no need for it to pass the resolution. Or it could decide that the rate should be 2½ per cent. The Clause says that the discount cannot exceed 2½ per cent., or 6d. in the £, but we would rather say that it cannot exceed 9d. in the £. If local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
authorities then decided on 2½ per cent., good enough, but the more progressive of them might say that it should be 3¾ per cent. in order to get in the rates as early as possible, and so avoid the need for an overdraft to carry on the work till the rates began to come in again. Local authorities will be able to work out quite accurately the saving to them on the assumption of their not having to pay excess interest on overdrafts. There is no risk in our suggestion at all, because the whole matter will be in the control of the local authority, by resolution of the full council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument seems very simple. It is that the local authority will itself save money and should pass on as much as possible of that saving to the people who help it to save the money. There is also the fact that the higher rate of interest might induce more people to pay early.<br><br>
Edinburgh has operated this scheme for a few years now—I think, although I am not certain, that it is the only local authority in Scotland operating such a scheme—but what the results have been I do not know. Has the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) made inquiries about that? This has been done in Edinburgh for a few years and the results should be well known.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
It does not make any difference to me, as an Edinburgh ratepayer. I am afraid that I still pay my rates very late—perhaps because I have not a highly developed sense of business acumen, but on the occasions when I have worked the thing out to see whether I should pay them earlier I have concluded that I would gain nothing by doing so. Many ratepayers must be in the same position.<br><br>
They may save in a savings bank or the Post Office in order to pay their rates. If they gain nothing by removing their money from the savings bank or Post Office and paying their rates early they are not likely to be influenced by these provisions. Quite a number of institutions in which people save pay 2½ per cent. interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very good and helpful argument, and the 2½ per cent. interest rate also applies to the Post Office Savings Bank.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And also to the cooperative societies. Those who leave their dividend draw the same rate of interest. A savings bank may pay more, in which case there will be less incentive.<br><br>
For all these reasons, it seems debatable as to which is the better bargain—the proposal in this Clause or the rate of interest in a savings bank or Post Office. I believe that the Edinburgh scheme has met with some success, but to what extent I do not know. It would help us make up our minds if we were told. On the face of it, the Amendment seems desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know into which category I fall. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) says he is keen to pay his rates. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is reluctant to pay his. I pay my rates in two instalments.<br><br>
I am interested in the idea incorporated in this Clause. Naturally, if one is urged to pay one's rates early one calculates what advantage there will be. A great deal depends on whether payment at that time will mean an overdraft or whether one has to take the money from savings. A rate of 2½ per cent. will surely give the local authorities little leeway to decide whether this scheme is useful or not.<br><br>
Surely there would be no objection to putting in the higher figure proposed in the Amendment, for then the local authorities would be able to decide on the basis of knowledge of how this works. Two figures might be used. For instance, if the total amount is paid when the rates notice is issued—say, within seven days—the ratepayer may get the benefit of 3¾ per cent. If he pays within a month, the lower figure suggested in the Clause might obtain. Ft would surely be wise to include the higher figure to enable local authorities to experiment a little. I am sure that Scottish local authorities will be realistic about this power and will not wish to pass any resolution which will mean losing money. We could safely leave it to their good sense to decide, on the basis of their professional advice, what is best.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) put his ringer on the point. At what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
point does it pay a local authority to give a discount? The corollary of that is: at what point does it pay a ratepayer to pay rates in advance? Hon. Members have spoken about 2½ per cent. being equivalent to the Post Office rate of interest. That is not really so. We are not speaking about annual interest but discount in respect of payment over a comparatively short period.<br><br>
Edinburgh Corporation gives 1¾ per cent. discount if one pays the rates by 28th November. It brings in about one-third of the rates by that date. The remainder drag on till the end of February, when the local authority takes firm steps. It is not a matter of 1¾ per cent. per annum. It applies for three months and is therefore equivalent to 5 per cent. per annum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how this operates. I have calculated my rates, however, and my figures do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked if I had made inquiries in Edinburgh. I have done so, and am giving the results of my researches. The discount is 1¾ per cent. over three months. If one multiplies that, one reaches 5 per cent. per annum. The result is that Edinburgh Corporation saves money through not paying so much in overdraft rates. If the Corporation paid more than 1¾ per cent. it would probably be a net loser.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) suggested a higher discount for a longer period. It is a feasible and proper proposition, but I cannot see a local authority giving a discount for a much longer period than, say, six months at the outside. It is usually the late summer or early autumn before the amount of the rates is known, so it would not be practical for a local authority to issue a rates notice till the end of September or some such date. The rate of 2½ per cent. over six months would in any case still give the figure of 5 per cent. per annum, which is the rate to which Edinburgh Corporation works now. Looking at the picture all round, I think that 2½ per cent. is probably about right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member is doing his sums wrong. He talked about 24½ per cent. for six months. This is a rate of 5 per cent. per annum. Suppose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
I decide to pay my rates three months early but have to draw the money from where it is invested at 2½ per cent. per annum. I am, in effect, getting the same rate of interest as I would get if I left the money in the savings bank. But, in the end, one still loses, for one is reducing one's total account in the savings bank, on which interest is paid. In other words, if one has £100 in the bank at 2½ per cent. and one removes £20, one is losing 10s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. On that £100 of savings he is getting only 2½ per cent. per annum. In other words, he has to have his money in for a year before he gets £2 10s. If he gets a discount of 2½ per cent. from the local authorities for six months he is getting the equivalent of 5 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that rate—yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we do not want the local authorities to be net losers in this but net gainers. Therefore, the amount of discount translated into interest per annum must be lower than what they pay to the banks by way of overdraft, and I suggest that 2½ per cer. over six months is about right because that produces an annual rate of 5 per cent.<br><br>
I think there is danger in the Amendment. If we made the rate 3¾ per cent. a great deal of undue influence might be brought to bear on local authorities by large ratepayers with large capital resources in order to get this 3¾ per cent., and the local authorities, would in the long run, be net losers. And that, of course, includes the ordinary ratepayers. I suggest that 2½ per cent. is about right, having regard to all the circumstances, but there is another consideration. Getting a very attractive discount would be giving a favour to people in a position to pay their rates in advance, and the ordinary humble ratepayer who has to scrape and save to pay his rates—many of us are in that position—would be at a disadvantage compared with his richer neighbour. I suggest that the Clause be left as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult thing on which to make up one's mind. What makes it difficult is that we stipulate 2½ per cent. but not time. A local authority can vary the value of 24 per cent. by stipulating the date by which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
full amount has to be paid. Edinburgh has fixed the date of 28th November. It would have made a better bargain if it had changed the date to a much shorter period. A local authority could manipulate the date to make a better bargain for the ratepayers or for itself. This is a difficult problem. I do not think anything would have been lost by accepting the Amendment. On the other hand, I am not sure whether there would be any real value, unless we were able to stipulate a date to enable us to calculate the advtanges one way or another.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the hon. Member explain the effect of a large ratepayer. The inference is that a large ratepayer would be able to influence his local authority to select a higher rate of interest and a date suitable to his own position. The local authorities I know would not tend to be influenced in that way in deciding what discount or date should apply.<br><br>
The hon. Member also spoke of poor persons like himself and me. One hon. Member has said that he is keen to pay his rates, another is unwilling, and another reluctant. My question is whether I am able to pay. I remember advice my father gave me. He served a long time on a local authority. Among the other members of the authority was a man who was probably the richest person in Ayr. This gentleman paid his rates on the very last day, and my father said, "If it is good enough for him it is good enough for me."<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman spoke, I immediately thought of those in local authority houses who pay their rates with the rent. They do not wait till the last day. When the last day comes they have already paid 11 months of their rates. They get no discount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will get some.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. It is not a question of how much they pay beforehand. It is a question whether the net amount is paid on a certain date. They must pay the whole amount on a certain date.<br><br>
I was interested in the scheme being worked by Edinburgh. Many local authorities are working similar schemes of payment by instalments. This is more or less for the convenience of ratepayers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
who have many other things to do around the time the rate demand is received. All ratepayers are not aware that they can wait till a very late date before they pay any attention at all to the hurried note that comes from the offices of the chamberlain saying that the dates are due.<br><br>
It may well be true that it may be an advantage for local authorities. I can see that it would tend to be an advantage only for large local authorities and not to the same extent for smaller local authorities. It is a moot point whether there is any advantage in the Amendment as against the power of local authorities to manipulate the terms which are already in being. It may well be I should not have opened my mouth about this, because the hon. Gentleman will probably now proceed to amend his legis lation to limit the discretion he has unknowingly given local authorities.</span></p>

—(POWER TO AMEND LOCAL ACTS.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the first two Amendments conveniently go together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 27, to leave out from the beginning to the second "the".<br><br>
My second Amendment, in page 6, line 33, seeks to insert these words:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The Secretary of State shall not make an order under this section repealing or amending any provision in a local Act. the Bill for which was promoted by a local authority or by any body whose functions under the local Act have become exercisable by a local authority, except on the application of that local authority."</p></blockquote>
The main part of the Amendments is contained in the last words of the second Amendment, namely
<br><blockquote><p>"except on the application of that local authority."</p></blockquote>
The implication is that the power to amend Local Acts by the Secretary of State is exercisable, as the Bill stands at present, on the application of any local authority and not of the particular local authority which promoted the local Bill or by any body whose functions under the Local Act have become exercisable by a local authority.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
That is the main purpose of the Bill. There is no secret about it. These are the exact words of the Statute from which the hon. Gentleman lifted the main parts of the Bill. I want to know why he did not lift the words which are there but preferred words which are, to my mind, very much looser, and give a power of interference by one local authority in the affairs of another local authority. That is the meaning of the words in the Bill. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman intended that, but there must be some reason why he departed from the English Statute and used these words in applying the Secretary of State's powers to amend Local Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) is very hard to please. At one moment he berates me for copying slavishly an English Statute. Then, when I use a little initiative and depart from the verbiage of an English Statute, the hon. Gentleman takes me to task for having done so. The Amendment follows exactly Section 12(2) of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1963. I studied that when I drafted the Bill, but decided that there was a great deal of unnecessary verbiage in it. I altered the wording of the English Statute purely for the purpose of avoiding that verbiage. If the hon. Gentleman feels strongly that the English verbiage is better than my short and terse drafting, I am prepared to look at this again, but I hope that, for the sake of brevity, the hon. Gentleman will not press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at my hon. Friend having copied the English version. I see the point he is getting at, that it makes for clarity that the application should be made only by the local authority concerned. However, it is very unlikely that Edinburgh Corporation will apply to the Secretary of State to repeal a provisional order that Glasgow has had passed. My hon. Friend may have in mind that a county council might wish to have something annulled which a burgh within the county has managed to get through. If so, my hon. Friend is right, but it is highly unlikely that one local authority would try to have the powers of another local authority removed. Therefore, I cannot see
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
why my hon. Friend has tabled the Amendments.<br><br>
I would not argue at great length over this, but I feel inclined to support the promoter of the Bill in having departed from the English phraseology. It is not a bad thing to omit a little verbiage when its omission will do no harm, especially as we are dealing with local Statutes which have become inconsistent or unnecessary as the result of the Bill. Therefore, there is not much at stake. If the local Statutes have become unnecessary or inconsistent in consequence of the Bill, it does not matter a great deal if a county authority applies to have something relating to a burgh within the county annulled. The county council might be saving the burgh council a certain amount of research and in that way saving it expenditure. As we are dealing with local legislation, this is a quarrel about something which is very small, and in these circumstances I am prepared to support the promoter of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps 1 may answer the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) about a local authority. In that case, subsection (2) would come into operation and the Secretary of State would have a duty to consult the local authority concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Until my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) mentioned this, I am sure that the promoter of the Bill had never thought of this advantage that he had written into the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he decided on the change to save words. He will have me with him every time on that, but when one sets out to save words one thing one must be careful about is not to change the meaning. Whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not, that is exactly what he has done. My Amendment would provide that the Secretary of State cannot promote an order, in relation to the repeal of out-of-date legislation, unless the local authority which promoted that legislation asks him to do so. If that legislation affects any other local authority, before the order is made the Secretary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
of State would consult that other local authority. This is fair. What is quite wrong is to give the initiating power to one local authority—this is what is implicit in the Clause as it is drafted—to ask the Secretary of State to repeal a provision which was promoted by another local authority.<br><br>
Then the safeguard is that, before the Secretary of State does so, he shall very kindly, if he thinks fit, consult:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before making an order under this section the Secretary of State shall consult with any local authority appearing to him to be concerned …"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Shall" consult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but only after he has made up his mind that it is concerned. The Secretary of State is entirely covered. He can do what he likes.<br><br>
Then these words appear:
<br><blockquote><p>"…not being a local authority by whom an application for the making of the order was made."</p></blockquote>
This is going a bit far. I am sure that it was not the intention of the hon. Gentleman to have that. He would have been far better, if he intended to shorten the wording to have conserved the original sense of it. All I am concerned about is to conserve the original sense, which I think was right, and that, by shortening it, we do not pass the initiative from the local authority which is rightly concerned to another authority which may be only incidentally concerned, or, indeed, not concerned at all, but which is merely drawing the attention of the Secretary of State to it.<br><br>
It is not a terribly important issue, but from the point of view of one local authority interfering with another local authority it could well be construed as an issue. Does any hon. Gentleman think that a small Scottish burgh looks kindly upon a county council which reports it to the Secretary of State for Scotland and asks him to repeal some legislation which it has promoted? There is a question of principle involved. It is on the question of principle that the hon. Gentleman has failed. He would be far better to return, if not to the original words, to the original sense of the Statute which was the quarry from which he mined the Clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made the position quite clear. Subsection (2) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"Before making an order … the Secretary of State shall consult with any local authority … not being a local authority by whom an application for the making of the order was made."</p></blockquote>
If this is necessary at all it would be far better to provide that the Secretary of State should also consult the local authority making the application. It would be very wrong if that local authority should not be right in on any such consultations which the Secretary of State might have with another local authority, which was merely incidentally concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point raised by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) about the initiative passing to some other local authority. I should like to think about this matter between now and Report. I suggest that it would be a comparatively simple matter to amend subsection (1) and still to avoid the verbiage of the English Act. In the circumstances, I hope that the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be quite prepared to put forward a simple manuscript Amendment to enable the hon. Member to do this, but it is his Bill and not mine. I thought that I would draw his attention to the departure from the original sense.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, to leave out line 44 and to add "the House of Commons".<br><br>
I should like to apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) who intended to move the Amendment.<br><br>
This subject has been debated on many occasions in Standing Committee, and my hon. Friends and I have always objected to the fact that a Statutory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
Instrument is subject to annulment in pursuant of a resolution of either House of Parliament. We would much prefer that it should be so subject to the House of Commons alone. We do not like the possibility of another place being able to do this without consultation with the House of Commons. I hope that the hon. Member will view the point favourably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) will remember that the House of Commons is given sole jurisdiction in matters of this sort only where financial implications are involved. Here we are giving the Secretary of State powers to repeal legislation which has become redundant, and when legislation has been passed not by the House of Commons alone but by both Houses it seems proper that both Houses shall be consulted before such legislation is repealed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Member is himself suggesting an Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that he was suggesting that the provision should refer to "both Houses of Parliament" instead of "either House of Parliament". That is what he said. I take it that that is what he means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean that at all. Either House of Parliament could pass a resolution annulling a Statutory instrument.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have looked through the Bill in respect of the powers it gives to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
local authorities and also at the new Clauses which the hon. Member proposes to introduce, and I find that the definition of a local authority appears to be different in each. In the interpretation Clause "local authority" means:
<br><blockquote><p>"a county council or town council"</p></blockquote>
The new Clauses, however, indicate that a local authority includes a district council. Perhaps the hon. Member can explain why there appears to be this difference.<br><br>
The powers of a district council are those given it by its county council, but many progressive district councils would like to do many other things. We have heard a great deal about district councils building swimming pools, but a district council is not permitted to borrow money by issuing bonds. This would be a very useful power. Will the hon. Member indicate whether, at a later stage, he intends to include district councils in this definition, and give them power for these purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend. I hope that the hon. Member intends to include district councils. I speak with considerable feeling on the district council question, especially when it arises in areas like mine, where often a district council is the only local body of any kind for many miles, and is very far from the county council seat. Such a district council is compelled to consider many matters which in other cases would be first considered by county councils.<br><br>
Very often a county council asks such a district council specifically to consider a certain matter and to give the county council guidance. In many cases the view of the district council is immediately accepted. In other words, a considerable amount of authority is given to district councils to deal with quite important problems, simply because of the factor of distance and remoteness from the county council seat. It is important that county councils should have the views of the district councils within their areas. At the same time, it is not always possible for a district council to be available in respect of questions which directly affect its area but which come under the authority of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
the county council. In areas like mine—and especially in island areas like mine—the opinion of district councils is important. I want to see the delegation of more functions and authority to district councils.<br><br>
I welcome what the new Clauses will do; indeed, I very much welcome the greater part of the Bill. Later, the new Clauses seek to extend some of the present provisions, but at this point I am a little worried. I see that in the new Clauses district councils are included in the definition of local authorities. Can the hon. Member tell us what his intention is, and how it will be implemented, if he does want to include district councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee know that I am extremely interested in district councils and have fought for them on many occasions. I have tried to give them the status of local authorities wherever possible. I have given much thought to the question how far they can be properly brought into the Bill. We had a debate on this matter at an earlier stage, when, with great regret, I came to the conclusion that in many cases it would not be proper for district councils to have powers to set up funds referred to in that part of the Bill.<br><br>
The difficulty is that district councils vary widely throughout Scotland, not only in their composition but in respect of the powers given to them by their county councils. They also vary from large districts, as in the case of Lanarkshire, with populations of over 60,009, down to districts with very small populations of only a few hundreds. Financial resources and the ability to handle capital assets also vary very widely. Furthermore, in some cases there is a full-time staff which is just as capable to look after capital funds as are the staffs of town and county councils, but in many other Scottish districts the district councils are run on a part-time basis, by a county council official or a person who does the job in his spare time.<br><br>
It is very difficult to legislate for such a variety of local authorities as that. It was with great regret I came to the conclusion that district councils could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
not properly be treated as local authorities in respect of the earlier provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
Although some district councils are very progressive, generally speaking they are very conservative in their expenditure. I have made inquiries in my county and find that one of its largest and most progressive district councils rates only at 1d. in the £. In such a case there is little need for a capital fund. Generally speaking, they get as much capital as they require fairly easily from their county councils.<br><br>
The question of the issuing of local bonds by district councils was also raised. I have not considered the point in detail, because district councils have made no approach to me on the point. There may be some substance in the point, and I should like to examine it more thoroughly. We still have a good bit of the Bill to consider, and in the new Clauses to which we are about to pass district councils are regarded as local authorities. I should like to give further thought to the whole question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it is before we pass to the next stage that the problem arises, because—without wishing to discuss in detail what we are going to take next—we are then going to deal with the problem of the additional power to develop land. This power to develop land arises in Clause 4. Surely the hon. Member knows that district councils are not included in Clause 4 whereas they are included in the new Clause.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
If we pass this stage without some indication of what is involved, it will be too late. I can visualise the circumstances. A district council in my area, the Vale of Leven District Council, which is a progressive authority, might wish to acquire a piece of land bordering Loch Lomond, and the new Clause would give that district council the power to do all these things to preserve or enhance the natural beauty of the land; but the district council would not be permitted to develop and erect buildings under Clause 4.<br><br>
This is the odd thing which we are doing and that is why it seems to me that the hon. Member has looked at the Bill as it stands, has decided not to include district councils, and then has put down
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
a new Clause, involving expenditure, in which he has included district councils. If he is to be consistent he ought to give district councils the power given in Clause 4, to enable them to improve the area and to erect buildings, and to borrow money with which to do so, as well as imposing on them the obligations which he intends to impose in the first new Clause to spend money on clearing places up.<br><br>
The Amendment down to the new Clause will enable district councils to put in piers, jetties, boatslips and so on. Here, again, it is surely necessary to include the district councils in Clause 4 to give them the power to erect buildings to protect the boats which are using the boatslips. Will the hon. Member give us some indication of what he intends?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that this is purely a matter of degree. District councils already have various powers under various Statutes with which hon. Members opposite are as familiar as I am. In the Bill, we are seeking to confer new powers on local authorities in addition to those which they already possess. We debated Clause 4 and the related Clauses 5 and 6 at considerable length, and most of the discussion took place along the lines of the provision of industry and factories. Which is the correct local authority to do this is a matter of degree. When we are giving powers of that magnitude to a local authority, I feel that it ought to be a major local authority with a highly organised staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the activities of the local authority in that case are not limited to major undertakings but might well include undertakings such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele)—for example, boat sheds. In later Clauses we deal with shelters for humans. In this case one might erect shelters for boats, possibly in association with the now famous swimming pool or a boating enterprise. Everything need not be a major undertaking. We are not asking that the authority should always undertake enterprises on an industrial scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is as may be, but it is a matter of degree. If hon. Members consider that district councils
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
should be given power to erect more modest buildings of the type indicated, there is no reason why they should not have put down an Amendment to that effect.<br><br>
I feel with great sorrow that Clauses 4, 5 and 6 are rather too wide in scope to apply to such minor local authorities as many of the district councils are. On the other hand, when we are considering the type of development envisaged in the first new Clause a district council is a very suitable local authority for this development. There are already a number of Amendments to that Clause, and there is no reason why there should not be more, but I feel that, in the circumstances, Clauses 4, 5 and 6 should be confined to town and county councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Reading the new Clause and the Bill, one feels that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is involved in somewhat of a contradiction. The first new Clause is very similar to Clause 4(1). In parts the words are similar—
<br><blockquote><p>"carry out such work as appears to them to be expedient"</p></blockquote>
for the purpose of improving the land or preserving or enhancing it. But in one case the definition of local authority excludes district councils and in the other case it includes them. This is a bit of a hotchpotch. I should find it difficult to disentangle one from the other and to say that county councils and burgh councils, large and small, will be responsible in the one case but that in the other case district councils can also accept some responsibility.<br><br>
It is difficult to differentiate between Clause 4(1) and the first new Clause or to understand why the purpose of the new Clause could not be carried out under Clause 4(1). This involves discussing the merits of the new Clause, which we shall do later, but it seems to me that the hon. Member is in a muddle about this, which has arisen from his anxiety to get as much as possible into the Bill and, after reading other Bills, to put as much as possible of them into the Bill. That may be a desirable motive, but it has resulted in a bit of a hotchpotch, and we should like to know what he intends to do to clear it up.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has thrown no light on the problems confronting the Committee. There is some confusion about the new Clause because there were two versions floating about from the Vote Office over a considerable period. One seemed to be later than the other and was on blue paper, whereas I had one which was on white paper. Both were in the hon. Member's name and dealt with an additional power to develop land.<br><br>
The hon. Member must appreciate that, under Clause 4(1) and subsequent Clauses, in some areas there will be county councils carrying out work similar to that which he envisages in the first new Clause. We cannot debate the merits of the new Clause now, but I ask the hon. Member to understand the difficulty we are in. He includes district councils in the new Clause but excludes them from Clause 4, yet under Clause 4 in some areas county councils could carry out similar work to that carried out by district or county councils under the new Clause. There will be arguments about who should do it and where the money is to be obtained. He must clear this up now, before we get into deeper water on the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty is that there is no Amendment on the Paper on this point. We are discussing the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. We can either accept or reject the Clause. I have the greatest sympathy with district councils and would like to consider this matter again, but I feel that the best time to consider it is after we have discussed some of the new Clauses, particularly the first. I hope that, on my undertaking to think about the whole subject thoroughly between now and Report, we may have this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said that this was a hotchpotch. I do not doubt that, whatever we do, it will remain a hotchpotch, for the simple reason that we have not one Bill but a collection of Bills, and are about to proceed to enact certain new Clauses which have different origins altogether.<br><br>
But before we do that we must pass the interpretation Clause. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1963-1964V005P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
that the hon. Member appreciates that the Clause begins with the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act, except where the context otherwise requires"—</p></blockquote>
This is a device which allows a certain flexibility for the hon. Member to do something in respect of local authorities beyond that which is laid down, but it is nevertheless an unsatisfactory proceeding if we have one Clause in which the definition leaves out the possibility of district councils participating and then we have a Clause which drags in district councils because suddenly the hon. Member has realised that somebody else, paying more attention to what is required or will be required to do the job, has to bring in the district councils if the job is to be done.<br><br>
He need not be despondent that this has happened to him. Nor need any hon. Member be despondent. There are respectable precedents for the House of Commons getting into bother over district councils. I remember when Mr. Speaker had to make the House go back into Committee after we had finished, I think Report stage, in order to deal with an Amendment relating to the powers of district councils. If anyone is interested in precedent, it was on the Caravan Sites and Control of Develop-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
ment Act. Under that Act district councils were given the power to provide caravan sites, but there had to be an Amendment of another Act to give them the money with which to do it, and that had been neglected. One of the dangers before the hon. Member is that he has to proceed to give powers to local district councils by specifying them in another Clause and at the same time he is cutting them out in the definition in respect of powers under Clause 4 for which they might well be required.<br><br>
He says that that power is only for big people. It can be for big people if necessary and for specific district councils if necessary, because Clause 4(1) is exercised only with the consent on each individual application of the Secretary of State for Scotland. He has the power to discriminate in the matter. I ask the hon. Member to think very seriously whether it is advisable and desirable for his own purpose to include district councils.</span></p>
