	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 5.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Effect of adoption order.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) Upon an adoption order being made, all rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parent or parents, guardian or guardians of the adopted child, in relation to the future custody, maintenance and education of the adopted child, including all rights to appoint a guardian shall be extinguished, and all such rights, duties, obligations and liabilities shall vest in and be exercisable by and enforceable against the adopter as though the adopted child was a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock, and in respect of the same matters and in respect of the liability of a child to maintain its parents the adopted child shall stand to the adopter exclusively in the position of a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock:</p>
	<p>Provided that, in any case where two spouses are the adopters, such spouses shall in respect of the matters aforesaid and for the purpose of the jurisdiction of any court to make orders as to the custody and maintenance of and right of access to children stand to each other and to the adopted child in the same relation as they would have stood if they had been the lawful father and mother of the adopted child, and the adopted child shall stand to them respectively in the same relation as a child would have stood to a lawful father and mother respectively.</p>
	<p>(2) An adopted child if adopted either by two spouses jointly or by one of two spouses in the lifetime of the other shall, for the purposes of the Widows', Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts, 1925 and 1929, be treated as being the child of those spouses and as not being the child of any other person:</p>
	<p>Provided that this sub-section shall not apply in the case of a child in respect of whom an additional allowance or orphans' pension was payable under the said Acts at the date of his adoption.</p>
	<p>(3) An adoption order shall not deprive the adopted child of any legal rights competent to him in the estate of his parents or of any right to or interest in property to which, but for the order, the child would have been entitled under any intestacy or disposition, whether occurring or made before or after the making of the adoption
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1268</span>
order, or confer on the adopted child any right to or interest in property as a child of the adopter, and the expressions "child," "children," and "issue" where used in any disposition whether made before or after the making of an adoption order, shall not, unless the contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or children or the issue of an adopted child.</p>
	<p>(4) Where an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child takes any interest in heritable or moveable property under a disposition by the adopter, or where an adopter takes any interest in heritable or moveable property under a disposition by an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, any succession, legacy or other duty which becomes leviable in respect thereof shall be payable at the same rate as if the adopted child had been a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock.</p>
	<p>(5) For the purposes of this section "disposition" means a deed, instrument or writing whether inter vivos or mortis causa whereby property is conveyed or under which a succession arises.</p>
	<p>(6) For the purposes of the enactments relating to friendly societies, collecting societies and industrial assurance companies, which enable such societies and companies to insure money to be paid for funeral expenses, and which restrict the persons to whom money may be paid on the death of a child under the age of ten, the adopter shall be deemed to be the parent of the child; and where before the adoption order was made any such insurance had been effected by the natural parent of the child, the rights and liabilities under the policy shall by virtue of the adoption order be transferred to the adopter, and the adopter shall, for the purposes of the said enactments, be treated as the person who took out the policy.</p>
	<p>Amendment proposed [8th July, 1930]: In Sub-section (3), after the word "issue," to insert the words "of any person."—[	<i>Mr. MacRobert.</i>]</p>
	<p>Question again proposed, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I moved this Amendment at the last sitting of the Committee, another Amendment has been put down in the name of the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Mathers), to which I have also put my name, dealing with this point. I understand that that Amendment was suggested by the Government draftsman, and I think it is much better than my Amendment. Accordingly, I beg leave to withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "used," to insert the words "in relation to any person."

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1269</span>
This is the Amendment to which I have already referred and to which the hon. Member for West Edinburgh has put his name. It gives effect to the view for which we were contending at the last meeting of the Committee, and I think it will make the Clause more clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. Craigie Aitchison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this Amendment ought to be accepted, and I merely wish to point out that it is exactly what the Secretary of State for Scotland suggested at the close of the discussion at the last meeting of the Committee. I am glad that my right hon. and learned Friend the late Lord Advocate, having had a week in which to think over the matter, has been unable to improve on that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the manner in which the Lord Advocate is going to put it, may I point out that this is not the Amendment which was proposed on the last occasion, but is quite a different Amendment, and it will be seen that one of the subsequent Amendments which goes with it proposes to leave out a large part of the Clause. I was willing to accept the Amendment suggested on the last occasion, but I think the present Amendment is better, and there is no point whatever in the suggestion of the Lord Advocate that we did not accept the Government proposal on the last occasion. We were quite prepared to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely wish to point out that this Amendment is exactly what the Secretary of State suggested on the last occasion, when there was so much disturbance about the absence of the Lord Advocate. May I also take the opportunity of saying that the reason for my absence was that I was attending to official business in Edinburgh. I regret that I have not the faculty of some of the hon. Gentlemen opposite of being in two places at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN GILMOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very loth to bring any controversial matter into our discussions on this Bill, but I must enter a protest against the tone of the Lord Advocate. No one quarreled with the absence of the Lord Advocate on a particular mission. What I criticised was the fact that, in my view, the Law Officers had evidently not turned their minds to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1270</span>
the details of this Measure, and that the Secretary of State, in bringing proposals before the Committee, repeatedly said, that he had consulted the Law Officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which was true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. GILMOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was quite evident that he could not have done so, because the Amendments which we were discussing were Amendments which had been, put down in the absence of the Lord Advocate, and what I protested against was the difference between the advice of the Law Officers, who are responsible to Parliament, and the advice of the staff of the Secretary of State. No doubt the staff gave good advice, but that is not the advice of the Law Officers. When the Lord Advocate has learned a little more of the procedure of this House and the responsibility of the Law Officers of the Crown to Parliament—not to any section of Parliament, but to Parliament as a whole—then he will begin to realise that we have a right to protest against a misstatement of that kind made by a Minister of the Crown. That is all we do; and as far as we are concerned, we are glad to see that this Amendment has been put down in a form which has been properly considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the last occasion there was a hurried consultation between the Secretary of State and his adviser, and, quite obviously, it had not been considered. All I want to say is that none of us protested against the Law Officers doing Government business at Edinburgh when it was right and proper, but we did protest against the Secretary of State saying he had taken the advice of his Law Officers when he had not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you had called upon me, Mr. Brown, to move this Amendment and the subsequent Amendments contingent on it, my intention was to pay tribute to the Law Officers of the Crown for the way in which they had considered this point, and to pay tribute also to the right hon. Member for East Renfrew (Mr. MacRobert) for his helpfulness as well. I am certain that if that sort of preface had been made to the introduction of the Amendment we would not have had this ripple on the waters, which is not helping the adoption of children in Scotland. It is to their help I want to come, and I hope the waters

may subside, and that we may get on happily with the conclusion of the consideration of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKINLAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want hon. Members to consult the OFFICIAL REPORT of the proceedings the last time this Committee met. It is nothing but cod and humbug for right hon. and hon. Members on the other side to say they did not take exception to the absence of the Lord Advocate. They used his absence for political propaganda carrying the insinuation that he ought to have been here when they knew perfectly well that his absence was excusable. As a young member of this Committee I do not desire Members with years of experience to draw me along the line of the difference between the Law Officers of the Crown and the legal advice of the Department. The legal advice was perfectly sound, and the last time the Committee met half its time was wasted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not let us waste any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKINLAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the OFFICIAL REPORT is consulted, it will be seen that the sole reason for the question being raised by the late Lord Advocate and the late Secretary of State for Scotland was to create the impression that the Lord Advocate, instead of being here, was conducting business in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will refer to the OFFICIAL REPORT of the proceedings:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to say, in reply to the Rt. Hon. Gentleman, that I am not complaining of the absence of the Lord Advocate. He may be away for good and sufficient reasons. What I object to is that it is now admitted that this Clause does require Amendment. That being so, why was it not scrutinised by the Law Officers?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT (	<i>Standing Committee on Scottish Bills</i>), 8	<i>th</i> July, 1930. Col. 38.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not have the suggestion made that this Bill was not scrutinised by the Law Officers. It was very carefully scrutinised and to such good purpose that at the last meeting of the Committee the Secretary of State suggested an Amendment which the right hon. Gentleman, after a week's time for consideration, cannot improve upon. I object most emphatically to the attempt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1272</span>
made by the Tory Opposition in this Committee to exploit my absence for party purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), to leave out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether made before or after the making of an adoption order."</p></blockquote>
The words to be omitted are unnecessary. They only add to the wording, without adding in any material way to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "children" ["child or children"], to insert the words "of such person."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really the point around which, shall I say, the incomprehensibility of the paragraph lay, and this makes it clear and makes the Clause really intelligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In Sub-section (3), at the end, insert the words "of such person."—[	<i>Mr. Mathers.</i>]</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>Clauses 6 (	<i>Power to make interim orders</i>) and 7 (	<i>Power to make subsequent order in respect of child already subject to an order</i>), ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Jurisdiction and procedure.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>The Court having jurisdiction to make adoption orders under this Act shall be the Court of Session, or, at the option of the applicant, but subject to any Act of Sederunt under this section, the sheriff court within whose jurisdiction either the applicant or the child resides at the date of the application for the adoption order.</li>
	<li>Provision shall be made by Act of Sederunt with regard to any matter to be prescribed under this Act to the manner in which applications to the Court are to be made and generally with regard to all matters of procedure and incidental matters arising out of this Act and for carrying this Act into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such Act of Sederunt may provide for applications for adoption orders being heard and determined otherwise than in open Court.</li>
	<li>For the purpose of any application under this Act and subject to any Act of Sederunt under this section, the Court shall appoint some person or body to act as guardian ad litem of the child upon the hearing of the application with the duty of safeguarding the interests of the child

before the Court, and where the body so appointed is a local authority the Court may authorise the authority to incur any necessary expenditure, and may direct out of which rate such expenditure is to be defrayed, but nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the Court to appoint a local authority to act as guardian ad litem of a child except with the consent of that authority.</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the option of the applicant, but subject to any Act of Sederunt under this Section."</p></blockquote>
I do not really know what these words mean. I think they should be left out, and that we should just have the ordinary form. If that is done, then the applicant always has the option to go to either court, and I think it makes it quite clear if you leave out these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment, because I think it ought to be made clear that the Court of Session is to have no power by an Act of Sederunt to take away the power of the Sheriff Court to deal with applicants of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think this Amendment does any good, but it certainly does no harm, and I think we should accept it and get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3) to leave out the words "or body".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court shall appoint some person or body to act as guardian 	<i>ad litem</i> of the child upon the hearing of the application."</p></blockquote>
The usual custom is for the Court to appoint a lawyer to act as curator 	<i>ad litem</i> when the interests of the child have to be considered. The suggestion here is that you would have a town council or a county council or some other local authority appointed to act. The idea has been borrowed from the English Bill, and, like so much borrowed from England, is subject to great suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a Scotch Committee!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no such thing as "Scotch."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of having a local authority appointed as curator to a child is absurd. Are we going to have a town clerk, or a provost, or the chair-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1274</span>
man of a county council coming in? Certainly we cannot have the Clause as it stands. I understand there is another Amendment to be moved later which may improve the position, but it is our duty to safeguard the Clause now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In consultation with the Law Officers and the legal advisers of the Government, my instruction is that the Clause will be improved if this Amendment is accepted with the other consequential Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), to leave out the word "guardian" ["act as guardian"], and to insert instead thereof the word "curator."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an obvious error. "Guardian" is not known to our law; the term is "curator."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), to leave out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and where the body so appointed is a local authority the Court may authorise the authority to incur any necessary expenditure, and may direct out of which rate such expenditure is to be defrayed, but nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the Court to appoint a local authority to act as guardian 	<i>ad litem</i> of a child except with the consent of that authority."</p></blockquote>
I think that this Amendment is consequential on the Amendment already made. The Clause has reference to a body which, under the Bill as it stood, might be appointed curator 	<i>ad litem.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to my hon. Friend that the Amendments which stand in my name—and I think there are some by the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Mathers)—improve the Bill, and make it better than the suggestion he has made. The proposal is that the local authorities should have nothing to do with the matter at all. It may be desirable in certain cases that a local authority should interest itself in a particular child to be adopted, and my Amendment will read in such a way as to give the power to the Court to appoint a duly authorised officer of the local authority. That officer will then be in the same position as the local authority, and the expenses of the adopted child can then be paid through that officer if they choose. The appointment of a corpora-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1275</span>
tion as a curator 	<i>ad litem</i> seems to me, under the law of Scotland, quite an impossibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause, as proposed to be altered, would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and where the person so appointed is an officer or servant of a local authority,"</p></blockquote>
and so on. In that case, certain expense may be incurred by the local authority. I appeal to the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) to withdraw his Amendment, of which, of course, I can quite see the point, because the Clause as it stands is nonsense. Amended, as is proposed by the subsequent Amendments, it will be all right, and I suggest that the hon. Member should withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. and learned Member for East Renfrew (Mr. MacRobert) that it is plain that you cannot appoint a local authority as curator 	<i>ad litem.</i> You must appoint an individual, and, therefore, I think the Clause should be amended on the lines proposed by the right hon. and learned Member. I hope that the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) will not insist on his Amendment, because the Clause as it stands says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court may authorise the authority"</p></blockquote>
that is, the local authority whose officer is appointed curator 	<i>ad litem,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to incur any necessary expenditure, and may direct out of which rate such expenditure is to be defrayed."</p></blockquote>
Remember, local authorities are controlled in the matter of their expenditure out of the rates. Therefore, I think authority will need to be taken in this Bill to authorise the necessary expenditure out of the rates. Accordingly, I think that that part of the Clause will need to remain in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I much prefer the Amendment of the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott). In my view there is something very unsatisfactory and doubtful about this matter, and we should have a good deal more discussion before we allow in Scotland this entirely novel idea of letting the officials of local authorities be the curators or guardians of the child, and the equally novel suggestion that any expense thereby incurred should be paid
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1276</span>
for out of the rates. This is a time when the functions of local authorities are being very much extended, but this is an extension not to be faced without very serious thought. I see no reason to suppose that there is any advantage in bringing local authorities and their officers, who have plenty to do already, into this entirely new region of responsibility. It seems to me to have no relation to the work of local authorities. There seems to me to be no excuse for it, and I do not think the local authorities will thank this Committee for imposing this burden upon them. The thing is so novel that one wants far more discussion on it. It does not seem to me a sound principle that local authorities or their officials should have the representation of individual children for the purposes of this Bill. I still less like the idea of rates being spent for this purpose, and I doubt if the suggestion of the Lord Advocate is in order that in a Bill of this sort new financial burdens should be put upon the local authorities. It is certainly not a thing that should be done without consultation with the local authorities. The responsibility is alien to their true functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss RATHBONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way acquainted with the law of Scotland, but, as a matter of common sense, I would submit that in many cases the local authority is the right body to take charge of a child where there has been failure of adoption. It would prevent the charge of the child being thrown on the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Committee to adopt the Amendment which I have suggested? Let me explain the position of the curator 	<i>ad litem.</i> When a person comes to court and asks leave to adopt a child, of course the court will not act on the applicant's statement alone. First of all, they must make sure that the child knows about what is proposed and is, to some extent, consulted, and that the child's interests are guarded. Accordingly, the court always appoints some person, usually a lawyer, very often an advocate, to act in this independent capacity. All that the curator has to do is to interview the child, and consider these circumstances and the bearing of the proposal to adopt it. He gets a modest fee. First of all, we have taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1277</span>
out of this Clause any power to appoint a body. It surely follows as a consequence that we ought to take out the rest of the Clause that empowers the body to charge the expenses on the rates. If the intention of the right hon. and learned Member for East Renfrew (Mr. MacRobert) to bring in an official of the local authorities is to make sure that the fee is forthcoming, then I say that that is not a sufficient reason for the Committee refusing to adopt this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In that case, it seems to me quite reasonable that, when an application is made, the effect of which, if granted, would be to take the child out of the care of the parish so that it would become the adopted child, the court should appoint as curator 	<i>ad litem</i> of the child someone who knows the circumstances. That is a most simple and reasonable proposal, and it does not involve any revolutionary change in the rating system of Scotland as some hon Members seem to suggest. Accordingly, I hope the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is necessary to insert such limiting words, seeing that the result of these Amendments will be that the local authority must consent before they are authorised by the court to incur any expenditure.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard it as very bad legislation to leave in such broad and general phraseology as "local authority." Only in one circumstance are we bringing in a local authority, for it is the Poor Law authority that is responsible for the child, and I urge the promoters to make this clear.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause ought to be limited to the local authority which is responsible for the child, and I trust that the promoter of the Bill, although he defeated us on the previous Amendment, will move the addition of limiting words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We do not want anything raised on the Report stage, or the Bill will never go through. The decision of the Committee is that they think it better to amend on the lines suggested by me. It may be that there are imperfections, and I ask the hon. Members to accept the Committee's findings. The limiting words suggested are "responsible for the child," but I do not think in practice that the court will ever appoint as curator 	<i>ad litem</i> an officer of an authority unless the authority has some interest in the child.

	<p>Where at the date of the commencement of this Act any child under the age of twenty-one years is in the custody of, and being brought up, maintained and educated by any person or two spouses jointly as his, her, or their own child under any de facto adoption, and has for a period of not less than two years before such commencement been in such custody and been so brought up maintained and educated, the Court may, upon the application of such person or spouses, and notwithstanding that the applicant is a male and the child a female, make an adoption order authorising him, her or them to adopt the child without requiring the consent of any parent or guardian of the child to be obtained, upon being satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case it is just and equitable and for the welfare of the child that no such consent should be required and that an adoption order should be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the word "child" ["to adopt the child"], to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such intimation, if any, as the court may direct."</p></blockquote>
This Clause contains provisions as to existing 	<i>de facto</i> adoptions that where the child has been adopted by some one for a period of not less than two years, the court may, on the application of the custodian, make an adoption order authorising him, her or them to adopt the child without requiring the consent of any parent or guardian of the child. The point of the Amendment is that the person who may have been acting as custodian for these two years may be a stranger to the child. The child's parents may still be alive, and they undoubtedly still have interest, even after the lapse of two years, to be heard by the court before a final adoption order is passed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1282</span>
by the court. I am suggesting that before the court passes the adoption order, it should take steps to inform the parents of the child, and give them a opportunity to be heard. I trust that the promoter will accept this Amendment because it is right and proper that the parents of the child should know of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacRORERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do not the court get the consent of the parents? It is because they consider that the consent of the parents ought not to be asked in particular cases because they have behaved disgracefully. Will it not be inviting trouble if intimation of the proceedings is given to such parents? Consent in ordinary cases is required, and is only taken away in exceptional cases. Is it desirable in such cases, where the court has said that the consent of the parents ought not to be required, that you should intimate to them and allow them to make trouble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any case, where the parents were known and their whereabouts known, the court would direct intimation, so I am not impressed by that argument. This Amendment is really unnecessary, because the court has an inherent power to direct intimation, and if we put in intimation, why limit it? It would be much better if the matter were left in the inherent power of the court, rather than that we should particularise in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee is performing an admirable service in discussing as many of the details of the Bill as possible, in order to make sure that its provisions are well and truly enacted.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out Sub-section (3), and to insert instead thereof the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) There shall be produced with every application for an adoption order in respect of a child whose birth has been registered under the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1854, an extract of the entry of the birth, and the adoption order in any such case shall direct the Registrar-General to cause any entry in the register of births relating to such child to be marked with the word 'adopted.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) Where, in any application for an adoption order, the date of the child's birth is proved to the satisfaction of the Court, whether by production of an extract of the entry of the birth in the register of births or otherwise, the adoption order shall direct the Registrar-General to include in the entry in the adopted children register recording the adoption the date so proved in the manner indicated in the Schedule hereto."</p></blockquote>
This rather comprehensive Amendment has the effect of making it obligatory upon those who wish to adopt a child, to present the birth certificate when making an application for an adoption order. Those who have been interesting themselves outside the House of Commons in the promotion of this Bill cordially accept the strengthening provision which this Amendment will make in the Bill, as compared with the English Measure, and I think that circumstance ought to be sufficient to commend the Amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has not given us any reason for making this change. He has merely told us that his proposal satisfies certain persons outside this House who are, as we know, very much interested in the Bill—a certain society in Scotland. He has told us that they do not object to the change,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1285</span>
but I venture to suggest that a merely negative reason of that kind, given on behalf of any body of people, whether inside or outside the House of Commons, is not a good enough reason for introducing such a considerable change. Has the hon. Member borne in mind that in many cases of adoption it may be most desirable that nothing should transpire which would injure the reputation of the mother of the child—if it is an illegitimate child—which is being adopted? In these cases it is essential that the entry in the register of births should be kept private. The wording of the Sub-section as it stands in the Bill seems designed to secure that the information shall be confidential. The court his to be satisfied as to the date of birth and the identity of the child, and it seems to me that the wording of the Subjection, as it is, suggests a privacy which does not necessarily follow from the amended wording now proposed. It seems very important in this connection to know whether it will be possible for these proceedings to be held 	<i>in camera,</i> and I should like the Lord Advocate to tell us if it will be possible for proceedings of this kind to be conducted in private. We must bear in mind all through that the reputation and happiness of the mother of the adopted child, and of other people connected with her, may depend on the manner in which these proceedings are conducted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards the last matter dealt with by the Noble Lady I would draw her attention to the provision in Clause 8, Sub-section (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such Act of Sederunt may provide for applications for adoption orders being heard and determined otherwise than in open Court."</p></blockquote>
Thus the Bill already contains a provision giving a power to the court in this respect, which, I have no doubt, will be exercised properly. I hope the Committee will accept the Amendment which does not make such an extensive alteration as might at first sight appear. As the Bill stands it provides
	<br><blockquote><p>"If upon any application for an adoption order there is proved to the satisfaction, of the Court—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a)the date of the birth of the child."</p></blockquote>
Ordinarily the best proof of the date of birth is an extract of the entry from the register of births, and, accordingly, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1286</span>
ordinary circumstances, the court would require such evidence to be produced. I think it is desirable that this provision should be made obligatory. Of course, if there is no birth certificate, it does not matter how obligatory you make it. You cannot produce something which does not exist. But if there is a birth certificate it is desirable that the court should know who are the natural parents of the child. We want to avoid any attempt on the part of people to get possession of children to which they are not entitled, and I think it most desirable that, wherever a birth certificate exists, it should be produced in order that the court may be in a position to direct intimation to the parents of the child if they are alive. It seems to me that the court would never exercise a power of this kind without intimation and that it ought not to exercise a power of this kind without intimation. Apart from that consideration, the main purpose of requiring that the birth certificate should be produced, is in order that the appropriate entries may be made in the new register to be formed under this Measure and in the old register. It is important that corresponding entries should be made. It is almost certain that this Bill will need to be followed by another Bill conferring rights on adopted children, not only in regard to workmen's compensation—which I am glad to see has been incorporated in the Bill—but as regards other kinds of rights under all kinds of legislation. In order that these matters may be effectually dealt with it is most important that proper records should be kept and the appropriate corresponding entries made. In the circumstances I hope that the noble lady will not press her objection to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with what the Lord Advocate has said and I do not think that any difficulty will arise. The new Sub-sections will only apply where there is a birth certificate, and, if there is a birth certificate in existence, the first thing that the court will do is to ask for it. That being so, if the production of the certificate is not made peremptory, delay will result because the court will delay the matter until the certificate is forthcoming. It seems absolutely right that the best evidence, if it is available, should be produced on the application and I hope that the Noble Lady will not oppose the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the explanations which have been given I withdraw my opposition to this Amendment, but I should like to be clear on one point. How far is the consent of the parent or parents necessary in the case of an adoption? Has an application to be made in every case, say, to the mother of an illegitimate child for her consent to its adoption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that matter is made plain in Clause 2, Sub-section (3), which provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an adoption order shall not be made except with the consent of every person or body who is a parent or guardian of the child in respect of whom the application is made or who has the actual custody of the child or who is liable to contribute to the support of the child."</p></blockquote>
Then there is the proviso:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the Court may dispense with any consent required by this sub-section if satisfied that the person whose con sent is to be dispensed with has abandoned or deserted the child or cannot be found or is incapable of giving such consent or, being a person liable to contribute to the support of the child, eihter has persistently neglected or refused to contribute to such support"—</p></blockquote>
I draw particular attention to the closing words of the proviso:
	<br><blockquote><p>—"or is a person whose consent ought, in the opinion of the Court and in all the circumstances of the case, to be dispensed with."</p></blockquote>
The court will exercise an equitable jurisdiction in the matter and the paramount consideration will be the welfare of the child. I suggest therefore that the point is adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are certain rather pompous words in the first three lines of Sub-section (4)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prescribed officer of the Court shall cause every adoption order to be communicated in the prescribed manner to the Registrar-General."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I shall certainly try to justify it. "In the prescribed manner" I have no doubt, means that the Court of Session by an Act of Sede-runt will frame the form to be used by the clerk of the court in sending the copy of the interlocutor to the Registrar-General. Anything more absurd or unnecessary I cannot conceive. Is it suspected that the clerk of the court is going to indulge in any frivolities in his letter to the Registrar-General; that he is going to write about the weather or the last meeting of this Committee? Of course he is going to use the stereotyped form:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I enclose herewith copy of the interlocutor. Yours truly," etc.</p></blockquote>
What is the necessity for prescribing anything in that connection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will not insist on his Amendment. He must bear in mind that when the order of the court is transmitted there may be certain directions of the court to be complied with, and it is desirable in these matters that the orders should go out in a stereotyped form. It is true that the form will be fixed by Act of Sederunt. That makes for regularity in practice, which is a very important thing when dealing with public registers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is an Act of Sederunt dealing with this point, will it not lay down the form in which the clerk of the court must send out these notices, and will that form not be obligatory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Act of Sederunt would probably deal with the form of the intimation to be made to the Registrar and it is desirable accordingly that the words "in the prescribed manner" should remain in the Bill. At any rate they cannot do any harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an Act of Sederunt has been passed to that effect, surely that Act itself would force the clerk to send out these notices in a particular manner.

Therefore, are not the words "in the prescribed manner" entirely otiose and unnecessary in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ERNEST BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, as a layman, was about to put the same point. Where is this form to be prescribed? Surely these words mean nothing unless we lay it down in this Measure that the "prescribed manner" is to be such and such a manner. I am not sure about the point, and I should like to know whether these words have any meaning at all if there is no prescribed manner set out in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the words come out, the court can still act under the provisions of Clause 8 in this matter and therefore I do not think we need waste any further time in discussing the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (5), to leave out the words "A certified copy," and to insert instead thereof the words "An extract."

	<p>Leave out the words "certified copies of entries in the certified copies of," and insert instead thereof the words "extracts of entries in."—[	<i>Mr. Mathers.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (7), to leave out the words "last mentioned," and to insert instead thereof the word "additional."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a formal Amendment. When I first read the Clause I thought the last mentioned registers referred to the Adopted Children Register, but on full examination of the Clause I do not think it could be held to mean that, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1290</span>
I suggest it would improve the Bill if the word "additional" were used. I think the word would be suitable, as at the beginning of the Sub-section it is directed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Registrar-General shall, in addition to the Adopted Children Register, keep other registers and books"</p></blockquote>
These are the additional books, and I think the word "additional" would meet the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In Sub-section (7), leave out the words "a Court of competent jurisdiction," and insert instead thereof the words "the Court of Session or a Sheriff."—[	<i>Mr. Mathers</i>].</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (7), to leave out the words "any person with."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask the Committee to look ahead in order to understand the import of the words I am now moving. I think they will be perfectly understandable if the three Amendments are taken together. It is to get more clearly at the persons [who shall have the right of access to the connecting secret link between the register of births and the register of adoption. It is consequential on what I am to move later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In Sub-section (7), leave out the word "with" ["or with any copy"].—[	<i>Mr. Mathers.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (7), at the end, to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to any person other than an adopted child who has attained the age of seventeen years and to whom such information, copy, or extract relates.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(8) The provisions of the Registration of Births, Deaths, and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1854, as amended by any subsequent enactment with regard to the registration of names given in baptism, or without baptism, after registration of birth, and with regard to the correction of erroneous entries, shall apply to the adopted children register, and to registration therein in like manner as they apply to any register of births and to registration therein."</p></blockquote>
Here I am dealing with the point with regard to the age at which an adopted child shall have the opportunity of learning, on his or her own account, what is his or her actual parentage.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1291</span>
One realises the difficulty that might arise if the Bill is left as it stands, giving to the child the opportunity at any age of getting information as to its original parentage, learning by some accident that it is not the natural child of those caring for it, and making, perhaps, considerable trouble and giving a great deal of pain not only to those who have looked after it, but to those who are its natural parents. Therefore, I think an age should be fixed, and I have put down the age of 17 years as an age of discretion, an age when it is possible in our country for marriage to take place. I think it is very necessary that when we reach the age of marriage there should be an opportunity of learning all about one's antecedents. I know the marriage age is 16, but there is a desire to keep back the disclosure of this information as long as conveniently possible, and on that account the age has been put down at 17 instead of the strict marriage age. I hope that these considerations will commend themselves to the Committee, and that this age may be put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Those who are responsible for registration in Scotland regard the words heading the columns of the Schedule in operation in England as being unnecessarily complicated and explanatory, and I am moving the substitution of this simpler and more easily complied-with Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>

	<p>Bill, as amended, ordered to be reported to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who succeeded to the position of adopted parent of this Bill, it might be suitable if I were to explain the position in which I was placed. I set out some months ago to secure for one child in my constituency the benefits of the Widows', Orphans' and Contributory Old Age Pensions Act. I found, on following the matter up, that the only way in which that could be done was to deal with the whole question of the adoption of children in Scotland. I proceeded to do that with assistance by copying very closely the English Act and putting it forward as a Bill. On doing that, I found I was entrenching on other people's preserves, and that other people
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1294</span>
had been working at the same problem before, and were anxious and enthusiastic about getting it dealt with. I desire to acknowledge the very great assistance that those who had previously been working on this problem have given to me in getting this Bill brought forward. I am asking for the further assistance of this very international committee to help me with the further stages of this Bill. I wish to conclude by moving to you, Mr. Brown, a hearty vote of thanks for the very kindly way in which you have helped us in our consideration of this Bill and the way in which you have striven for peace in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
