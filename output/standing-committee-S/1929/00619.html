	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Amendments of principal Act, etc.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>The principal Act shall have effect as if the provisions of this Act with respect to the repair, closing, or demolition of insanitary houses and the acquisition of buildings consisting wholly of closed houses and the provisions thereof with respect to the clearance or improvement of unhealthy areas were inserted in Parts I and II respectively of the principal Act in substitution for the provisions therein contained with respect to the power of a local authority to repair houses, to make closing and demolition orders, to acquire closed houses and to remove obstructive buildings, and for the provisions therein contained with respect to the making, confirmation and execution of improvement schemes and reconstruction schemes.</li>
	<li>The amendments specified in the second column of the Fourth Schedule to this Act (which relate to minor and consequential details) shall be made in the sections of the principal Act specified in the first column of that Schedule.</li>
	<li>The amendments specified in the second column of the Fifth Schedule to this Act (being amendments consequential on the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929) shall be made in the sections of the Housing, &c., Act, 1923, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, and the principal Act specified in the first column of that Schedule.</li>
	<li>In provisions of the principal Act relating to offences, for the words "on summary conviction," wherever they occur, there shall be substituted the words "on conviction by a court of summary jurisdiction."</li></ol></p>
	<p>Amendment proposed [17th June]: To leave out Sub-section (4).—[	<i>Mr. MacRobert.</i>]</p>
	<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Johnston)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we can accommodate our views to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
views of hon. Gentlemen opposite on the point that was under discussion when we adjourned at our last meeting. It will be remembered that, just after my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate had explained what the Clause means, the late Lord Advocate, in his concluding sentences, just before the adjournment, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there are any particular offences under the Bill which it is thought can more appropriately go to another court, such as the Justice of the Peace Court, I have no objection to that, providing it is specifically stated, but I object to a general repeal of the present system."—[OFFICIAL REPORT (	<i>Standing Committee on Scottish Bills</i>), 17th June, 1930; col. 422.]</p></blockquote>
On further reconsideration of the matter, there is at least one point on which we think it advisable that an appeal should go to the Sheriff. I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will agree that on trivial matters, about by-laws and minor offences, it would be a sheer waste of public money and of legal and official time for the Procurator Fiscal to take these questions, say, to the county town and to a Sheriff for decision. I am sure that that is also the opinion of the late Lord Advocate, as it is the opinion of the present Lord Advocate. But when we come to an offence such as is referred to in Sub-section (2) of Section 107 of the Act of 1925, where a member of a local authority, or of a committee of a local authority, may vote on a matter relating to housing in which he is personally interested, we agree with the late Lord Advocate and other hon. Gentlemen opposite that it would be inappropriate and inadvisable that in such a case the trial should take place before the fellow magistrates of the member in question, who would also be members of the local town council, and may also have given a vote on the issue. We think that in such a case it is clearly advisable that the trial should be before a Sheriff, and not before members of the city council or town council who themselves may have a vested interest in the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BROOKE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that apply to district councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It applies to a member of the local authority. The point is that, where a local authority has given a vote on a housing question, such as the letting of a house, and a member of the council has given a vote, which he is not legally entitled to do, on the question,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
say, that he himself should get a house, if such a case is taken by the Procurator Fiscal, we agree that it would be inadvisable that it should be tried in a local police court, where the magistrates would also be members of the council. We say that, in the interests of justice and of fair play all round, it is advisable that in such a case the trial should take place before the Sheriff. If it will meet the wishes of hon. Members opposite and in all parts of the Committee, the Government are prepared, in Sub-section (4) of Clause 41, after the word "offences," to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"other than under Sub-section (2) of Section 107 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1925,"</p></blockquote>
the obvious purpose being to exclude from decision by a Court of summary jurisdiction the kind of offences which I have just specified. If that meets the general wishes of the Committee, we shall be happy to hand in such an Amendment and let it be agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN GILMOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we should be prepared to agree that the Government are meeting us in this matter. I am quite certain that none of us wish to hold up the settlement of minor problems, and, in so far as it is possible to expedite decisions in these matters, I am in agrement; but we did feel, and I think that what the Under-Secretary has just said confirms us in feeling, the necessity of safeguarding certain of these cases. Even from the point of view of the local authorities concerned, it is very desirable that no question should arise on these matters, and I think that that point of view is sound. I would like to ask the Under-Secretary, however, whether, in one of the Clauses, I think Clause 15, which we have already dealt with, this question was not missed. If I recollect aright, this point was referred to at our last meeting, and I would ask the Under-Secretary whether it will not be necessary to insert a similar Amendment there if we agree to the Amendment which he now suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman that the reference to a Court of summary jurisdiction in Clause 15, to which he refers, relates purely to minor offences. We agree, however, that the point which we are now
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
meeting in Clause 41 deals with what, if I may say so, might be called, if not a major offence, at least an offence which could not properly be tried in a burghal Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARCUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is apparent that there is an attempt, in Sub-section (4) of Clause 41, to depart from what is considered in Scotland to be a well established legal practice, namely, that a justice of the peace should not be called upon to adjudicate in cases connected with housing legislation. I appreciate very much the statement of the Under-Secretary, but I still feel very strongly that we must keep in view the fact that in every case where proceedings are taken in regard to such an offence it is at the instance of the local authority, and, even in cases of minor offences, it should be the Sheriff's Court that decides. I would point out that at the present moment very minor offences in connection with other legislation—motor legislation and so on—are dealt with by the Sheriff. The fact must also be kept in view that justices of the peace, if I may say so without any disrespect to them, are not competent to judge in cases of this kind, because their present experience is confined to passing judgment on such matters as claims for theft under the sum of £5, and I do not see how, with the best will in the world, they can be called upon to deal with the points, very often of a technical and legal character, involved in offences of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point in support of what I am saying. The Sheriff has special knowledge in the civil field, as distinct from what may be called the criminal field, in connection with housing legislation and the administration of Acts, and he is, therefore, particularly competent, from his special knowledge of the application of Housing Acts, to judge in the case of offences with which persons may be charged under such Acts. Therefore, I think that the Government ought to give this matter still further consideration, and ought to preserve intact the jurisdiction of the Sheriff in all cases connected with housing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. Craigie Aitchison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which has already received very full consideration
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
by the Government, having clearly in view that what we propose does involve an alteration in practice as far as offences under the Housing Acts are concerned. But I rather demur from the view that there is any alteration in principle involved. My predecessor in office said at the last meeting of the Committee that it was undesirable that local authorities, or rather the magistrates who were identified with local authories, should be judges in matters in which they themselves had an interest. That point is a good point in so far as there is any personal interest held by the magistrate in the matter, and we are dealing with the situation in the Amendment which the Under-Secretary is prepared to insert. But it is quite wrong to say that the magistrates are disqualified from judging because they have to deal with a matter affecting their own administration. Magistrates every day discharge judicial functions connected with their own administration. A very familiar instance is where magistrates have to deal with a breach of the by-laws which they themselves make under statutory powers, but I never heard it suggested that because they had to deal with breaches of by-laws which they themselves make therefore they do not discharge their judicial functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARCUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to point out that these by-laws have to do with the local authority, but this legislation deals with other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that affects my point. I am dealing with the argument put forward by my predecessor in office that the magistrates should not be the judges because they are members of the local authority which has an interest in the matter. I am pointing out that if you push that argument to its logical conclusion you deprive the magistrates from judging in regard to matters relating to breaches of the bylaws which they as members of the local authority themselves make. There are two further observations which I should like to make. If we were here proposing to extend the jurisdiction of the magistrates with reference to crimes I should agree with the opposition to any such extension. The question of the power of the inferior courts in relation to crimes is a very difficult question, but we are dealing here not with crimes but with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
statutory offences under the Housing Acts the great majority of which are of a comparatively minor character. Let us take one example. Section 104 of the principal Act provides a penalty where a person obstructs an officer in the discharge of his statutory duty. Why should not that be dealt with by a magistrate or a justice of the peace? I could give illustration after illustration of the same kind. Section 106 provides a penalty for a person wilfully damaging property. Why should not that be dealt with by a magistrate? The fact that it is an offence under a Housing Act does not make any difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that these offences are already dealt with by summary jurisdiction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but summary conviction will not do; it must be conviction by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. It is a technical distinction, but it is one which has been recognised by a decision of the High Court. I would like to make this final observation in asking the Committee to accept the Amendment which the Government proposes; the Committee must keep in view that when prosecutions take place for offences under the Housing Act those prosecutions are not at the instance of the local authority at all. The prosecutions are at the instance of the Public Prosecutor. [An HON. MEMBER: "Who appoints him?"] I do not care who appoints him. I demur from the suggestion implied in the interjection that the Public Prosecutor will not discharge his duty judicially, and that because he is appointed by the local authority he will incline the scales in favour of the local authority's view. I think that is an altogether unwarranted reflection upon the public prosecutors. In every case the matter will be given very careful consideration before a prosecution is lodged. Consequently, in my view, that objection fails and in the whole circumstances, especially having regard to the very heavy burdens that are placed upon the Sheriffs at the present time, who have had to deal within the last 10 years with statutory offences which have multiplied 10 and sometimes 20 fold, it is very desirable that so far as these comparatively minor statutory offences are concerned we should confer jurisdiction upon the magistrates and upon
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
the justices of the peace, both of whom act upon expert advice. In the case of the magistrates there are legal assessors and the stipendiary magistrates are in most cases qualified lawyers able to deal with any legal question which may arise. Accordingly I hope the Committee will accept the proposal of the Government that this Clause shall stand with the Amendment indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN GILMOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Amendment made: In Sub-section (4) after the word "offences" insert the words "other than under Sub-section (2) of Section 107 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1925."—[	<i>Mr. Adamson.</i>]</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>Clauses 42 (	<i>Repeals</i>) and 43 (	<i>Short Title, Construction and extent</i>) ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Power to local authority to purchase cleared land which owners have failed to redevelop.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>Where land has been cleared of buildings in accordance with a clearance order made under this Part of this Act the local authority may, at any time after the expiration of eighteen months from the date on which the clearance order became operative, determine to purchase any part of that land which, at the date of the passing of their resolution, has not been or is not in process of being used for building purposes or otherwise developed by the owner thereof.</li>
	<li>A local authority shall deal with any land purchased by them under this section by sale, letting, or appropriation, in accordance with the provisions of section four of this Act.—[	<i>Mr. Johnston.</i>]</li></ol></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate that every Member of the Committee will agree with this new Clause. I understand that it was the desire in all parts of the Committee that something like this should be done. It will be remembered that when we were dealing with clearance areas the point was raised about cases where land was cleared and buildings were knocked down, but the owner did not clear away the rubbish, or where alternatively he did not develop the area. All we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
seeking to do here is to give the local authority power after 18 months have elapsed to purchase the land which is undeveloped in the clearance area at its site value. In these circumstances I trust that the Committee will agree to let the local authorities have that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the words "in process of being used for building purposes or otherwise developed," which are pretty wide, will be taken by the courts to include 	<i>bona fide</i> building operations that are in the course of negotiation. Negotiations are sometimes somewhat protracted and it would be hard if the local authorities treated them as not coming within this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention of the Clause. No local authority would be in the least likely to make a compulsory purchase of the land where the owner was in negotiation for having it dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause added to the Bill.</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Application in improvement area of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Where any action taken by a local authority under section six of this Act with respect to a dwelling-house in an improvement area results in the tenant of that house or of any part thereof removing therefrom then, notwithstanding anything in section two of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, 1920 to 1925, if applicable to that house or part, shall not cease to apply thereto by reason only of the fact that upon such removal the landlord comes into possession of the house or part of a house.—[	<i>Mr. Johnston.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be remembered that, in an earlier stage, when we were dealing with an improvement area, apart from the building, the apprehension was expressed that, where an overcrowded house in an improvement area had its family taken away and put in a new house, or where the owner was compelled to execute repairs and consequently get rid of the family, there would be a period in which the owner could be said to have acquired physical possession of the house. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1157</span>
said that we would endeavour later on to bring in a Clause which would prevent automatic decontrol of such houses. The same point has arisen on the English Bill. While we are doing everything we can to wipe out the insanitary house, it would be sheer folly to provide through it a fresh weapon for decontrolling houses and raising rents automatically. We confine this new Clause to the improvement areas because it is only in improvement area houses that this problem arises. I trust that the Committee will see the advisability of this new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure how this Clause falls under the Title of the Bill. We are stating here that we are to amend the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, and the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1925. In the Title of the Bill it says that it is to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Make further and better provision with respect to the clearance or improvement of unhealthy areas, the repair, demolition or dosing of insanitary houses and the housing of persons of the working classes in Scotland; to amend the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1925, the Housing, etc., Act, 1923, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, and other enactments relating to housing subsidies; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid."</p></blockquote>
I think there has been discussion before as to how far, under "purposes connected with the matters aforesaid," we can amend the Rent (Restrictions) Acts. If they can be amended under this Bill we might find ourselves plunged into the whole question of rent restrictions here or on Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the hon. and gallant Member is stretching it a little too far. We are not amending the Rent (Restrictions) Acts at all. All we are saying is that they shall not cease to apply in these particular houses, and that in the operation of this Bill, in which we are seeking to stop overcrowding, it would be obviously unjust, unfair, and unreasonable—and, indeed, never contemplated—that it should be used as a pretext and subterfuge for getting behind the Rent Restrictions Acts. If we are going to amend the Rent (Restrictions) Acts, let us face up boldly to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may save the time of the Committee if I say that, in my opinion, after having considered the matter, I have decided that it is in order.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
The matter was also considered on the English Bill and the Chairman decided that it was in order. I admit that, dialectically, an English Committee is not the same as a Scottish Committee, but we have considered this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support this new Clause. There was a good deal of discussion on this in the earlier stages and this Clause, I understood, was put down with the general consent of the Committee. There is no attempt to amend the Rent (Restrictions) Acts at all. As a matter of fact, the Bill can very well do without this Clause, but it is a clarifying Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Chairman, but I must say that it seems to me difficult to justify the contention that we are not altering the Rent Restrictions Acts when we say that they shall not apply to cases where they would apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are applied to these houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Rent (Restrictions) Acts say that when a house comes into the physical possession of the owner the rent restrictions shall cease to apply. Quite apart from the overcrowded family, we are dealing with the simple case of a house where some considerable alteration has to take place. The family goes to another house where it has to pay a higher rent. Another family is waiting somewhere else. These things are carried through; a complete change of tenancy takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and gallant Member discussing my Ruling? That would not be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely bow to your Ruling that the Clause is in order. I am discussing whether the Government have not stretched this Amendment rather wide. We all agree with the case of a family which has to move out of a house because of painting or papering or the putting in of a water closet, but I am considering the poor family which loses this house under this Bill, another family comes in at the old controlled rent and the family which has lost the house has insult added to injury by having to move into a new house at a higher rent while a new tenant has the old house at a lower rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and gallant Member want the rent to be increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only saying that a grievance does exist. Our point is that the continued control of some houses is producing a greater and greater crop of anomalies and that, in fact, the only remedy is a vigorous policy of building houses. As soon as you get a surplus of houses in the market it will have the same effect in reducing prices as a surplus of every other commodity. One of the great difficulties of housing is that a great area of controlled rents exists. The artificially low rent of the houses, in fact, produces a hold-up of houses everywhere. Our view in general is that the control of one class of houses is producing not only anomalies but an actual shortage of houses for the people, and if the cost of living goes up you find an automatic increase in the resources required to carry that cost of living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point of Order. Is not the hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Major Elliot) covering far more ground than comes within the scope of this new Clause? He knows perfectly well that we are anxious to get this Bill and one would think that he had been wound up, to judge from the way in which he is rattling off speeches. I want you, Mr. Chairman, to protect us from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and gallant Gentleman is getting rather wide of the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, to the Committee for being led away into the interesting fields of economic discussion with the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood), with whom I always find it difficult to refrain from argument; but I would point out that this proposed amendment of the law means that in certain cases where the decontrol provisions of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts have applied they will not apply in future. The place in which to amend the Rent (Restrictions) Acts is in a Bill of that kind, and not in a Housing Bill. The policy of this new Clause is the artificial control of certain rents. To that policy we are opposed and we ask the Government to consider whether they

have not drawn this new Clause rather widely and whether they really desire to stretch it so much further than the case given by the Under-Secretary. I hope that the Government will consider that matter before the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. and gallant Member proceeds upon an entire misconception of the meaning and effect of the Clause. The Clause does not alter the law, but maintains the law. It provides that the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts shall not cease to apply, and that is not an alteration of the law but a preservation of the existing position. The Clause is designed to prevent the landlord taking advantage of a possession, which he has obtained through the action of the local authority, to operate decontrol. I think that is a wise provision. At present all kinds of devices are being employed to operate decontrol, quite contrary to the intentions of the Statute, although it is extremely difficult to get at those devices by any legal process. What the Government ask the Committee to do is to say that where a landlord comes into possession owing to the action of the local authority, he is not to take advantage of that possession in order to operate a decontrol which he would not otherwise operate, and I ask the Committee to accept the new Clause in the form in which it is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause appears very formidable and difficult but I think I can explain its purport very briefly, and I trust that after my explanation the Committee will see fit to add it to the Bill. The first object of the Clause is to secure that adequate publicity shall be given to the confirmation by the Department of either a clearance order or a compulsory purchase order. Its second object is to ensure that the power of legal appeal against such confirmation shall be limited in point of time. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have put down a number of Amendments to the Schedules to ensure that an owner shall have an adequate opportunity of appeal against any such confirmation. They suggest that there should be a period of 30 days within which an owner can institute an appeal. We have accepted the period of 30 days and the Clause provides that, if
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
the usual steps have been taken, and the Department has confirmed a clearance order or compulsory purchase order, the proprietor then may appeal, on a point of law, to the Court of Session within 30 days. It is obviously necessary that some limit should be placed on the period of time within which an owner can make such an appeal. If there were no such limit it might be possible for an owner to make an appeal 10 weeks, or 10 months, or even 10 years after an order has been confirmed; when perhaps the local authority has built the houses. The local authority would thus stand to be shot at on points of law over a very considerable period of time. This new Clause is proposed to meet that difficulty and also to meet the fears of hon. Gentlemen in this Committee and widespread criticisms in the Press and in Parliament as to the possibility of the Department being the final court of appeal in these matters. The Clause will ensure that there shall be a court of appeal on points of law, but we ask that the time shall be definitely limited to 30 days and that if, after 30 days, no appeal has been made, then the confirmation of the order shall have the force of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why has it been considered necessary to provide that no appeal shall lie to the House of Lords without the consent of the Court of Session?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter relating solely to Scotland. The questions to be decided by the Court will be as to the validity of orders, made by the Department or the local authority under the provisions of this Measure, and those questions will not depend upon general considerations common to the law of the two countries. For my part I see no objection to giving a right of appeal to the House of Lords except that in these administrative matters it is desirable to get finality, and appeals to the House of Lords involve a good deal of delay. We have selected as the tribunal for this purpose the Court of Session and not the Sheriff Court, and the Committee can feel assured that any decision will be an authoritative decision by a court of very high standing. In these circumstances the Government think it would be enough to obtain the decision of the Court of Session and

	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I observe that, under this provision, in a particularly difficult case, leave to appeal could be given.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend points out, the Court of Session may grant leave to appeal in appropriate cases. That is a familiar procedure in Scotland and the Committee may take it that, in all cases where leave is applied for, the Court of Session considers the matter judicially. They do not refuse leave to appeal because their view may not be agreed with by the House of Lords. The Court approaches the matter from an entirely different angle and, if they think that there is a real question to be tried, then they grant leave. I think this provision enabling the Court of Session to grant leave to appeal meets the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FREDERICK THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposed new Clause deals with the validity and the date of operation of orders under this Measure, but it will be remembered that the ex-Lord Advocate raised certain other points.

Of course there are Amendments on the Paper dealing with those matters, but I wish to know if the Under-Secretary has them in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

stand that we are to be confined to the Court of Session in Scotland, and that we are to have no recourse to the House of Lords on these matters? I may remind the hon. Member that one of the outstanding decisions in the history of housing in Scotland in our time was given by the House of Lords on a point which had previosuly been turned down in the High Court in Edinburgh—what we in Scotland call "The green tables at Edinburgh."

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. W. SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sub-section (3) of this proposed new Clause states that:

he may make an application, and I should like to ask what is the necessity for the other words of the Sub-section:
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the ground that it is not within the powers of this Act,"</p></blockquote>
and so on? Surely, it would be much better that, if any person aggrieved by an order desires to question its validity on any ground, he should have power to make an application within 30 days. It seems to me that there might be other grounds for questioning the validity of the order than those stated in the Sub-section. Why should they be ruled out?

I do that, in the case of Kerr 	<i>v.</i> Bryde, the House of Lords backed up the decision of the Court of Session. I know that perfectly well, but it is just because of that fact that I want to be sure here. It does not necessarily follow that because it happened on that occasion it will always happen.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARCUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point that I wish to raise in connection with the application to the Court of Session. Sub-section (3, 	<i>i</i>) says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of the order shall be suspended until the final determination of the proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Anyone with experience of the Court of Session knows that that may mean a delay of 12 months, or even two years, and it seems to me that some kind of provision ought to be made which would enable the Court to deal summarily with applications of this kind so that the usual delay in connection with litigation should not take place. The matter is obviously one of urgency, and I think that for the sake of expedition there should be some provision for appeal, either to the Bill Chamber or by some other means well known to those who practise in the Court of Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for putting down this Clause is that there is a tendency on the part of local authorities, in providing houses under slum clearance schemes, to provide almost entirely tenement property. While that may be almost a necessity in some of the larger cities, the whole object of the Bill is to raise the standard of housing in Scotland. We do not limit ourselves to the standard obtaining in England. While I should prefer to prevent local authorities from building tenements at all, I realise that in the larger cities considerations of cost, and the necessity for rehousing tenants as near as possible to their former homes, probably make it necessary to allow local authorities to build a certain proportion of these houses, but, on the score of public health, we have had repeated reports that the common stair is largely responsible for the increased prevalence and rapid spread of those infectious diseases which particularly affect children. We have had reports to that effect from the late medical officer of health for Glasgow, and we have his assurance that such diseases are largely spread by the system of common stairs in tenement houses. Where families have been re-housed in non-tenement properties, although the only change in their conditions of life has been a change of house, and there has been no improvement in their economic condition, we find a great improvement as regards the incidence of those particular diseases,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
and I submit that, if the Committee will accept this Clause, it will contribute to the improvement of the health of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are entirely in sympathy with all that my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrew (Dr. Forgan) has said regarding the desirability, wherever possible, of erecting cottage houses as against tenement houses. There are, however, unfortunately, certain physical and geographical disabilities which, we are advised, prevent us from accepting this as a compulsory provision. It is quite true that it is the practice now, and was, indeed, as we are glad to acknowledge, the practice of our predecessors in office, to do everything possible, in approving of local authorities' schemes, to ensure that as many cottages as possible and as few tenements as possible shall be erected, and I think I am right in saying that within recent years no tenement of more than three storeys has been approved for grant, and that even in the case of three-storeyed tenements there have not been more than six families to the stair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the close. We have definitely limited the number of houses to 24 to the acre. There are a few cases where we have been compelled for geographical reasons—where there was no other land available in the area—to permit a slightly larger number to the acre, but as a general rule it can be said that housing in Scotland is now being conducted, for grant-earning purposes, on the basis of about 24 houses to the acre. The worst case that we have had recently is that of St. Leonards, in Edinburgh, where I think there were 460 to the acre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SINKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 640.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was on one very small part of the scheme. I am taking the scheme as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the number of persons, or of families?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number of persons. That, of course, is abnormal, and I am not saying at all that it is anything like the average. The attempts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
that have been made in recent years to limit the number of houses built to the acre for grant-earning purposes have at any rate been so far successful that in no case are more than 24 houses permitted to the acre. That is in the case of tenements. In view of this proposed new Clause, I asked the Department to get me the figures showing what has been possible in slum clearance schemes, and I find that up to the 30th April, 1930, including cottages, flatted houses and tenements, there have been only 2.9 per cent. of actual cottages, 46 per cent. of flatted houses and 51 per cent. of tenements. That is to say, all over Scotland, 51 per cent. of the persons rehoused have had to be re-housed in tenements. The general desire of the present Government, and, as I am happy to acknowledge, also of our predecessors, has been to secure the maximum number of cottages and the minimum number of tenements in any scheme, but there are instances in Scotland where it is geographically or administratively impossible for us to insist on the terms laid down in this proposed new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas, for example, where the local authorities say that they are entirely built up, and where at the moment it is a question of struggling for the widening of the burghal area. There are other instances where the amount of possible housing land is very limited, even in areas which are not burghal areas; and the fixation in hard terms of the limit set down by my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrew would, I am advised, be impossible to work. If my hon. Friend could be content with the assurance that it is the practice of the Department now, and it is the intention of the Department in future, in every case to approve of as many cottage houses and as few tenements as possible, I am very glad to give that assurance, but, as I have said, a fixation in stated terms such as my hon. Friend has moved is, we are advised, impossible, and would in some cases prevent local authorities from dealing with their slum populations under the terms of our Bill. For these reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend will see his way not to press the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the Under-Secretary has said against this Amendment. I think it is rather a dan-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
gerous Amendment, in so far as it restricts local authorities. While one might prefer to live in a four-block flatted house, with a garden, there are many who would rather live in a house such as has been described, with six in the close—that is, two tenants on each stair-head. Such people have no wish for a garden. After they have worked all day they do not want to be bothered with a garden; all they want is an aspidistra in a pot, or something of that kind. Then there are also constructive difficulties. In some of the housing schemes in Glasgow where they have housed the people in tenements central heating has been installed. It is more economical for a scheme of that kind to have the houses built in blocks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A better idea would be to have the workers in compounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) has his own ideas on the subject, and so have I. I was in Barcelona not many months ago and visited some housing schemes of the tenement type with substantial stone fronts which had been newly built, and there are many people in this country who would prefer such houses to the four-in-a-block flatted type. I agree with the Under-Secretary that we want to house the people comfortably, and I do not want to see the local authorities restricted in any way, beyond the number of houses or the number of tenants to the acre. In 1925, when the Bill for extending the Glasgow boundaries was before Parliament, it was stated that in South Kensington there were about 1,000 people to the acre. When you take off the Albert Hall, the museums and the many parks in South Kensington, you are surprised at that statement, but in housing the people it may be that you can give them open spaces and plenty of accommodation for public buildings if you will allow them to do it in their own way, subject to certain regulations in regard to public health. I therefore support the view expressed by the Under-Secretary that this Amendment should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss LEE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Under-Secretary has been singularly unfortunate in his supporter, because the arguments brought forward in support of his case are precisely the arguments that some of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>
us are inclined to oppose, namely that if the local authority is left a free choice between the tenement type of house and the cottage type they will adopt the former because it is cheaper. The grants are going to be given according to the number of persons displaced, and there will be a serious temptation to build tenements because they are cheaper. I appreciate the difficulties of the Government. I have one of these cottage schemes in my constituency to which people have been removed from the slum areas in Glasgow. They have been complaining very bitterly because people with incomes of £1 per week have been asked to pay a rent of 15s. per week in addition to travelling expenses. But I submit that the attitude of the Socialist party should not be to crib, cabin and confine housing schemes because of the present economic circumstances of the wage earning classes. I submit that we should make supplementary allowances to meet that difficulty. I think that the Amendment of the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Dr. Forgan) makes provision for getting rid of the real difficulty. I want the Under-Secretary to tell me whether he is going to encourage the cottage type of house rather than the flatted type? I hope I am not unduly sceptical, but I fear that if it is left to mere pursuasion the local authority will listen respectfully and then go their own way. Will the Under-Secretary say that where there are insurmountable travelling difficulties, and where land can be got and it is almost as easy to put up cottage houses as tenement houses, what precisely the Government is going to do? I think that the whole Committee would wish that the later alternative should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have spoken again but for the fact that the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Train) has supported the Under-Secretary for Scotland. I know the hon. Member's point of view about housing, and it is the very opposite of that held by the Labour movement. I was born and bred in a tenement, and I know what it is to be reared in a tenement and to have escaped from a tenement into a cottage type of home. I know the difference it makes to a worker's wife who has to rear a family in a tenement. It is well nigh impossible to bring up a family in such places according to the best and highest ideals that are supposed to be characteristic of Scotland. The War shook the housing of the country to its foundations and men like the Member for Cathcart who have had a monopoly of the housing of the people in this country, found that they could not do it, and the local authorities and the State had to step in and build houses. They have built houses of the cottage type. We have propagated that idea through the Labour movement in Scotland and have at last got the people to accept it and see that it is far superior to the system of tenement dwellings, I hope therefore that the Under-Secretary will not turn down this Amendment hastily because of geographical conditions. That is a very vague term and may mean anything. Surely if the Scottish Office wants land for housing it will get land if the land is there, and no one will tell me that there is not land lying idle in Scotland which is capable of holding houses.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Chairman, but this is a very serious point with me—the housing of the working classes—and I object to extending still further the tenement system in Scotland. I think the Scottish Office ought to set its face firmly against that idea. I know the terrible life which my wife led in a tenement. She had to live shut up on the top flat of a four-storey building with half-a-dozen children and never got downstairs from one week's end to the other. As one who knows what the tenement system is, I have tried to make Scotland better than it was when I arrived on the scene. I hope, therefore, that the Under-Secretary will not brush this matter aside as lightly as all that. The very idea of 24 homes to the acre is a disgrace. I can remember on one occasion the King—and I am in order to use this phrase—said, "It is not houses that the people of the country require; it is homes." You cannot give people homes with 24 to the acre. I have been to all parts of Britain to see housing schemes. We set out our ideas before the War for the cottage type of house and we set out with the idea of 12 homes to the acre. Dr. Chalmers, Medical Officer of Health for Glasgow, proved that the best we could get was eight homes to the acre. But we were prepared to compromise. Twenty-four to the acre is far too much and they will not be healthy happy homes. The windows will be looking into one another and there will be no privacy, absolutely none. Therefore, I appeal to the Scottish Office to make it less than 24 to the acre and to reconsider this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major COLVILLE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that while persuasive eloquence is all very well, we must face the hard facts of the position, and if this Clause is carried it will hinder local authorities in dealing with the slum

problem. The question of expense must be faced. The economic position of the country is such that it cannot face the proposal. There is also the question of the actual land available within a certain area. I do not believe that the question of getting the land from landlords will hold it up. We must face the expense of the building, the land available for development, and the travelling of men to their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMES WELSH (Paisley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Dr. Forgan) has served a very useful purpose in ventilating this subject. Most of us are anxious to encourage dwellings other than tenements. It is not always understood that the cottage type of house is quite a different house from the flatted type of house, and that the flatted type of house is not a tenement. So far as slum clearance is concerned, the cottage type is outside actual possibilities. They have developed in the flatted direction, four houses to a block, each with a separate entrance and a separate piece of ground. My constituency would be affected by this proposal, and their point of view is that any new houses they build are going to be tenement houses, and the result of this Clause would not be to do anything to help the solution of the difficulty but would give the local authority an incentive to do nothing at all and leave the people in their present conditions. I agree entirely with the Under-Secretary that we want, first of all, to leave local authorities as much power as possible with certain safeguards. If, for example, by discussion with the town clerk of Paisley the central authority can get development half on one system and half on another, then that is all to the good. Within the past few months they have succeeded in getting them to consider a larger proportion of three-apartment houses. The Department are, if anything, in advance of the local authorities. They are continually urging the local authorities forward and are very useful in that respect. I want to avoid the position arising in Paisley that local authorities will take up the view that they need do nothing at all. The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) must admit that the tenements being built nowadays with six tenants and a close are a very different thing from what tenements used to be long ago. In Glas-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
gow a great deal has been done in the way of providing flatted houses in slum clearance schemes. I would strongly advise the Committee to leave the matter as it is. The discussion has been useful and we certainly want to encourage the best type of house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. W. SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to press the point that has just been made that in dealing with the housing of our people we must remember the difference between tenements put up to-day and the old tenements. There is a great difference. I know a case of an unfortunate mother with small children who had to cart her pram up three flights of stairs. What we want to see more is that the proper class of tenement house is built. When we have slum clearances we should insist that these tenement houses contain some shed where a tenant can keep a pram. It seems to me that the tenement house can be a good thing in some cases, provided that there is a proper distance and amount of open space between tenements. You might actually have more open space for your people than the cottage. I Know in Aberdeen certain houses that were put up, all with a garden in front, and people have complained that they have not the time to keep their garden tidy. Yet they all have to have this bit of ground. Can we not do something to insist that a tenement must have an open stair instead of a closed one? There is no more danger from an open stair, if it is properly constructed, and you do away with the trouble of insufficient ventilation. In a cottage house every time the people open the door they more or less air their house, but with a tenement that has a closed entry there is no air. With the door of a tenement opening on to a balcony or verandah there are certain disadvantages, but with the door opening on to a protected and yet well ventilated landing the tenement house, if you have the proper class of tenant, can be very useful. I appeal to the Secretary of State to put something in the Bill to say that there must be open stairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this discussion has shown the great desirability of leaving in the hands of the Minister a certain amount of latitude in dealing with these matters. We have just had an interesting suggestion from the hon. Member for Central Aberdeenshire (Mr.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
R. W. Smith), but I think hon. Members will agree that the more we lay down by Statute the minute conditions in which these houses are to be built the more we shall have to grant exemptions and get back to the position where we have, so to speak, to "wangle" the Statute. You cannot divest the Minister of his responsibility of administering these matters, and his administration is subject to continuous review, and it is impossible for the House to lay it down once for all in a Statute what the action of the Minister is to be. There is, for instance, the vexed question of two-roomed houses. A general indication was laid down long ago in a Statute on that matter, but it was found impossible to hold to it absolutely, and the Department has carried on a continuous process of upgrading in this matter by administrative pressure. May I remind the hon. Lady the Member for North Lanark (Miss Lee) that the Department can bring to bear a great deal of administrative pressure in this matter. It has the power of refusing grants, which is a most conclusive way of dealing with a local authority. The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Train) will remember the long controversy which I had with him about the proportion of two-roomed and three-roomed houses in the Lower Ward of Lanark, and I am sure he will admit that the Department can exercise tremendous pressure, other than persuasive pressure, in these matters. The Department ought to be allowed to exercise its power. The Minister in Parliament can be called upon to account for the way in which he is exercising that pressure, and, for all those reasons, I ask the Committee to leave this an administrative matter and not to think that they can wash their hands of it by putting it into a Statute. Further, of all Measures to put it into this is the least satisfactory. This is a re-housing Bill to deal with overcrowded areas, and is a most unsuitable Bill in which to include such a provision. It might easily mean that this Measure in certain areas would become a dead letter, and that the housing would continue to be carried on under previous Acts, which is not what any of us desire. By this discussion the Committee have in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
dicated to the local authorities their strong desire that nothing in the nature of the old tenements should be built in future and that the authorities should keep closely in mind the desirability of having playing spaces for children, of allowing the mothers to get downstairs easily with the children, of seeing that they are not cut off by the height of the stairs from access to the ground and various other small but very practical points such as the conveyance of "prams." It is impossible to incorporate all these matters in a Statute. An enlightened public opinion is the best means of pressing them home and the administrative responsibility of the Minister is the best method by which to enforce them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCRYMGEOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am gratified to learn from the Under-Secretary that the Department is now more inclined to support the intention of this new Clause. One remembers the position which was taken up only a few years ago when a deputation waited upon Lord Novar urging that as a much better class of house was being provided in England there was also a great necessity for improvement in Scotland. One of the strong points made then was that the type of house suggested would not stand the severity of weather conditions in Scotland. Now we are finding once again under these discussions that the Government are up against conditions which this Bill does not touch and cannot touch. The desirability of having a better type of house, especially the cottage type stipulated for in this New Clause involves an adjustment of conditions and requires getting down to root causes. We cannot throw the heavier part of the financial responsibility upon local authorities. They are severely burdened and they are faced with social conditions of a special kind, particularly in the large cities where it is proposed to allow 50 per cent. of the flatted type. Owing to these conditions it is necessary to have a larger percentage of the smaller class of houses. The very facts which make such a demand necessary prevent the Government for the time being at any rate from meeting the requirements of the new Clause in its entirety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulties which have developed in the discussion of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
subject brings one back to the point of defining the class of house required. I suggest that the proposal instead of being as printed on the Order Paper should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All houses to be erected for re-housing shall have separate entrances from the exterior of the building."</p></blockquote>
This debate has centred round questions about the stairs and the close. We have not been discussing the house as a house, but the stairs and the close leading to the house, and the argument has been as to the exact conditions in relation to the entrance. The ex-Under-Secretary spoke about other Acts of Parliament but he did not seem to remember that under certain Acts, which he included, tenements could not be built. Since we are dealing with people usually found in tenements and since we want to make a change from the idea of tenement life, the basic idea of construction ought to be that each dwelling house should have a separate entrance. Then there is the question of the number to the acre. If you take a house of three storeys for your ordinary flatted house—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A three storey building would be a tenement—counting the ground storey as one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is the first storey and the second storey. I am referring to these four-block flatted houses as we call them in Scotland, which have separate entrances and open spaces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Ground and first floor" they call it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we should give close attention to the question of separate entrances from the exterior and not from the close or stairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene in this discussion, but I feel bound to express the view that everybody who has any knowledge of local housing conditions in Scotland must agree with the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Dr. Forgan) in his idea that we ought to have a better type of house than those which we have been getting in the past. I live
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
in what is I think one of the newest tenements in the city of Glasgow, and while, undeniably, these are a big improvement on the old tenement house, yet for the man with a wife and family, particularly if they are living on the top flat, such a building is not a wholly desirable residence, even with the improvements which have been made. I know people living in such tenements with families of young children, and it is almost heartbreaking to watch them pulling heavy "prams" and carrying children up and down the stairs. Then on washing day the woman has to look after the washing of the clothes and drying them in the back court, and she has also to look after several young children in the flat, and she may have to run up and down stairs with the children or with heavy baskets of clothes several times a day. For those who have no children or only one child these tenements are not so bad, but for a young family, especially if they are living on the top flat, they are anything but desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Under-Secretary, if he cannot accept the new Clause in its entirety, at least to consider whether Parliament cannot exercise greater pressure than hitherto on the local authorities to try to get away from the tenement dwelling-house. No doubt, among the population, there is a great desire for tenement dwellings, but I hope that we are not going to continue building tenement dwellings merely because of that feeling. We ought to set ourselves to secure a better type of dwelling. As regards the flatted type, I have a little experience of the King's Park houses in Glasgow, which are of the flatted type, four to a block. I have not lived in one of them myself, but I have been in conversation with people who lived in them, and I did not find them very enthusiastic, while admitting that these houses were an improvement. I think the best type is that which the Glasgow Corporation built at Moss Park. We should get the best type of houses we can for this rehousing scheme, and I hope that the Under-Secretary for Scotland will try to get away from the tenement building altogether because even the best and most improved type of tenement building is, as I say, not yet a desirable kind of residence for the woman with a young family who cannot afford to send her washing to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1929-1930V000P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1179</span>
laundry and has to do it at home. I hope that even if he cannot accept the proposed new Clause in its entirety, the Under-Secretary will take stronger steps than have been taken in the past to press upon local authorities to go forward on the lines suggested by the hon. Member for West Renfrew.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. FORGAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Committee's indulgence to reply to one or two points which have been raised. My suggestion that except in the four largest cities in Scotland the houses to be built for rehousing should not be of the tenement type, is based on the belief that the actual cost of the construction of the cottage block type is little if anything greater than the cost of building tenements. Hon. Members opposite seem to differ from me on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major COLVILLE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear as to what is meant by the cottage block type.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SULLIVAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know quite well that the difference is only about £10 per house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. FORGAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving the actual cost out of account for the moment, my object is to prevent overcrowding in an area. This Bill is an attempt to prevent the overcrowding of areas. We want also to prevent overcrowding in areas, and it has been proved in Glasgow and Edinburgh that the infant mortality becomes lower and lower as the number of persons to the acre gets lower. That is a very important point. The Under-Secretary has informed us that actually in Scotland, under slum clearance schemes up to date, 51 per cent. of the houses provided have been of the tenement type. The majority of slum clearance operations in Scotland have been carried out in the larger cities, and all that I am asking, as regards the larger cities, is that there should be a limit of 50 per cent. of that type of houses. The Under-Secretary has told us that up to date the proportion has been 51 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might be persuaded to accept the assurance which the Under-Secretary has given if I could believe, as, unfortunately, I cannot, that for a large number of years he will be responsible for the control of housing policy in Scotland. I recollect only two years ago, in a part
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
of Lanarkshire represented in local government by the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Train), and as regards national government by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Pollok (Sir J. Gilmour) and the hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Major Elliot), what the local authorities were allowed to do. In the Lower Ward of Lanark, in a part of the country where there was any amount of open ground, they were allowed to build horrible tenements right on the road, with no pleasure grounds and no amenities at all. I personally regret that I cannot accept the Under-Secretary's assurance, and must press the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, before the Committee come to a decision, I may be allowed to say a word on two points that have been raised, although the matter has been very adequately discussed. As I have already said, it is impossible for us to accept in terms the words of this proposed new Clause, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. J. Welsh) has already said, it would mean that in some areas in Scotland we should literally get nothing done at all. There are areas in Scotland now where we have had tremendous difficulty in persuading the local authorities to build any houses at all, and I can assure my hon. Friend that we have still greater difficulty in getting them to build three-apartment houses, while there is even more difficulty still in getting them to build a big proportion of cottage houses. I am exceedingly anxious that, as the hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Major Elliot) has said, we should not unnecessarily tie our hands by terms in this Bill. I am perfectly certain that all that we can do is to exercise the maximum of pressure that is possible on every local authority to build the largest number of the cottage type of houses. I am very sorry that it is not possible for us to accept this Clause. While I can see the advantages, I think the disadvantages are still greater, of incorporating such a provision in terms in the Bill. If my hon. Friend will accept my assurance, not only on my own behalf and on behalf of the Secretary of State, but on behalf of the Department, that it is and has been for some time past our policy in every case to press for the maximum number of the cottage type of houses in the various schemes, that is all that we can really promise to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
