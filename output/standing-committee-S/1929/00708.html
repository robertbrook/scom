CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Power to make, adoption orders.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><ol>
<li>Upon an application in the prescribed manner by any person desirous of being authorised to adopt a child under the age of twenty-one years who has never been married, the Court may, subject to the provisions of this Act, make an order (in this Act referred to as "an adoption order") authorising the applicant to adopt that child.</li>
<li>A person so authorised to adopt the child and a child authorised to be adopted are in this Act referred to as an "adopter" and an "adopted child" respectively.</li>
<li>Where an application for an adoption order is made by two spouses jointly, the Court may make the order authorising the two spouses jointly to adopt, but save as aforesaid no adoption order shall be made authorising more than one person to adopt a child.</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out Sub-section (3).<br><br>
This is a point on which certain difficulties may arise, and if the Committee have any differences of opinion in regard to it I would rather drop my Amendment in order that the Bill may go through. While there may be certain technical points in the Bill, those technical points may never arise in practice, and I would rather that the Bill should go through, even to a certain extent imperfect, than that it should not go through at all. Later on, if we find that there are imperfections in the Bill, they might be put right by an amending Bill. I thoroughly agree with the principle of the Bill as applied to Scotland. The point that I am raising is that this Sub-section prevents two people from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1230</span>
adopting a child. That was, apparently, the English view. I am not satisfied that a couple of maiden ladies should not be allowed, jointly, to adopt a child, or that a brother and sister, jointly, should not be allowed to adopt a child. The question in regard to "jointly" raises a very difficult question in this respect that if you have the appointment of two spouses jointly and one spouse dies then, as I understand Scottish law, it would mean that the appointment would fail. If the survivor is a woman, I think that, quite clearly, she should be the adopter. If it was only a question of a woman, the matter would be easy of adjustment.<br><br>
No male person is to be allowed to adopt a female child, and I see the reason for that. In the case, for instance, of the wife dying and the husband being 35 or 40 years of age and the girl who has been adopted being, say, 15, I doubt very much the propriety of that man being the adopter of the child in those circumstances. That is why I doubt whether the Clause in these terms should have been put in. It would probably have been much better to allow the appointment of one person. That would mean that in the case of spouses, the spouse who asked to be the adopter would have to get the consent of the other spouse. I think the Clause as it stands will create a certain amount of difficulty, but I doubt whether we should adopt the drastic step of leaving out the Clause. I have, however, proposed my Amendment in order to raise my point. It would simply mean that the rest of the Bill would have to be remodelled, and that would be very difficult at this stage. Accordingly, having raised my point with regard to Sub-section (3), I do not propose to press for the deletion of the Sub-section unless the Committee are unanimously of that opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all recognise the weight of the statements made by the late Lord Advocate. All that I have to say is, that this Bill was drafted by the Scottish Federation of Societies affiliated to the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, and it was examined and approved by the National Council of Women and their Joint Committee on Legalised Adoption. In regard to the Clause as it appears in the Bill, the point raised by the right hon. and learned
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0613">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1231</span>
Member was not brought forward by those societies. The Bill is framed very closely on the English model, and the information that I have is that the English Act has been working very well, even with the Sub-section in which the right hon. Gentleman sees the possibility of difficulty. Therefore, those who have given the greatest possible attention to this matter have not found it necessary to contemplate the change indicated by the Amendment. On that ground, my advice to the Committee, although I am entirely in their hands, would be that the right hon. Gentleman should be allowed to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir JOHN GILMOUR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself, as a layman, inclined to complain, and I think the Committee have some reason for complaint, that there appears to be no effort on the part of the Law Officers to examine this Bill in its bearing on Scottish law. Of course, this is a private Member's Bill, but I observe that the Secretary of State for Scotland is present. I am a little surprised, from my knowledge of the working of the Scottish Office, that the Law Officers of the Crown have taken no interest in the matter. It is quite evident, from what my right hon. Friend the late Lord Advocate has said, that while this Bill has been drafted closely upon the analogy of the English Measure, everyone who knows the difference between Scottish law and English law knows perfectly well that a Bill so drafted is likely to cause considerable difficulty in administrative working. As the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Mathers) has said, the working of the English Act, which has been in operation for a short period, has shown no great difficulties, but, quite obviously, the time has not arrived when any competent judge can say whether these difficulties will not arise. In this Clause practical difficulties arise as to what will happen to the child in the event of the dissolution of the marriage, in case of divorce or the death of one of the parties. The child having been divested and taken away from its original parents and handed over to joint spouses, what is going to happen to the child? These are matters on which the Committee have a right to ask for some explanation. While I am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1232</span>
very anxious, as anxious as anyone, to see this Bill come into operation, I am a little disturbed as to how the Bill will work, and I am also disturbed that the Law Officers, who are responsible for seeing that Measures should go through the House in a reasonable and workable form, should have made no effort to scrutinise the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. William Adamson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been surprised at two things this morning. I am surprised at the speech which has been delivered by the right hon. Member for the Pollok Division (Sir J. Gilmour). His complaint is that the Law Officers of the Crown have taken no interest in this Bill. He says that although it is a private Member's Bill, they ought to have taken some interest in it. I do not know where he has got his information as to the Law Officers of the Crown having taken no part in the Bill. The very reverse is the case. Therefore, his complaint goes by the board. The next point is, that if there are so many legal technicalities that require to be attended to, the late Lord Advocate should have attended to them before last night, so that we might have had an opportunity of considering his Amendments. We had them in our hands this morning at ten o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. There are only a few verbal Amendments, more or less, which have been put in to-day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment we are discussing now was put on the Paper last night, and it appears for the first time this morning. Therefore, I would remind the right hon. Member for Pollok that he had better discuss with his own legal colleague some of the things that he was attempting to discuss with us, because his legal colleague has not given an opportunity to the Law Officers of the Crown or anybody else to try to find the significance of the Amendments that he is putting forward. I hope that the Committee will not accept the Amendment which has been proposed. I do not make any pretence to have legal knowledge. Looking at this part of the Bill from a common sense point of view, I think that the arrangement provided therein is an excellent arrangement, namely, that the husband and wife should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0614">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1233</span>
jointly adopt the child. Of course I have to take the opinion of legal men on these matters, but may I put this point? In the event of the husband dying, would not the remaining adopter be, in law, the guardian of the child?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will give way to me on this occasion, I will answer his point by saying that I do not think so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well. I think so, though I may be entirely wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. GILMOUR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then why have you not the Law Officers here?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Baronet knows very well that there are representatives of the Law Officers sitting in the room. It so happens that the Lord Advocate cannot be here himself, as he has to attend to a big court case in Edinburgh, but that does not mean that the Law Officers of the Crown are not represented, and the right hon. Baronet knows it. I hope that the Committee will not accept the Amendment of the right hon. and learned Gentleman the ex-Lord Advocate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DUNCAN MILLAR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one of those whose names appear on the back of this Bill, I agree with the Mover of the Amendment that we are all in full sympathy with the objects of the Bill and anxious to get it through. I suggest that he ought not to press this Amendment which seems to me to be rather drastic in form. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested that it might be better under this Bill, only to give power of adoption to one of the parties, instead of to the two spouses jointly. I am not clear that that would be a wise course. I think it is desirable in certain cases that the power should be a joint power and I suggest that Amendments might be made at a later stage to meet some of the difficulties raised by my right hon. and learned Friend. I suggest that he should withdraw the present Amendment to leave out Sub-section (3), and that we might consider, on its merits, the next Amendment on the Paper in his name which proposes to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that, should the marriage be dissolved by the death of the husband, the wife shall become the adopter, and should the marriage be annulled or dissolved in any other way the court shall, on the application
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1234</span>
of any party interested, reconsider the order and make such other order as it may think fit."</p></blockquote>
There are many other points in the Bill which, I think, justify full consideration. The Bill, as it stands, has been taken substantially from the English Act, but it deserves fresh consideration by the Scottish Members. I appreciate what the Secretary of State has said about the consideration already given to the Bill by the Law Officers, but I think the Lord Advocate might have been in his place to assist and advise us in connection with this Measure. It raises important legal questions and if the Lord Advocate has considered those questions, it is all the more his duty to be here and to give guidance to the Committee. We are, as I have said, very anxious to get the Bill and all I say is that it deserves careful consideration and some further amendment, in order to bring it more closely into line with Scottish ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the ex-Lord Advocate made a very serious allegation. The words which he used implied that in a case where a husband and wife adopted a child, and where the wife died, then on the death of the wife, a serious charge was liable to be made against the husband—a charge which was indicated in a sentence and which ought not to be repeated. We all know cases where children have been adopted as infants, and we know that affections grow up in such circumstances which are, in many instances, keener than if the child was the adopter's own child. Now we have the insinuation made by the ex-Lord Advocate that in a case of that kind, if a baby girl grew up to the age of 15, and if the wife died, the father should no longer be allowed to have the care or control of that child. It is a pity that he did not follow up that statement by telling us who was to be in charge of that child. If his Amendment were carried, what would happen to a child in a case of that kind where the wife died? Who is to step in and say where the child will be happiest and best looked after? [HON. MEMBERS: "The courts."] The right hon. Gentleman did not deal with that point. We should remember that we are dealing here with a question of affections and while I can understand the necessity for exercising great care as regards the adoption of children at the ages of 10, 12 or 15,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0615">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1235</span>
we ought to make provision for cases of the kind which I have described, in which great hardship may arise from such a proposal as that now made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the purpose of the Amendment is to remove the limitation which the Bill imposes on adoption by more than one person, except in the case of a husband and wife. I think it very desirable that adoption by unmarried persons should be encouraged. I think that it is one of the most beautiful things going on to-day, that single women who have passed the likely age for marriage are adopting children and giving those children happy homes, while bringing a great deal of happiness into their own lives. In the case of two sisters living together it seems a right and natural thing that they should be able to adopt a child jointly if they wish to do so. Sisters living together generally share everything, and they would probably wish to share what would become the most precious thing in life to them, namely, an adopted child. As it stands, the Bill seems to exclude that form of adoption, and only permits joint adoption in the case of a husband and wife. That is why I welcome the Amendment to leave out Subjection (3). Adoption is very much on the increase, and a peculiarity of recent years has been its extension among unmarried people. That is a most desirable thing. It brings new interests and a wider outlook into the lives of many single people, and in the case of many children it has meant that they have been brought into very happy homes. In the case of two sisters or two women friends living together, it does not seem to me desirable to say that only one of them can be the legal adopter of a child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee generally would like to see this Bill go through this stage to-day. Every Scottish Member is anxious that the privilege which has been given to England should, in some form or other, be extended to Scotland, and only questions of technicality and legal difficulty stand in the way. I am, naturally, sorry that the Lord Advocate is not here, but I am certain that he has given his personal attention to this Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1236</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course he has done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure he has, and I am certain that it is for some very good and justifiable reason that he is not here to-day. After all, this is a private Member's Bill, and, no doubt, on the Report stage we shall have the advantage of the presence of a legal representative of the Government. No doubt there is a good deal of substance in the Amendment before us, but as the right hon. and learned Gentleman asked the Committee to give him some guidance as to whether he should press his Amendment or not, I, speaking for those with whom I work and with whom I am associated, desire him not to press his Amendment at this stage I have a great deal of sympathy with the next Amendment in his name which proposes to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that, should the marriage be dissolved by the death of the husband, the wife shall become the adopter, and should the marriage be annulled or dissolved in any other way the court shall, on the application of any party interested, reconsider the order and make such other order as it may think fit."</p></blockquote>
I think it covers the point raised by the hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Hardie), who said that there was no provision in the Bill for looking after an adopted child, in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I pointed out that the ex-Lord Advocate's Amendment made no such provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member looks at the next Amendment on the Paper which has already been referred to, he will see that ample provision is made in it to meet that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is provision in the next Amendment, and of course guidance will be given by the courts in the ordinary way in such cases. I think there is a great deal to be said for the next Amendment, and I should like to ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether he intends to press it, and I should also like to ask the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Mathers) his intentions with regard to this later Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said, I am prepared to withdraw my Amendment to leave out Sub-section (3).</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the next Amendment in my name—at the end of Sub-section (3), to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that, should the marriage be dissolved by the death of the husband, the wife shall become the adopter, and should the marriage be annulled or dissolved in any other way the court shall, on the application of any party interested, reconsider the order and make such other order as it may think fit."</p></blockquote>
—I wish to say this: The Secretary of State has said that my view of the law is wrong, and no doubt the right hon. Gentleman has been properly advised in regard to that matter. In the circumstances, I am not going to press my Amendment. I shall put the responsibility on the Government for retaining the word "jointly," but I still maintain that if a joint appointment is made and if one of the parties dies, the appointment fails. I still think that some provision ought to be made for dealing with such cases either in the form of words which I have suggested or by the insertion of some such words as "or the survivor" after the word "jointly." You are putting the husband and wife in exactly the same position, and that may be what the Committee desire, but in view of the fact that the Secretary of State has said that the words which I propose are not required, I do not propose to press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want only to offer this little bit of advice. It is not competent to make speeches when an Amendment is not to be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely I am entitled to explain the reason why I do not move it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And surely I am entitled to give advice. If the right hon. and learned Member is not going to move it, it is no use taking up time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman not entitled to explain why he is not moving?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MILLAR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that in a previous discussion reference was made to this Amendment, is it not desirable that the matter should be made clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, especially as we are pressed for time.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1238</span>
It is not reasonable to do it, but if the right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to move the Amendment, I have no objection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the custom, with the consent of the Committee and the Chairman, for a Member to indicate that he is not going to move, and to give the Committee guidance as to why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already stated twice, no; it is not competent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you for your Ruling. The reason I am not going to move is in order that there should not be a discussion.</span></p>

<li>An adoption order shall not be made in any case where—</li>

<li>the applicant is under the age of twenty-five years; or</li>
<li>the applicant is less than twenty-one years older than the child in respect of whom the application is made:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Provided that, where the applicant and the child are within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, it shall be lawful for the Court, if it thinks fit, to make the order notwithstanding that the applicant is less than twenty-one years older than the child.</li></ul>
<li>An adoption order shall not be made in any case where the sole applicant is a male and the child in respect of whom the application is made is a female unless the Court is satisfied that there are special circumstances which justify as an exceptional measure the making of an adoption order.</li>
<li>An adoption order shall not be made except with the consent of every person or body who is a parent or guardian of the child in respect of whom the application is made or who has the actual custody of the child or who is liable to contribute to the support of the child:</li>
<ul>
<li>Provided that the Court may dispense with any consent required by this subsection if satisfied that the person whose consent is to be dispensed with has abandoned or deserted the child or cannot be found or is incapable of giving such consent or, being a person liable to contribute to the support of the child, either has persistently neglected or refused to contribute to such support or is a person whose consent ought, in the opinion of the Court and in all the circumstances of the case, to be dispensed with.</li></ul>
<li>An adoption order shall not be made upon the application of one of two spouses without the consent of the other of them:</li>

tion if satisfied that the person whose consent is to be dispensed with cannot be found or is incapable of giving such consent or that the spouses have separated and are living apart and that the separation is likely to be permanent.</li></ul>
<li>An adoption order shall not be made in favour of any applicant who is not resident and domiciled in Scotland or in respect of any child who is not a British subject and so resident.</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, <i>a</i>), after the word "is," to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or in the case of a joint application both applicants are"</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is to correct what is, obviously, a mistake in the English Measure. The Clause at present says:
<br><blockquote><p>"An adoption order shall not be made in any case where the applicant is under the age of twenty-five years."</p></blockquote>
How are you going to estimate the age of a joint application? The words I propose to insert are merely drafting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been closely examined by the Law Officers of the Crown, notwithstanding all the pro tests that we have had—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made no protest against the absence of the Lord Advocate. In fact, I said that he might be justifiably absent by some other important business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand that proviso. I am advised by the Law Officers that this Amendment can be accepted.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, <i>b</i>), after the first word "is," to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or in the case of a joint application both applicants are"</p></blockquote>
This is to the same effect as the last Amendment. I would like to say to the Secretary of State that I am glad the Law Officers examined these Amendments, which were put in only last night. I am glad to hear that they are both, in London and able to examine them.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Further Amendment made: After the word "applicant" ["where the applicant and the child"], insert the words "or one or other of the joint applicants."—[<i>Mr. MacRobert.</i>]</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1240</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "child" ["who is liable to contribute to the support of the child"], to insert the words, "and except with the consent of the child if a minor."<br><br>
In England, I understand, the Measure deals with children and infants who are under 21 years of age. The desire is to make the law of Scotland similar in regard to age, but it is a novel thing in regard to Scotland to force a minor child of 19 and 20, whether he consents or not, to be passed over to an adopter. That is a far-reaching proposal, and should not be done without the consent of the minor. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in Clause (3, <i>b</i>)
<br><blockquote><p>"the order if made will be for the welfare of the child, due consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the child."</p></blockquote>
I am quite satisfied that no court would ever sanction an adoption order if a minor child of 15 or 16 objected. Therefore, it may be that this Amendment is not required, although I should prefer the Bill with it in. If, however, there is any dissent at all, I hope that the Committee will not discuss it too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JAMES STEWART</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman speaks about a minor child of 15 or 16. Suppose the child is between seven and 10?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is then a pupil. A minor child is a girl over 12 and a boy over 14. These children are able to contract, and they are in a different position from pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MILLAR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is important, because we are dealing here not only with children in fact, but with persons up to 21 years of age, and we should be careful that the wishes of these young persons are consulted. As a matter of fact, when a child reaches the age of puberty, he is in a position to choose his residence under certain conditions, and we must make it clear that the rights of the child in this respect are safeguarded. I see no objection to putting in these words; they might make the Clause clear, because the words of Clauses (3, <i>b</i>) are evidently referable to children of more tender age as well, but in the case of minors, the law ought to be made perfectly clear and the right explicit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a promoter of the Bill, I accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is only fair that a girl of 12 or a boy of 14 should have the right to say whether a particular individual should be the adopter or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather doubtful about the age of 12, and perhaps between now and Report we might consider the age of 16. I can conceive, in regard to a child of 13, the Court, against the child's own will, saying that it should be adopted. I think that 12 in the case of a girl or 14 in that of a boy is a little too young. The age of puberty is too low in Scotland, and we must consider the age of 16.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the later age will not be adopted, and that the Amendment will be left as it is. It really meets the circumstances of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not withdraw his Amendment or modify its terms in regard to age. There are two important matters to keep in view here. The first is that, according to the law of Scotland, a minor has complete control of his own person, and we ought not in this Bill to do anything to infringe the law in regard to minors. The minor is entitled to make his will and do all kinds of things on his own, and in this matter he is entitled to the control of his own person. We must safeguard that. There still exists in the law of Scotland the process known as choosing curators. A girl of 12 or a boy of 14 is entitled to say who his guardian should be. You do not often come across such a case, and in my experience I have only once assisted a child to choose a curator. It is, however, a valuable right for the child to have.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subjection (3), after the word "has" ["dispensed with has abandoned'], to insert the words "neglected or treated with cruelty the child or has."<br><br>
This simply strengthens the powers of the court. In cases where the child has been abandoned or deserted, consent is not required; therefore, if the child has been neglected or treated with cruelty, consent also should not be required.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1242</span>
Later on the court has a general power to take any other circumstances into consideration. Therefore, unless the Committee are of opinion that the Amendment is desirable, I will not press it.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (5), to leave out the words, "and so resident."<br><br>
These words mean resident in Scotland. I can conceive of cases where a child who is a British child may be in England or Canada, and where it is desirable that that child may be adopted. The difficulty is that the child is of another country, and may be subject to the laws of that other country, which may not allow the child to leave the bounds of that country and come to Scotland. In most cases, probably, before an application is made to adopt a child that has been in England or Canada, the child, I think, would be brought to Scotland in the first place by those in charge of it, but I do not see any reason why these words should be in the Bill. If, however, there is any dispute in regard to the matter, they may remain in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As advised, I cannot ask the Committee to accept the Amendment. The Law Officers of the Crown advise me that there are certain difficulties that might well arise in the enforcement of any such order or the recognition of any such order by a foreign country where the child may reside. In the circumstances, therefore, I cannot advise the acceptance of the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DICKSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the situation not of the child resident abroad but of the child resident here whose parents die and the brother or sister of either of those parents may be resident in Canada? Does this Clause bar out the brother or sister adopting the child?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not rule out adoption by a brother or sister who happens to be in a foreign country. All they require to do is to ask the child to come to them and reside here a certain time and the difficulty is removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Secretary of State has said, with which I agree, I think that in practice the child will always be removed beforehand.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The word 'guardian' or 'guardians,' where occurring in this or in subsequent Sections, shall include 'curator' or 'curators.'"</p></blockquote>
This is really a drafting Amendment, and is necessary because the promoter of this Bill has imported into it the term "guardian," which is strictly applicable only to English law. Throughout the Bill where the term "guardian" is used, it ought to be used to include the case of any kind of person who has charge of a child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In another part of the Bill I am moving to alter the word "guardian" to "curator," but that is where "guardian" is definitely used in a legal sense. Here it is used in a general sense and the promoters consider that it is quite applicable and quite easily understood. As it does not here involve any legal interpretation, there is no need to make this Amendment at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. Member has said, I am quite willing to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

—(Matters with respect to which Court to be satisfied.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>The Court before making an adoption order shall be satisfied—
<ol>
<li>that every person whose consent is necessary under this Act and whose consent is not dispensed with has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which application is made, and in particular in the case of any parent understands that the effect of the adoption order will be permanently to deprive him or her of his or her parental rights; and</li>
<li>that the order if made will be for the welfare of the child, due consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the child, having regard to the age and understanding of the child; and</li>
<li>that the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person has made or given, or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption except such as the Court may sanction.</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out the word "permanently."<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1244</span>
This Amendment can only be understood by reading with it the other Amendment in my name—In Clause 5 (I), at the end, to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>b</i>) in any case where the adopter has died or has abandoned the adopted child, and has failed to make or leave adequate provision for the maintenance and education of the child, and where no other adoption order has been made, the right to custody and the obligation to educate and maintain the child shall revert to the parents of the child, without prejudice to any claim the parents or the child may have against the adopter or his estate for such maintenance and education."</p></blockquote>
The point is that in the case of an adopter dying or abandoning the adopted child, is that child to be thrown on the parish or is it to go back to its parents? One view is that it is desirable that when you have an adoption, that child should be as completely as possible severed from all relations with its former parents. The severance is not complete, because at all stages the child is still the child of its own parents. But my point is that where you have a child abandoned or the adopter dies, what is the position of that child? If the child is adopted by someone else, no question arises. If the person who dies leaves adequate provision for the education and maintenance of the child, no question arises. In neither of those cases does it go back to the parents. Only in the case referred to in my Amendment does any question arise, and in those circumstances is the child to be a derelict and thrown on the parish, or is it to go back to its natural parents? I consider it more desirable that it should go back to its parents, and this Amendment starts a series of Amendments that would effect that result. If there is any difference of opinion, I think the Committee should not approve this Amendment but should, after experience, pass another Bill later on if it were found that this Bill did not work satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the effect of this Amendment would be to realise what the right hon. Gentleman wishes to do, because if you take out "permanently" you are not going to retain the right of the child to maintenance or dependence on the parents afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Member referred to the later Amendment?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1245</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not, but what I say is that if "permanently" remains in, that child retains all his rights of dependence on the parents. If the adopter dies and the child becomes dependent on the parish, then the parish will hold the parents responsible for the maintenance of the child. I do not think that by the act of adoption subsequent dependence on the parents will be ruled out. I do not see anything in the Bill to suggest that that is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the case—Clause 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am doubtful still of Clause 5 and the effect of the adopter dying. The adoption will not lapse with the death of the adopter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir FREDERICK THOMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the importance of the considerations that have been put forward by the right hon. Member for East Renfrew (Mr. MacRobert), but I think it would be well for the Committee not to accept this Amendment. This matter was considered very carefully by the Tomlin Committee, which presented a unanimous report on which the English Bill was founded. They said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We think that adoption should operate to take from the natural parent and transfer to the adopting parent all those rights, duties and liabilities in relation to guardianship, custody and maintenance which the natural parent has or is under <i>vis-a-vis</i> the child or <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Poor Law or any other Public Authority, including the right or duty in relation to such matters as consent to marriage during infancy, and that so far as the child is concerned he should in all similar respects stand to the adopting parent in the position which before the adoption he occupied in relation to his natural parent."</p></blockquote>
That Committee was strongly of opinion that it should be the law that in all questions of custody, maintenance and education the adopted parent and child should come together as far as any relationship can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will see his way to withdraw the Amendment. The Committee is very doubtful about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be ready to withdraw it, but I want to point out that certain Members of the Committee are under a misapprehension. The hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) said that the obligation on the parent would revive. That is not so under the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1246</span>
Bill. I do not challenge the Tomlin Report. I am only seeking to provide for the one case of a derelict child where no other provision is made, but, in view of the difference of opinion in the Committee, I will withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p>(3)An adoption order shall not deprive the adopted child of any legal rights competent to him in the estate of his parents or of any right to or interest in property to which, but for the order, the child would have been entitled under any intestacy or disposition, whether occurring or made be fore or after the making of the adoption order, or confer on the adopted child any right to or interest in property as a child of the adopter, and the expressions "child," "children," and "issue" where used in any disposition whether made before

or after the making of an adoption order, shall not, unless the contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or children or the issue of an adopted child.</p>
<p>(4)Where an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child takes any interest in heritable or moveable property under a disposition by the adapter, or where an adopter takes any interest in heritable or moveable property under a disposition by an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, any succession, legacy or other duty which becomes leviable in respect thereof shall be payable at the same rate as if the adopted child had been a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock.</p>
<p>(5)For the purposes of this section "disposition" means a deed, instrument or writing whether inter vivos or mortis causa whereby property is conveyed or under which a succession arises.</p>
<p>(6)For the purposes of the enactments relating to friendly societies, collecting societies and industrial assurance companies, which enable such societies and companies to insure money to be paid for funeral expenses, and which restrict the persons to whom money may be paid on the death of a child under the age of ten, the adopter shall be deemed to be the parent of the child; and where before the adoption order was made any such insurance had been effected by the natural parent of the child, the rights and liabilities under the policy shall by virtue of the adoption order be transferred to the adopter, and the adopter shall, for the purposes of the said enactments, be treated as the person who took out the policy.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the word "or" ["parent or parents"].<br><br>
I do not see the point in putting in "parent or parents" and "guardian or guardians," because it seems to me that "parent" includes "parents" and "guardians" includes "guardian." It is a mere matter of drafting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that this series of Amendments would not fit in with the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In these circumstances, I will not press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), after "1929," to insert the words "and Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925."<br><br>
I could not add to what has been said by the hon. Member for South Aberdeen (Sir F. Thomson), who, in better language than I could have used, and by the quotation he made from the report, has justified the putting of this Amendment into the Bill. He made a statement that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1248</span>
the child should stand to the adopted parent as it would to its natural parent, as far as possible. I know of two or three cases where a husband and wife have adopted a child, and the husband, unfortunately, has been killed in the mine, and although the widow was prepared to carry on her responsibility to the adopted child, under the existing Workmen's Compensation Act she was not entitled to any allowance for the child. All that I am asking in this Amendment is that where a child has been adopted it shall have the same rights as far as the Workmen's Compensation Act is concerned as are provided for a child living with its natural parents. I think there is unanimity in regard to this matter, or I hope there is, and I trust that the Amendment will be accepted. It may be necessary to make a slight alteration in the proviso, but that will not be difficult to adjust on the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am opposed to this Amendment for the reason that it seeks to deal with a general public Act. The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1925 is not the only Act where the rights of children are affected. It is very inappropriate to seek to insert in a Scottish Bill an Amendment different from any provision in the English Bill, affecting a general Statute. It seems to me to be impossible to put in an Amendment of this character, which would have far-reaching effects and would only apply in the case of Scotland, with respect to an Act which applies both to England and Scotland. Therefore, I think the Amendment ought to be resisted. I should have no objection to a reconsideration of the matter in another Bill which would deal both with England and Scotland, and would enable the question of the Workmen's Compensation Act and other Acts to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be appropriate for me to explain the position of those who are responsible for this Bill being drafted. I agree with the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood) that the human case for this Amendment stands out very clearly, but those who are responsible for the Bill being promoted are apprehensive, on the grounds of pure expediency, of the effect of including an important provision of this kind in this Bill. It is recognised that other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0622">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1249</span>
Acts and other provisions safeguarding the interests of children might reasonably be included. The question of employers' liability is another thing which might be taken into consideration. Those who are responsible for the Bill fear the danger of losing the modified provisions in this Bill with regard to adopted children, by the giving to them of a legal status, and they desire that the Bill should not be loaded to the extent of having this particular Amendment made. I should have been happy if the Amendment could have been accepted with no danger to the final enactment of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DICKSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel very strongly with the Mover of the Amendment that as regards anything arising out of accidents the rights which the ordinary parent has for recovery ought to be passed on to the parents-in-law, as these people who adopt children will become, but I am afraid that this Amendment is not wide enough to achieve that purpose, even if it were adopted. The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, is only a very narrow part of the legislative machinery in regard to the recovery of compensation and damages for accident or death. For example, the Amendment leaves out the very important alternative of suing employers under the Employers' Liability Act. Before an Amendment of this kind, or anything aiming at its purpose is adopted, it requires more consideration. Whether it be wise to introduce the Amendment into the Bill I cannot say, but if the principle ought to be adopted it ought to be a comprehensive principle, which gives every right to the legal parent and not a limited right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. HENDERSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood) referred to those who are responsible for the Bill. His name is at the back of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment proposes to introduce something that is not in the English Act, and it refers to another Act of Parliament. We are all much concerned about the human side of the question, but an Amendment of this kind might lead to certain complications unless it were thoroughly explored in the first instance. I suggest to my hon. Friend that he should withdraw his Amendment and consider the matter between now and the Report stage, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1250</span>
order that there may be a further discussion on the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member will not withdraw the Amendment. It is very important that in this Committee, where Scottish opinion is represented, we should deal with this matter before the Bill goes back to the House. I am not convinced by what was said by the right hon. and learned Member for East Renfrew (Mr. MacRobert) with regard to our dealing with a public general Act. The Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts have been applied in the English Measure in this respect although it has not yet been applied to Scotland. Adopted children in England are protected with regard to the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts, but there being no adopted children in Scotland the same right has not yet been given to the children in Scotland. If in connection with the Workmen's Compensation Act we go a little further than the English Act, we are giving the best possible ground for helping the children in England who have been denied this right. There will be a sufficiently strong case that something in this direction should be done for the children in England, seeing that we have done it for the children in Scotland, just as we are now saying: "Why should the children in Scotland be deprived of a privilege with regard to the Contributory Pensions Act which has been given to the children in England?"<br><br>
In this Bill we are extinguishing the rights of certain parents with respect to their children. We are handing those children over to people who have adopted them, and yet this very important right in regard to provision for the child arising out of the health and well-being of the father who has adopted that child, in connection with accidents while at work, is being withheld from the child, until we have had time to look up the matter from the point of view of Great Britain and to produce an amending Statute. No one, in sense, could adopt any such view. Here is a need that every one will admit ought to be satisfied. If the provision was not put in the English Act it was because of an oversight. Surely, the fact that an oversight has happened in England is not a good reason for leaving out this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1251</span>
provision so far as the rights of children in Scotland are concerned. When the right hon. and learned Member for East Renfrew has been a little longer in the House he will not be so optimistic in regard to the possibilities of future legislation. I hope that we Scottish Members are going to seize the opportunity of dealing with this matter and of giving to the children in Scotland something of which the children in England have been deprived, and thereby we shall be helping the children in England in regard to their own Measure. This is a Bill dealing with the rights of children who are to be adopted and we have no right to limit the rights that those children would have had in respect of their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLVILLE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words from the point of view of an employer of labour. The welfare of the workers is dealt with not by one Act but by a whole code of Acts, and if this Amendment were accepted it would lead to considerable confusion, by selecting one particular Act, the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, and applying it to this Bill. I do not want to close my mind to the question being considered on a general basis. I think it should be dealt with nationally rather than locally. The human element has been stressed in regard to the Amendment. That element does not exist on one side of the Committee only, as has been evident by the smooth passage of the Bill so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I would like to know why the hon. and gallant Member speaks as an employer of labour and not as a representative of a constituency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that is not a point of Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLVILLE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am entitled as an employer of labour to put my point of view. I repeat the statement that I am speaking as an employer of labour, and I am not in the least ashamed of it. As an employer of labour, I am entitled to point out the difficulties which would arise in the administration of this Act if it were passed with this Amendment inserted, and references to other Acts were left out. I recognise what has been said about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1252</span>
taking away legal rights from a child by removing it from its parents and putting other people into the virtual position of parents, but the Amendment as it stands would not meet the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss RATHBONE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reasonable inference from what has been said by the hon. and gallant Member is that those responsible for the Bill should endeavour to bring forward on the Report stage an Amendment which would cover other Acts, because on general principles it does seem clear that as far as employers' liabilities are concerned, using the word in the broader sense, it makes no difference to the employer whether he incurs liability on behalf of children who live with their own parents or in regard to adopted children. If the real parent has forfeited his right in that respect, it removes some part of the liability from the employers, but there is no reason why the employer should profit from this Bill. I do not wish to labour the matter, but I think there is something in the objection which has been raised to the Amendment that the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, is only one of several Acts which should be indicated in this-connection. I suggest that the remedy is to supply the names of the other Acts and not to insert one only. That might be done by an agreed Amendment—an Amendment agreed upon, at any rate, as far as those responsible for the Bill tare concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MARCUS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the result which the Amendment seeks to achieve is desirable and worthy of support but there is a much wider question involved. In my view the Amendment is not comprehensive enough and will lead to no end of difficulty, complaint and discontent. The proposal is to apply the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, to all the children referred to in the Clause, but no reference is made to the Employers' Liability Act or to the law of succession or to the common law or many other similar laws to which the children mentioned in this Bill are bound to become related as the years go on. If an attempt is to be made to extend the rights at present vested in these children, obviously a separate Measure is necessary. In actual practice the Amendment means that if a father is injured and there is a liability on the part of the employer under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1253</span>
1925, payment will be made in respect of each of the man's dependants, but if the claim is excluded from the Workmen's Compensation Act, if it comes under the Employers' Liability Act, or if there is a common law accident outside those Acts altogether, there will be no claim in respect of the child in such circumstances. Obviously, there would be injustice and unfairness if such cases were to arise. Not because I am hostile to the spirit which animates the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood), but because of the legal difficulties which will arise, and because of my desire to deal with the matter comprehensively, I am bound to oppose the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady the Member for the English Universities (Miss Rathbone) and also with the last speaker. Could not the Government bring in a Clause covering the points made by the two last speakers, without wrecking the Bill? I do not want the Bill to be wrecked, but if some Amendment such as I suggest could be brought in on the Report stage, I think there would be agreement that Scotland should once more lead England in this matter, where she has been following England up to now. But we have to consider the risk of wrecking the Bill. This is a great chance and nobody wants to protect employers or anybody else by means of this Measure. We are only looking for the welfare of the child and if we cannot secure this Amendment otherwise, do not, at any rate, let us imperil the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MILLAR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A substantial point is raised by the Amendment which deserves further consideration, but I would strongly urge that it should be withdrawn at this stage with a view to the whole matter being fully gone into later. In answer to the ex-Lord Advocate's contention that we are going further in this Bill than in the case of the English Act, may I point out that the English Act has no provision whatever for dealing with the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act. It may be that subsequent Statutes have been passed dealing with the matter but, in point of fact, the question has not yet been determined as far as England is concerned in relation to the adoption law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it has. I understand that, in the latest Act, pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1254</span>
vision is made that for the purposes of that particular pension, an adopted child under the English Act will be treated as a person entitled. It is because we had not a Scottish adoption Measure at that time, that a reference to Scotland in the same connection does not appear. In this Clause we are really assimilating the law of Scotland to that of England in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MILLAR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept what my right hon. and learned Friend has said, but my point is that we are dealing here with a matter of enormous importance to the children whose rights are going to be curtailed in regard to their ordinary relations with their parents. They are to have those rights transferred and affected as far as the adoption order is concerned, and we must see to it that they are completely safeguarded in regard to all the various aspects of the various claims which may arise in respect of children. I do not think that the hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Marcus) is correct in his suggestion that the law of succession arises, because in Sub-section (3) it is made clear that:
<br><blockquote><p>"An adoption order shall not deprive the adopted child of any legal rights competent to him in the estate of his parents or of any right to or interest in property to which, but for the order, the child would have been entitled under any intestacy or disposition."</p></blockquote>
But we are certainly dealing with other claims which should be determined in relation to the new law, and I therefore urge that the matter should be carefully considered before the Report stage in order that we may get an agreed Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCRYMGEOUR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a wonder that this matter was not gone into at an earlier stage. We have seen that there are other aspects of this very important question besides that mentioned by the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood). I wish to know from the Secretary of State what is the position of the Government on this question. Do they stand by the Bill as it is, or do they intend to take any steps to meet the various points which have been raised? If the interests of the adopting parties are to be left out in a matter of this kind it is a very serious defect in the Bill. This point would need to be clearly established. The hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) has pointed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1255</span>
out that we ought not to lose any opportunity of dealing with this question and even if they have been overlooked in the case of England, we ought to have these things made right in regard to Scotland. These are aspects of the question which ought to be settled now while the Bill is going through this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MATHERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made reference previously to those outside Parliament who were responsible for the promotion of this Bill, and I wish again to try to explain what is in their mind with regard to matters of the kind raised in the Amendment. If the Bill becomes an Act, as I hope it will, there will be two Acts dealing with adoption, one rigidly applied to England, and the other rigidly applied to Scotland. Following on the passage of the Scottish Measure it will be necessary, in the opinion of those interested in this matter, that there should be what may be described as a bridging Act uniting the two and making the law on adoption common to the whole of Great Britain. It seems to me that such a Measure will require to be introduced very soon after Scotland has had its adoption law established, and then there would be an opportunity of referring in a general comprehensive way, which would be applicable to the whole country, to these other Statutes which have been mentioned in addition to the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tradeston (Mr. T. Henderson) asked me a very straight question at the beginning of this debate. He asked why I as one of the backers of the Bill, had put down an Amendment to the Bill. The hon. Member happens to be a member of the Government and he knows that even Governments sometimes improve Bills by making Amendments in them after they have been introduced. I was not responsible for bringing in this Bill, though I backed the principle of the Bill and I may frankly say that I am more than pleased with the reception which my Amendment has received. There has not been a single word of hostile criticism against the principle of the Amendment with the exception, shall I say, of one speaker who suggested the possibility of wrecking the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that when you are dealing with public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1256</span>
Statutes such as the Workmen's Compensation Act, you must have the two laws the same. You are not giving any additional advantage to the child by the Amendment. You are taking away from him one right and giving him another and it is a case of six and half-a-dozen as to which is the more valuable. The adopter of the child may not suffer an accident, but the child's own father may, and under the present law the child would be entitled under the Workmen's Compensation Act in that case. It does not seem to me that you are giving any additional benefit to the child but my main objection is that if you put in these words Scotland will be affected in a different way from England and I think exception will be taken to that course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the fact that the Amendment would involve some difference in Scottish law as compared with English law, but, since 1926, Scotland has been at a disadvantage in this respect because England has got an Adoption of Children Act and Scotland has not, and children in Scotland to-day are being denied benefits under the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Pensions Act until we get this Measure through. But keen as I am on getting the benefit for the children which would arise from this Amendment I have not desire to wreck the Bill. We have had absolute unanimity I would point out as to getting for adopted children all the benefits of moneys which come from the public Exchequer. We only find hostility when it is thought that private enterprise is being compelled to provide for the rights of these adopted children [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLVILLE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say what hostility he has had to-day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hostility on the part of the late Lord Advocate, who points out all the difficulties because we are trying to get something through the public Acts for the adopted children. I am prepared to admit the strength of the case for the wisest interprepation possible, and I believe that the principles outlined in the report, part of which was read by the hon. and learned Member for South Aberdeen (Sir F. Thomson), are right principles that ought to be incorporated in this Bill. A child, when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1257</span>
once adopted, should have all the benefits of the ordinary child. I have received an assurance from the Secretary of State that this will receive serious consideration between now and the Report stage. On the Report stage, however, I will submit the same Amendment, unless words can be framed to bring in the widest interpretation for the benefit of these children. I am prepared to argue it again on the Report stage, and the promoters of the Bill will have to face this particular responsibility in the interests of these children. I am not going to be browbeaten even by the promoters of the Bill. If it will help us to get on with the Bill, I will withdraw the Amendment, with the assurance of the. Secretary of State that the matter will receive serious consideration between now and the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BARR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a difference between the words that fell from the main promoter of the Bill and the promise that something may be done before the Report stage, because the principal promoter of the Bill spoke of a special Measure to be brought in later. That is a very perilous and distant expedient. We know how difficult it is to get through any legislation. Therefore, I hope that this will receive serious consideration by the Secretary of State, because it will lead to extreme disappointment in Scotland if we exclude the Workmen's Compensation Act and other Acts that may be brought in. Someone has said that it will mean overloading the Bill, and that there might be a danger even of wrecking the Bill, but if there is a chance of unanimity with regard to a wide enough Clause, there need be no talk of losing the Bill. We shall miss a great opportunity if we do not seriously give our minds to making a proper Clause to include this Act and other Acts. The main purpose of the Bill is to include the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts, and why should we not have a Clause that will cover other Acts? I am not impressed with this idea that we should not get out of step with England. England, in this matter, has gone a little ahead of us, and in this matter and other matters we should have legislation which, if need be, will set the step for England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will not withdraw the Amendment. If he does, I shall move it. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1258</span>
hon. Members are so convinced that the rights of these children under the Employers' Liability Acts and other Acts should remain, they should put down Amendments to that effect. Here is an important Amendment, and I do not intend to be a party to allowing it to go to the House without the Committee having taken a definite decision on it. Let us take the first step, and retain for these children all the rights of children who have their own parents. If we take the first step, it will be an added argument when the Bill goes to the House. I hope that the Committee will accept the Amendment, and on the Report stage we can include the other Amendments as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKINLAY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood) will call the bluff of those who have suggested that there are tremendous legal difficulties in the way. It is suggested that the Bill will be killed. Who is going to kill the Bill? All hon. Members have said that an adopted child should have the same legal rights as an ordinary child. It is strange that if you impose all the rigours of the law on the person who adopts the child, the adopted child shall be ruled out so far as succession is concerned. If the Amendment is adopted, the Bill will be killed in another place, whose definite object and purpose in the constitution of this country is to protect the rights of vested interests. Consequently, I hope that the hon. Member for Peebles will have a vote on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the last speaker includes among those whose bluff is to be called some of us who have given as clear an indication as we can where we stand on this important point. I pointed out earlier in the discussion that there were some difficulties with regard to the Amendment which we require to examine, and that I advised the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood) to withdraw his Amendment so as to allow us, between now and the Report stage, to examine these difficulties, and to see whether they were of such a character as would prevent us from putting in the Amendment. He is willing to do that, but evidently there are some Members on the Committee who are not prepared to allow him to withdraw his Amendment on these conditions. I want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1259</span>
to say to the hon. Member for Partick (Mr. McKinlay), particularly, that I am as keen for this to be arranged if it is possible to arrange it. I am as anxious as any other Member of this Committee if it can be safely arranged, but I do not want to see the Bill wrecked. I want to say to those on the other side of the Committee that if it is found possible to include it on the Report stage, I hope that they are not going to take up any attitude that will wreck the Bill. I appeal to my hon. Friends on the Committee to accept the position which I have advised the hon. Member for Peebles to accept, and to allow the Amendment to be withdrawn on the distinct understanding that this matter will be thoroughly examined with a view to seeing whether it is possible to include the Amendment. The interests of the children will not be prejudiced by that careful examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. FORGAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An hon. Member suggested that the Bill would be wrecked and that we should avoid overloading it, but I agree with the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) that the first step towards including all the Measures that might be included is to include this one, and I hope that the Committee will accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) will withdraw his opposition to the withdrawal of this Amendment, which covers only one Act. He may do a tremendous amount of harm, because it is common knowledge that a number of people who have adopted children get grants from certain trusts in such places as Glasgow. I am sure that it is not the intention of the promoters of the Bill to make an adopted child or his adopted parents better off than the ordinary child and parents. I take it that the intention is to make this child as well off as a child brought up by its own parents, and not to make it better off or to make it worse off. I was present yesterday at one of the trusts of which I spoke, when thousands of pounds were distributed to people who had given hospitality to adopted children. If there came along a child whose adopted parents had a privilege under the Amendment, it would be ruled out, for it would have certain privileges that no other child has. If we

accept the suggestion of the Secretary of State to bring in a comprehensive Measure to cover the Compensation, Employers' Liability, and other Acts, we shall put all the children on one level. We are only cheese-paring by insisting on this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole idea behind this Bill and other Measures that pass the House of Commons is that if Scotland wants anything, it must wait until England gets it. We have had too much of that. Scotland is not going to lose its identity if I can help it. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HARDIE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why should Scotland wait until England has got the thing through? The position has always been for Scotland to be dragged at the heels of England, and I object to it. This weakness that is being shown means that we have got to fight for this position. I, for one, am not going to submit to being dragged at the heels of England in legislation. There is no need for it, either mentally or physically. It will be a great instruction to get people who understand the Scottish position by being Scottish people and Scottish born, and we are not likely to be moved by anything American or anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me wrong that Scotsmen, brought up on the Bible, should talk as if God had not made all nations of one blood. I do think it is a pity that there should be all this talk of class consciousness. I did hope that when I got amongst Scotsmen—Presbyterians and the rest—we could at least get our Bill dealing with children without class-conscious feeling and waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I indicated that there were certain matters in which I thought the Bill should be altered, but that I would not press anything if I found it was going to be contentious. A Bill that becomes contentious will, in fact, have to stand over. Accordingly, I have withdrawn Amendment after Amendment. Some of my hon. Friends opposite think this particular Amendment is a good Amendment and others think it is not appropriate for the Bill at this time. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Marcus) has pointed out the legal difficulties. I do put it to the

Committee that what we want is to have an Adoption Bill put on the Statute Book as quickly as possible. If we can get the substantiate, why not take the sub-stantials? If there is any discussion on this Bill, either on Report or Third Reading, I do not believe it will pass, because I do not think the Government have got time to pass it. I do put it to the hon. Member for Peebles (Mr. Westwood) that when we have withdrawn Amendments he should do so, too. I do not object to it being considered by the Secretary of State at a later stage, but, if he does propose something, then I hope it will be unanimous, because if it raises discussion and contention, I do not think we shall get this Bill. I appeal to hon. Members opposite to allow this Amend-</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "adopter," to insert the words, "except for maintenance and education as aforesaid."<br><br>
This Amendment is to make quite clear that the adopted child will have a claim against the estate of the adopter for maintenance and education. It is clear that the adopter, while alive, has the duty and obligation to maintain and educate the child, but it is not equally clear that that duty would be against the estate of the adopter after his death. This Amendment is to make quite sure of that and deals with the right of succession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by the Law Officers that this Amendment is quite unnecessary, and that it is undesirable to introduce it here. The object of the Amendment is already provided for in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Law Officers have really considered this, it seems to me difficult how they have found time,</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1262</span>
<p>ment to be withdrawn on the suggestion of the Secretary of State that he will consider the matter. There is plenty of precedent for withdrawing Amendments in this Committee. I have withdrawn about a dozen myself.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have agreed to withdraw so that a wider Clause may be brought in, and unless that is done the responsibility will not be mine for wrecking the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STEPHEN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By passing this to-day we are accepting the principle, and we are not wedded to this form of words.</span></p>
<p>Question put, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 16: Noes, 10.</p>
<p>because I put this Amendment down late last night. Still, on the footing that they really have considered it, I am prepared not to press it.</p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section, (3), after the word "issue," to insert the words "of any person."<br><br>
This Amendment deals with a very technical piece of draftsmanship. I put this Clause to a very eminent English King's Counsel, and asked him to read it and see if he could understand it. He said he could not. and that it was nonsense. Whether or not the particular Amendments I propose effect the result I desire, I do not know, but I think they do. The Clause says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the expressions 'child,' 'children,' and 'issue' where used in any disposition whether made before or after the making of an adoption order, shall not, unless the contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or children or the issue of an adopted child."</p></blockquote>
Suppose I left my child a legacy and that child had been adopted by the Secre-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1929-1930V000P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1263</span>
tary of State, that child of mine would be an adopted child. Therefore, my disposition would not be effective because it was an adopted child. That was never intended, and that is not what it means. I think it means that the expressions "child," "children," and "issue" of any person where used in any disposition shall not, unless the contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or the issue of an adopted child of that person. I think those words would make it intelligible. It appears very ambiguous at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member is raising a point, but he is not putting it in the right way, as I am advised. If he would put "in relation to any person," I am advised that it would be in better form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would then read:
<br><blockquote><p>"the expressions 'child,' 'children' and 'issue' in relation to any person."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. GILMOUR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move," That the Committee do now adjourn."<br><br>
As this is not a question where the right hon. Gentleman has been able to be advised by the Law Officers of the Crown, perhaps it would be well that the Committee should adjourn until he gets that advice. I am at a loss to understand why material points of this kind should not have been considered by the Law Officers of the Scottish Office. I think that the Committee have a right to complain of the manner in which they have been treated during the whole of this sitting. The right hon. Gentleman has claimed repeatedly that he has been advised by the Law Officers. There is a difference between being advised by the Law Officers and by his very expert staff. He may get the most expert advice from his staff, but the fact remains that he has repeatedly said that he was advised by the Law Officers of the Crown, when it was within the knowledge of the Committee that he could not have been so advised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want again to protest against what has been said by the right hon. Gentleman. He has twice stated that the Lord Advocate is absent. I have explained the reason for his absence. I have pointed out that where the Lord Advocate had an opportunity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1264</span>
of considering the Amendments on the Order Paper they have been considered, and I have put his views as clearly as I possibly could to the Committee. There were, however, a number of Amendments that it was impossible to consider as carefully as others, but that was through no fault of the Law Officers of the Crown, or the legal advisers. I notice the right hon. Gentleman makes a distinction between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. GILMOUR</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I do. There is a very material distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither the Law Officers nor the legal advisers had an opportunity of carefully considering certain Amendments, because they were put on the Order Paper only last night, and we got possession of them at ten o'clock this morning. There was not much time to consider them between 10 and 11 o'clock. Therefore, the matter rests with the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. They should have put their Amendments on the Order Paper in time if they wanted them to be carefully considered. I have no objection to the adjournment of the Committee now, because it is evident that we shall not be able to finish the Bill to-day. I had hoped that we should have been able to dispose of the Bill to-day, but that is impossible after the lengthy discussion on the last Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacROBERT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say, in reply to the right hon. Gentleman, that I am not complaining of the absence of the Lord Advocate. He may be away for good and sufficient reasons. What I object to is that it is now admitted that this Clause does require Amendment. That being so, why was it not scrutinised by the Law Officers? The suggestion is made that I am to blame because I was diligent enough to put Amendments on the Order Paper last night. The necessity for these Amendments ought to have been detected by the Law Officers of the Crown or the skilled advisers of the right hon. Gentleman. It is not for the right hon. Gentleman to blame me because I put in certain Amendments last night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a Motion before the Committee, and the right hon. Gentlemen are discussing quite a different

<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
