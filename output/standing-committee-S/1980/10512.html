	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that .the Committee have considered the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
Before speaking to the Bill Mr. Henderson, I extend what I am sure are congratulations from the whole Committee on your appointment to the Chairman's Panel, and I hope that you find this morning to be a suitable example of the height of activity over which you will have to preside in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will, I believe, command the support of both sides of the Committee and, indeed, of the vast majority of people in Scotland. It has two main objectives. First, it provides certain occupancy rights for the spouses of a marriage. In the event of the breakdown of that marriage a spouse will be able to seek the approval of the court to occupy the matrimonial home. Secondly, it deals with the particular problem of domestic violence and, indeed, with what is often known as the case of the battered wives. It gives a certain extra protection, that has not been available until now, for those who have experienced violence, or fear violence from a spouse and so seek the court's protection with regard to the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is drafted in terms of complete neutrality between the sexes, as would be appropriate at present, but in effect it means a considerable shift in the balance towards the interests of the wife, as it is normally she who has been the person who loses out as a consequence of a marriage breakdown, either because the matrimonial home has been in the name of the husband only or because any questions of potential violence to her or to the children are more common than those of violence towards the husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actual incidence of domestic violence is, by definition, a statistic which is impossible to show with a degree of certainty. Clearly, in many cases where domestic violence has taken place wives have, over the years, been reluctant to give information either to friends and neighbours, or, more importantly, to the police, and so it is a phenomenon which, to some extent, can only be assumed rather than stated definitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no doubt that the bulk of domestic violence which takes place has been directed towards the wife rather than towards other members of the household. A survey taken in Edingburgh and Glasgow in 1974 showed that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
incidents of domestic violence 70 per cent, had been directed towards the wife and only 10 per cent, had been directed towards the children of the marriage. Even though 10 per cent, is an appalling figure in respect of violence towards children, the figures show that it is the spouse, and in particular the wife, who has been the person most subject to domestic violence as a consequence of various social attitudes and habits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, those habits have, in part, been due to the traditional domination of the husband as head of the household. A belief that has persisted until recent years is that in some circumstances the husband was entitled to exercise a degree of physical chastisement in relation to his wife quite apart from the normal chastisement that parents might exercise towards their children. Values and standards have changed considerably over the years, but it is a matter of great regret that, even in modern times, there is a degree of physical injury exhibited towards wives in particular. Therefore, it is appropriate that protection should be provided, and the Bill is, I believe, an important contribution towards dealing with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the years, criminal law has been able to provide protection to a spouse who has experienced or fears the exercise of physical threats. But, for obvious reasons, wives have been reluctant to bring in the police or the prosecuting authorities. For that reason, it is important that the improvement of the civil remedies are available to a spouse, and should be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is based on a draft Bill, produced by the Scottish Law Commission, which was published last July. Hon. Members who took part in the Standing Committee on the Criminal Justice Bill will recall pressing the Government to take urgent action when the Commission's report was published. I gave an assurance then that the Government considered that those proposals should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. I think that both sides of the Committee will agree that the Government have fully met the terms of that commitment. It is a matter of unusual precedent that a Bill based on a report which was first published in July last year should already be more than half way through its passage towards receiving Royal Assent. For that the Government can claim some proper credit. It is also a matter for congratulation to the Law Commission because, to a large extent, the Bill is based on its draft Bill, which was annexed to the report. That has made the task of preparing legislation much easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that the Bill has already completed its passage through another House. They may have noted that during that passage the Government suffered one major defeat when their lordships took exception to the use of the phrase " a titled spouse". They considered that a titled spouse could be only a spouse with a title and that outside another place it was difficult to believe that that was a relevant description. I do not wish to comment at this stage on the merits of that view, but we are now considering whether the phraseology is the most appropriate. Clearly, it is a matter which will be dealt with in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
I turn now to the clauses and shall specify the significance of each. Clause 1 is fundamental to the Bill since it confers the basic right of occupancy in the matrimonial home on a spouse who is neither the owner nor the tenant. It provides, however, that these rights may be renounced in relation to a specific property on condition that the renunciation is sworn before a notary public or justice of the peace as being made freely and without coercion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 makes the occupancy right effective and meaningful by providing for the non-titled spouse to make any necessary payments and carry out repairs to the matrimonial home so that the occupancy may be enjoyed to the full. It also empowers the court to apportion certain household expenditure between the spouses, for example, to prevent a husband who is the sole breadwinner from refusing to pay the household costs of the home for his wife and any children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 gives the court powers to enforce or regulate the occupancy rights of either spouse and to safeguard their use of the furniture and plenishings in the matrimonial home. Where there is a loss or impairment of occupancy rights, the court may order compensation to be paid by the titled spouse. It also sets out the main considerations to which the court shall have regard in regulating the occupancy rights. These are the conduct of the respective spouses, their needs and financial resources, the needs of any children and the extent to which the matrimonial homes have a business use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 provides the court with an entirely new power to enforce the occupancy right. It can make an exclusion order to suspend the occupancy rights of either spouse where this is thought necessary for the protection of the other spouse or any children from conduct injurious to their physical or mental health. Provision is made for certain interdicts to be attached to the exclusion order. For example, the court is required to attach an interdict prohibiting the offending spouse from entering the matrimonial home. It may also grant other interdicts requested by the applicant spouse, including one prohibiting the other spouse from entering or remaining in a specified area in the vicinity of the matrimonial home. That will prevent an excluded husband from loitering menacingly at the corner of the street in which the matrimonial home is situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 empowers the court to vary or recall any order relating to occupancy rights, including exclusion orders. It also sets out the circumstances in which such orders will cease to have effect, including the termination of the marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 6 to 8 are of a more technical nature. Clause 6 provides that the occupancy rights of a non-titled spouse, usually the wife, may not be prejudiced by any dealings of the other spouse except in certain circumstances. That is to prevent a husband from selling the matrimonial home to defeat his wife's occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will normally be necessary in relation to future house purchases in Scotland for a wife's consent to be obtained before the matrimonial home is sold. In order to simplify conveyancing practice on that
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
point, the consent must be in a form to be prescribed by the Secretary of State. For the purposes of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979, the occupancy right shall be regarded as an over-riding interest which is not registrable, just like a short lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Building societies have made representations expresing concern at the implications on a transaction where the titled spouse, who would normally be the husband, may fraudulently have concealed the fact that he was married and therefore the wife's consent was neither sought nor obtained. They have been concerned both at the position of the building society and of any bona fide third party who may have purchased the house in ignorance of the existing of a spouse whose occupancy rights^ may be continuing without his knowledge. We are looking into this matter urgently and it may be debated at greater length. However, I wished to make the position clear now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 sets out the circumstances in which the court may dispense with the wife's consent. These are where it is unreasonably withheld, where it cannot be given by reason of physical or mental disability, where the wife cannot be traced or where she is aged under 18. It also prevents a wife who is the owner of the matrimonial home from taking advantage of the Married Women's Property (Scotland) Act 1881 to apply to the court for an order dispensing with her husband's consent to a dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 extends certain provisions of the Bill, suitably modified, to the increasingly common circumstances where the spouses are co-proprietors of a matrimonial home. It is likely that a growing proportion of young couples buying their first home will be joint owners, but for a significant proportion of elder people, the matrimonial home will be in the husband's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 to 11 are further technical provisions to safeguard the non-titled spouse—usually the wife—against contrived bankruptcies and other contrived debts intended to defeat their occupancy rights. Although the Bill is silent on the point, the existing law will apply where a titled spouse unfortuately gets into debt. The existence of the other spouse's occupancy rights cannot prevent a trustee in bankruptcy from ingathering the bankrupt estate for the benefit of the creditors, even if that requires the sale of the matrimonial home. This is consistent with the Scottish Law Commission's general principle that the occupancy right should not confer greater benefits on the non-titled spouse than those otherwise available to the titled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 empowers the Court of Session to recall the sequestration or to make other orders where it is satisfied that a sequestration has been contrived to defeat occupancy rights. It also imposes a duty on a trustee of a bankrupt estate to notify the sequestration to the bankrupt's spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 empowers the court to set aside a poinding of furniture and plenishings, or otherwise to protect a spouse's right to their use, where the diligence has been contrived to defeat the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Clause 11 empowers the Court of Session to reduce a decree of adjudication of the matrimonial home or to make other orders, where the diligence has similarly been contrived to defeat the occupancy rights of the non-titled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 is concerned with rented accommodation only and introduces certain important new provisions which will protect a spouse in the situation that I have described. It will have an important effect upon the many couples living in local authority housing in Scotland. It gives the court a power to transfer the tenancy from one spouse to another and, where appropriate, for payment of compensation to be paid by the spouse to whom the tenancy is transferred. It also allows the power to be exercised by the Court of Session on granting a decree of divorce. This will avoid a spouse having to raise two separate actions—one for the transfer of tenancy and the other for decree of divorce. The clause sets out the factors which the court should have regard to in considering whether to grant the transfer or not, and makes provision for the landlord to be given an opportunity of being heard by the court as well as being informed of any application for a transfer of tenancy and of its granting, if that is the court's decision. It repeals the interim provision in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 which enabled the housing authority to seek a possession order in the interests of a wife, where the marriage has broken down, and enables such a wife to raise an action for a transfer of tenancy herself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 13 to 15 make detailed provision as to court orders regulating occupancy rights or providing protection against domestic violence, so that they may bite in an effective manner. Clause 13 sets the scene by defining a matrimonial interdict as one which restrains or prohibits any conduct by one spouse towards the other or a child of the family, or which excludes a spouse from the matrimonial home or from a specified area in the vicinity of that home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 provides that where a power of arrest is sought in an application for a matrimonial interdict ancillary to an exclusion order, the court is required to grant it without exception. Where any other matrimonial interdict is involved, not arising from an exclusion order, the court is obliged to grant the power of arrest unless it is persuaded by the spouse against whom the interdict is sought that a power of arrest is unnecessary in the particular circumstances of the case. It also provides that a power of arrest shall be exercisable without warrant by a police constable where he suspects that there has been a breach of the interdict. The power of arrest will remain as long as the interdict is valid. The clause provides for the appropriate chief constable to be informed of any power of arrest attached to an interdict and of any variation or recall. I recognise that these represent stiff measures in the context of the civil rather than the criminal law. Nevertheless, I believe that they are necessary if the aims of the Bill are to be effectively secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 15 is complicated. Nevertheless, it is of particular importance if these rights are to be effect-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
tively enforced. It sets out a procedure to be followed after arrest for breach of interdict in what is a grey area between the civil and criminal law. Where the breach of interdict also involves a criminal offence and the procurator fiscal decides that criminal proceedings should be taken, the normal criminal procedure will apply rather than the provisions of clause 15. However, there may be circumstances where a breach of interdict has taken place which, in the event, was not sufficiently grave to justify criminal prosecution, possibly because the presence of the police forestalled more serious conduct. The clause therefore provides that the police may release the arrested spouse if they are satisfied that there is no likelihood of further violence. They will report the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest to the procurator fiscal, who, if he decides that criminal proceedings are not to be taken, will advise the applicant spouse and her solicitor that they may, if they wish, take the necessary steps to raise an action for breach of interdict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where, however, the police are not convinced that there is no risk of violence, they may detain the arrested spouse, even though no criminal proceedings are to be taken against him. The clause goes on to provide that the arrested spouse should be brought before the sheriff on the first lawful day after his arrest. Before his appearance in court, the procurator fiscal is required to take all reasonable steps to alert the wife and her solicitor to the situation and to establish whether or not they wish to raise an action for breach of interdict. When the court appearance does take place, the sheriff will hear from the procurator fiscal the circumstances of the case and whether the wife wishes to raise an action for breach of interdict. If he considers that a substantial risk of violence by the arrested spouse would arise from his or her release, the sheriff may order the further detention of the husband for up to two days. This will enable the wife to raise her action for breach of interdict, secure in the knowledge that the husband will not be released in the interim to molest her or to coerce her into withdrawing her action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described these provisions at some length, because I recognise that they involve a degree of infringement of individual liberty. The Scottish Law Commission's draft Bill did not cover these vital procedural points, and the Government have therefore been at some pains to establish a procedure which will be both workable and fair. It is, moreover, necessary to reconcile providing a reasonable protection to a wife who has taken the significant step of legal action against her husband and yet remains aprehensive for her safety and, on the other hand, the risk that her husband, who may only be technically in breach of an interdict and whose motives may be far from vicious, being treated too harshly. I believe that the clause represents about as good a balance as is possible in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other significant clause is clause 16, which covers couples who are cohabiting but are not married to each other. It accepts that limited accupancy rights should be provided to such couples, but provides that these shall be limited initially to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
three months and thereafter may be subject to further extensions of not more than six months at a time at the discretion of the court. Thus, the clause follows the thinking of the Scottish Law Commission in not seeking to provide the same rights for cohabiting couples as are conferred on spouses, but takes a rather more liberal line on the duration of occupancy rights for cohabiting couples. The Scottish Law Commission proposes an absolute maximum of six months. The Bill, however, enables the court to extend that period at its discretion. The main factor that we wish to take into account in allowing this discretion is, of course, the position of any children of the association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining clauses are of a narrow and technical nature, but I emphasise that the principles underlying the Bill are relatively straightforward and have been widely welcomed. Clearly, there are a number of important principles which the Committee that considers the Bill will have to consider at some length. In particular, the possibility of a husband being in prison for any time before a final question of interdict is determined is a matter of significant importance, as is the position in clauses 6 to 8 of third parties who have acted bona fide in purchasing a house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has described a system whereby the spouse—a husband in most cases, presumably—can be imprisoned for lengthy periods. What provision is the State making for the maintenance of any children of that association if the spouse is liable to keep them in the interim period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no provision in the Bill enabling a spouse to be imprisoned for a long time. If a spouse is suspected of having broken the terms of an interdict, including an exclusion order, in certain circumstances he may be arrested. He will be kept in custody only if the procurator fiscal has decided to bring charges, whereupon the case would proceed as a normal criminal case with the question of bail to be considered. If the procurator fiscal does not decide that criminal charges are appropriate, that person will have to be brought to court at the first opportunity and he will be released, unless the court is satisfied that the other spouse intends to bring an action for interdict. In that case, a maximum of only two days would be permitted for the further detention of the offending spouse. That would be in circumstances only where the court was satisfied that there was a risk to the physical or mental health of the other spouse or the children of the marriage. Only in those circumstances would the detention be justified. I hope that answers the specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will make an important contribution towards creating genuine protection for spouses in Scotland—in particular, those that have been subjected to real or threatened physical or mental injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the Bill will receive the support of both sides of the Committee. In that spirit, I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce Millan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Craigton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with the Bill, Mr. Henderson, I should like to add the congratulations of the Opposition to you upon your appointment to the Chairman's Panel, and particularly on your chairmanship of the Scottish Grand Committee. I am not sure whether it is possible for anybody to enjoy a meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee but, if it is, I hope that you will enjoy your chairmanship of this Committee. We all warmly congratulate you on your appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Bill will be welcomed. I very much welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Government for introducing it so quickly after the Law Commission report. Although the Bill is expressed in mutual terms, as the Minister said, it is also true that, in the majority of cases, the additional rights which will be granted under the provisions of the Bill will be of benefit to wives rather than to husbands. That is absolutely right because the present law of Scotland in respect of rights to the matrimonial home is completely unsatisfactory, out of date, illiberal and offensive in that it does not give the wife of the husband who is the owner or tenant of the matrimonial home any rights at all. That is unacceptable, and it is necessary that we put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position has led to considerable injustice to wives. Wives who have been subjected to violence by husbands often have had no effective remedy because of their fear of eviction. In some circumstances—such as pending divorce actions— the lack of right to stay in the matrimonial home has enabled husbands—or sometimes wives—to exert pressure and blackmail on a spouse who may be reluctant to agree to divorce proceedings. Therefore, I welcome the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I say straight away that it would be foolish to believe that, having enacted the Bill, we would effectively deal with all the problems with which it is intended to deal. I do not believe that any law, however carefully drafted and implemented, can deal with all the circumstances that may arise in the breakdown of a marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law provides a certain framework within which certain rights can be exercised, but it does not provide anything like a complete solution. In that respect I must say that, when one is dealing particularly with the question of battered wives, although the Bill is a tremendous step forward, I think we would be fooling ourselves if we believed that it provided an effective solution. Even when the Bill is on the statute book, there will still be many cases of wives who have to leave the matrimonial home, or feel that they have to leave it, in distressing circumstances. The resources of the social work department or of voluntary organisations such as Scottish Women's Aid will still be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the present provision of refuges for battered wives in Scotland is wholly unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Not nearly enough facilities or places are available. The financing of the refuges is also wholly unsatisfactory. I hope that when the Solicitor-General for Scotland replies we shall hear something about the Government's attitude towards, for example, the recent COSLA report on the provision and financing of refuges. Such matters will still be very important even if we pass the Bill. There will still be a great deal to be done by way of social work, by both statutory and voluntary services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has said, the Law Commission produced a draft Bill. Anyone who has read the Law Commission's report will recognise that although the matters we are dealing with may seem at first sight to be relatively simple, they are, in practical terms, very complicated indeed. The area of law concerned is complicated, and so is the Bill. It will repay a good deal of attention in Committee, and I hope that the Government will adopt a flexible attitude; what the Minister has said this morning suggests that they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the efforts of the Law Commission and of the House of Lords, which—I pay tribute to it— looked at the Bill very fairly, a number of points in the Bill remain unsatisfactory and I hope that they will be amended in Committee or on Report. But I do not want discuss all those matters in detail this morning or to deal with simple Committee points; I intend to confine myself to a number of points on which important issues of principle arise. The more one studies the Bill, the more one sees in it, and it would be possible to make a long speech about it while dealing only with important points of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For convenience, Mr. Henderson, I shall go through some clauses of the Bill and make comments as I do so. Clause 1, which lays down the basic right of occupancy, is basically acceptable. It is essential to the whole working of the Bill. I am still not happy however, about subsection (6), which deals with renunciation of rights. It is not normal for me to argue in favour of the involvement of lawyers unless I believe that that is absolutely necessary. Here, however, there is to be a renunciation of a basic right. I believe that the only protection for the person making the renunciation is independent legal advice, which is not provided under the Bill. We all know from our constituency and other experience that many people give up basic legal rights without understanding what they have done and without taking advice. Although subsection (6) was amended and improved in another place, it still requires a certain amount of additional amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is also basically acceptable. There is no point in giving a basic right or occupancy to a spouse or wife—I shall use the term " wife " for convenience unless she is able effectively to exercise that right. Clause 2 makes the right effective, and that is welcome, although some of the drafting is somewhat obscure and I am not entirely clear as to what circumstances subsection (4) is directed. If it is intended to apply to joint owners or joint tenants of a house where both already have occupancy rights,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I am not sure why it has been included in clause 2. I would have thought that it should appear as a separate provision in some other part of the Bill. That is a point that can be dealt with in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With clauses 3 and 4 we come to the heart of the Bill. Clause 3 gives power, by application to the court, to have the rights of occupancy determined, enforced or adjusted between one party and the other. I shall make two points on clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(3) directs the court as to the circumstances to which it must have regard in making decisions under the clause. Clause 3(3) covers a mixture of circumstances which will, in many cases, conflict with one another. It appears that one factor may work to the benefit of the wife and another to the benefit of the husband. There does not seem to be a satisfactory way of amending the factors laid down in clause 3(3) and at the end of the day I think we must have regard to the decisions and discretions of the court on these matters. When there are children in the family I would attach over-riding importance to the needs of the child or children. That is covered by subsection (3)	<i>(c)</i>. I hope that the courts will interpret the clause in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is more difficult, because as I understand it—and the Solicitor-General for Scotland will no doubt correct me if I am wrong— clause 3 is not intended to provide an exclusion, either legally or de facto, from the matrimonial home. It is intended to deal with circumstances in which there is difficulty between husband and wife, but the assumption is that both will remain living in the matrimonial home, or if one has left or been forced out, he or she will return and both will five there. If there is difficulty between them the court is allowed to assert that both have a right to stay there and can adjust the rights of occupancy between one and the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is important but we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that in a large number of cases the clause, by itself, as drafted, would be effective. It is all right if one is talking about a very large house, where it is possible and practicable—although it may not be agreeable—for a husband and wife who are in serious disagreement to live separate lives on the premises because they can to a large extent avoid one another and adjust their living arrangements in a practicable manner. But in a three-apartment council house it is unrealistic to believe that, under clause 3, with the best will in the world there can be an arrangement which will adjust the respective occupancy rights of the husband and wife and allow them to live close together, sharing a bathroom and kitchen, in reasonable amity. I do not believe that that is possible. I cannot imagine how such a result can be achieved, even with the best will in the world, the best drafting and the most sensitive handling by the court. I believe that there are practical difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbaim)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it might be helpful to the Committee if I replied now to the point that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
right hon. Member is making under clause 3(1)	<i>(c)</i>, which deals with the courts' power
	<br><blockquote><p>"restricting the occupancy rights of the non-applicant spouse"</p></blockquote>
and clause 3(1)(	<i>d</i>)
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulating the exercise by either spouse of his or her occupancy rights".</p></blockquote>
That does not imply that this is a situation in which it can be said "You can use the bathroom between 5 and 6, and you can use it between 6 and 7". The court can exclude by the exercise of an occupancy right under clause 3(1)	<i>(c)</i>.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understood that explanation. Is the Solicitor-General saying, in effect, that clause 3 can be used to obtain what is de facto an exclusion order? That is not how I have read clause 3, and if that is the situation it makes clause 4 very odd. This is at the heart of the Bill. I want to come on to clause 4. It is important, when we are dealing with the rights of husband and wife that we should get it right. If we do not, some of the Bill's results may actually be perverse. I shall argue that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what the Solicitor-General said—although I stand open to correction—whatever clause 3 does in the way of restricting rights of occupancy and so on, adjusting or limiting them, I understand that the provision does not allow the court legally to exclude one of the spouses from the matrimonial home. If I am wrong about that, we shall have to study clauses 3 and 4 again. However, I suggest that in many circumstances it will be impossible, for practical reasons, for the spouses to continue to live together. They may be living in a small house with a family, where there is no way in which they can live separate existences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and I believe that that would be the practical effect of the clause—I do not object to the clause as I think it necessary—I want to find out how it will work in the sort of circumstances in which hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland live. I do not mean only people who live in large houses, where the provision may actually work in a way. I am talking about the practical realities of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either clause 3 becomes a defective exclusion order because one of the parties says that it is intolerable to live there and therefore he or she had better leave, and it becomes a de facto but not a legal exclusion order, or one has to rely on clause 4, which provides explicity for an exclusion order. It may be argued that if my criticism of clause 3 is correct, there is a remedy because an actual exclusion order may be found in clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome clause 4 and the concept of exclusion orders. I believe it to be absolutely necessary that we have the sanction of an exclusion order. But it is an important sanction. It means, for example, that an owner as well as a tenant may be excluded from his own home, as it were. We must therefore be careful about the circumstances in which we operate the provision. Whatever else we do with this legislation, we should try to provide an Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
which will have the effect and practice of what we mean when we are actually passing the Bill. I am not sure that the Bill will have that effect. We must be clear about what we are actually doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 (2) deals first with the violent husband and says that he can be excluded. That is a clear-cut case. I need not argue that—I am sure that no Committee member would argue against such provision. The provision is indispensable. But the matter goes beyond that. It does not just say that someone may be excluded for violence. A husband may be excluded because his conduct, taken as a whole, even if it is not violent, is injurious either to the wife or to the children. We have therefore gone beyond the simple concept of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that, we have not dealt with case in which, in practical terms, it is intolerable for people to live together, not because one of the spouses is indulging in a course of conduct which is injurious to the other —they may be reasonable people who are living together, both having rights of occupancy—but where the practical circumstances are intolerable. The husband may not be battering the wife or behaving badly towards her, nor may the wife be behaving badly towards the husband. It may be that for practical purposes it is intolerable for them to live together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, there is a gap because, as I said, clause 3 does not cover the situation, while clause 4 (2) as drafted does not go back to clause 3 (3) as I thought it might do. Clause 4 (2) does not go back to the balance of the needs of the family, and so on. It is taken by itself, specifying violence or a particular course of conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is either a gap in the position, and the Bill does not deal with the type of case I have described, or what will happen in practice is that the courts will so widely interpret clause 4 (2) that they will exclude many husbands who should not be excluded because, in the normal sense, they are not guilty parties. They have not been violent towards their wives or they have not been engaged in any deleterious conduct; they are just caught up in a situation where the husband and wife are living together in a small house and it is intolerable that they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unsatisfactory because, if it happens, clause 4 will attract, not normal cases as I understand it, but all the powers of arrest, and so on. It will also attract for the unfortunate husband who is excluded under clause 4 the implication that he is really being violent in a disagreeable way towards his wife. It would be unfortunate if clause 4 (2) were widened by the courts in a way that excluded husbands under false premises. I think that we have to face that dangerous reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a gap, we should try to fill it. We must introduce the concept of it being unreasonable or intolerable for the husband and wife to live together having regard to the factors laid out in clause 3(3) and also to the physical circumstances of the house. It would be possible, in effect, to get an exclusion order explicitly because it was intolerable for the husband and wife to live together even in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
circumstances where he had not been violent and he had not engaged in disagreeable conduct. I think that it should be done explicitly rather than done by court decisions which continually stretch clause 4(2). I understand that something like that has already happened in English courts. I hope that the Government will consider this matter in Committee. While I think that a tremendous amount of care has gone into the drafting of the Bill, I am not sure that we have it right yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 is absolutely necessary to prevent a husband frustrating his wife's rights by selling the house of which he is the sole owner. But there are two points that I should like to make. First, the right of purchase must be taken care of. I was glad to hear what the Minister said because I am not sure that a perfectly innocent purchaser might not find himself, perhaps in later years, subject to some inhibitions about occupying his own home because an occupancy right, which was not disclosed, could be asserted against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, renunciation should not be done without legal advice, because it is not sensible to allow a husband or wife to renounce rights unless he or she is absolutely sure of what he or she is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 refers to the transfer of tenancy. I do not understand why there should be any question of compensation under clause 1 because, when the Bill is passed, a transfer of tenancy will not have the same effect as a transfer of tenancy under the existing law. A transfer of tenancy from one spouse to the other does not defeat the occupancy rights of the spouse from whom the tenancy has been taken. That is one reason why a wife could be in a rather worse position under this Bill than hitherto. Under existing law, a wife who gets a transfer of tenancy specifically from a local authority will automatically in effect get an exclusion order against her husband. Once the tenancy has been transferred to the wife, the husband loses all rights in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I pointed out that under clauses 3 and 4 the wife may assert her occupancy rights but without having a legal right to get her husband out of the house, she would be better off under the existing law, if her husband was a tenant, by getting a transfer of tenancy. Unless we get clauses 3 and 4 right, we shall get a perverse situation where a wife is disadvantaged under the Bill compared with present law. That is why I am so anxious to get clauses 3 and 4 right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the right hon. Gentleman's argument, although I want to. I do not understand how a spouse might be worse off than under the existing law. A wife will lose no existing rights. We are providing here an additional means whereby a tenancy can be transferred in either the public or the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not made myself clear. Under the existing law, the tenant has all the rights and the spouse has none, but that means that if the wife manages to get a transfer of tenancy from the husband to herself, as happens in local authority cases at present, she inherits, as it were, all the rights, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the husband has absolutely none at all. In effect, the husband can be excluded at present by the simple process of a transfer of tenancy, but I am saying that under the Bill the wife can still get the transfer of tenancy under clause 12 but she does not actually defeat the husband's occupancy right. That is a separate issue. She still has to go through clauses 3 and 4, and if we have not got them right from the point of view of exclusion, she could be worse off under this measure than under the existing law, if she can get a transfer of tenancy. That is why I am so anxious to get this right. We could find cases where the wife is actually disadvantaged by the Bill and, obviously, none of us wants that to happen. That is the first point concerning clause 12. These are important points of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point, which is connected with the last, is why should compensation be payable to the excluded tenant? The tenant still has the right to occupancy, so how has he suffered? If a tenant had a transfer of tenancy granted against his will, the only instance where he would suffer financial penalty would be under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act—against our will, too, may I say?—when he was about to buy his council house. If he was going to buy a council house worth about £20,000 for £10,000 and, before he could do so, his wife obtained a transfer of tenancy, he would immediately lose £10,000, in effect. The £10,000 advantage goes, of course to the wife who has the new tenancy. But, if the husband then claimed £10,000 compensation from his wife under clause 12(1) and it was granted, I do not think that the wife would be in a happy position with a transfer of tenancy. She would be worse off than by staying where she was, as she has no means of paying £10,000. I honestly do not see any justification for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he will deal with it. I do not wish to be discourteous by not giving way but perhaps the Solicitor-General for Scotland will deal with it in reply. I simply make the point now that I am against compensation payments under clause 12(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also against subsection (11), which takes away existing rights under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act. I see absolutely no reason—this was argued in the other place—why the existing rights under that Act, which allow a transfer of tenancy at the initiative of the local authority, should not continue alongside the new rights in clause 12. I do not see why they should not be concurrent rights. Incidentally, the rights under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act do not involve any payment of compensation to the husband. That is another important reason why we should continue the rights so recently granted under that Act. I see no convincing reason for not doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a rather peculiar mixture of criminal and civil proceedings in clauses 14 and 15, which I think raises difficulties. I appreciate what the Government are trying to do, and the Minister's explanation was valuable. I think that we shall want to study what he said because it concerns a part of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the Bill that was changed in the other place. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is rather peculiar that a husband can be sent to prison even if he has not evinced any violence towards his wife or is unlikely to do so. Perhaps that should be so in particular cases, but it is a matter which has to be looked at carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that clause 16 is much improved as compared with the original drafting before it went to the other place and was there amended. As I understand it, it now gives the court maximum discretion to take account of all the circumstances of a case. There is a tremendous difference between, on the one hand, a cohabiting couple with no family or other responsibilities who may have been living together for three months, and, on the other hand, a man and woman who may have been living together for 10 years and have two or three children. It is difficult to write the law to give the same rights to the applicant spouse in both cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have got the Bill as it now stands basically right. Therefore, discussions in the other place were most valuable. The Bill directs the court to look at the length of time for which the couple have lived together, and whether there are any children from the relationship, and it gives virtually an unfettered right for the court, in its discretion, to keep extending the protection of the Bill indefinitely, although for periods of six months at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken for longer than I intended. I welcome the Bill but we must make absolutely sure that we get it right. We must get it right in fairness to some husbands who should not be pilloried, for example, or treated as if they were violent when they are not. We must also get it right particularly in fairness to wives who, under the present law, suffer disadvantages and injustices which are completely intolerable. Those injustices sometimes reach the level of physical violence, which is now a blot upon society in Scotland. If the Bill removes some of the worst excesses of wife battering in Scotland it will be very warmly received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In another place, Lord Ross of Marnock welcomed the Bill but complained that there had not been a debate on the Law Commission's report. That would have been redundant on this occasion, when the Government are proceeding so rapidly, because there was a draft Bill in the report. Therefore, we are effectively debating the Law Commission's report when we debate the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Divorce statistics do not necessarily reflect, in the way in which they have recently risen, that marriage as an institution is suddenly breaking down. Rather, those statistics reflect a more open approach to the reality that many marriages have in the past broken down but that their breakdown has been concealed. So, too, recognition of the increasing
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
problem of violence in the home is not so much recognition of a new phenomenon but of one which has gone on for many years, indeed for centuries, and of which there is now a more open appraisal, with statistics perhaps more readily available. We are right to act now and would be negligent in not acting since the facts are now better known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked the Minister to have made reference in passing to the experience in England, where I understand a similar law was enacted four or five years ago. It would be interesting to hear what effect that law has had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made reference to the terms " non-titled spouses" and " applicants". This clatter of nomenclature is not a frivolous point, but of some importance. It is most important that those involved in the provisions of the Bill when it becomes law should know precisely what their rights are, especially when we consider that the intellect of those who might be involved is more likely to be of a lower than a higher level. I find some difficulty in distinguishing between a " non-titled spouse ", an " entitled applicant" an " unentitled, non-entitled applicant" and so on. That aspect ought to be considered further in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important, not just in respect of the social problem of violence in the home. It also seems to me—I am not a lawyer—to have a major effect on the whole basis of conveyancing and property rights in Scotland. It also raises questions concerning the recognition, in legal terms, of cohabitation. Clearly, if the purpose of the Bill was to treat the dignified status of common law husband or wife in parity with that of a married man and woman, one would have no qualms. But this is a matter which one should perhaps approach with some care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend Lord Mansfield, in another place, winding-up on Second Reading and being questioned about clause 16, pointed out that the clause began with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a man and a woman are living with each other as if they were man and wife".</p></blockquote>
He said they may be committing fornication or be in some kind of adulterous relationship. He also pointed out that not so long ago, in such circumstances, the injured spouse could bring an action alleging what in Scotland was called criminal conversation. That concept raises all sorts of fascinating possibilities. I suppose that the more up-to-date equivalent would be discussing Ugandan affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend pointed out that that had now been swept away and, under clause 16, the law is not concerned to delve into the marital status, or lack of it, of either party. It is simply interested in whether they are living together as man and wife. These are murky waters, and it matters not whether they are living in a caravan or on a houseboat, both of which are referred to in the Bill. The Bill is helpful in defining a caravan. It states that " caravan "
	<br><blockquote><p>"means a caravan which is mobile or affixed to the land".</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, it does not tackle the definition of a houseboat. I suggest that a houseboat is a house
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
on a boat, which is mobile or immobile, and is afloat and affixed to the land or aground and affixed to the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The murky waters to which I refer relate not to those in which a houseboat may come to rest, but to the relationship of unmarried people. As I said, one would not wish to harm the rights of common law husband and wife who may have lived together for 20 years and raised a family; but casual relation-chips between men and women are in a different category when the power of the law is brought to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The murkiness of these waters becomes even more confused if we follow the American trend through alimony to calumny—and I believe the latest is galumny suites. I am not a palaeontologist, 	<i>so</i> I venture no further. However, I ask that the clause be considered with great care, because it raises a range of issues on which more thought would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been made that the law will not solve the problem of violence in the home, but will help to do so. It will improve the position. It should be taken in partnership with the criminal law. It is right that it should seek to strengthen the rights of women. However, I add the caution that the rights of husbands should also be borne in mind, particularly when, as in the case of violence in the home, proof is often difficult to come by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the noble Lord Mackie of Benshie overstated the position when he quoted the lawyer who had written to him saying that any woman who inveigles a man into marrying her can torment him until he raises his hand to her, and then she can have him put out of his house and live in it rent-free for the rest of her natural life. I dare say that he would concede that he was overstating the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I urge my hon. Friend to bear in mind the rights of the husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any action in favour of the wife should take account of the reaction it will have on the rights of her male partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those comments, I warmly welcome the Bill and wish it all speed to the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. It has been long awaited. Although the Government are to be congratulated on having acted so quickly on the Law Commission's report, it is still true that the provisions which the Bill would introduce into the law of Scotland have already been made available in many other European countries. The principle of taking care of wives who may be facing the threat of violence has been accepted in many other lands. Scotland has a bad reputation for battered wives
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
and for the alcohol abuse that initiates some of the attacks. It is therefore particularly scandalous that Scotland should have had to wait so long for such a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that in the 1960s—well before I arrived at the House—there was a Select Committee on the abuse of women. My former colleague, Mrs Winifred Ewing, served as a member of that Select Committee and produced a minority report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the territory we are entering is very complicated. In comparison with the Minister's gallop through the Bill, I commend the speech by the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craighton (Mr. Millan). He gave a penetrating analysis of some of the complications of this measure. Having abandoned sexiest terminology, the Government could not have called the Bill a wives' charter, but they might have wished to call it a spouses' charter. Undoubtedly, however, it will be a lawyers' charter. The spouses concerned will have to consult solicitors at every stage, because there will be applications to the court. The fading fortunes of the Faculty of Advocates could be revived by this provision. [An HON. MEMBER: " And the solicitors."] I doubt very much whether the fortunes of solicitors are fading, but the Faculty has been worried lest it should lose most of its divorce trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was desirable that certain of the propositions in the Bill should be critically considered, as they were, by the right hon. Member for Craighton. I should like, to make some of the points that have occurred to me. I shall try not to traverse the territory crossed by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2—" Subsidiary and consequential rights"—although there is provision for certain benefits to be given in relation to occupancy rights and, indeed, a special provision in relation to the acquisition or use of furniture being acquired under hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, there seems to be no provision about household furniture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been my experience in my constituency and, before I became a Member for Parliament, as a solicitor, that where there is a dispute between husband and wife, the spouse who is in control of the house and who faces the prospect of leaving it, or who has been deserted, sometimes disposes completely and at nominal value of the household furniture. Unless we try to take care of that possibility, the spouse to whom the right of occupancy is given may inherit a house without furniture and may not be able to refurnish it. That is a point that the Government will have to consider, particularly as it would appear from subsection (5), where there is specific reference to hire purchase, that the question of furniture has been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a possibility in relation to clause 3, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, that, in connection with the conduct of spouses, some difficulties could arise over the question of proof. The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) also mentioned this problem. No doubt the Solicitor-General for Scotland will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that the question of corroboration is mentioned anywhere in the Bill. It is extremely difficult at times to establish the conduct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
of spouses, and perjury or misrepresentation of a situation is not unknown. Husbands, in particular, may have a special worry about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Craigton said that the words in clause 3(3)	<i>(a)</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the spouses in relation to each other and otherwise"</p></blockquote>
—which is a splendid phrase—could relate to where the spouses were equally reasonable. But the court may face a situation where the spouses' conduct may be equally unreasonable. Therefore, it may be difficult for the court to decide who shall have occupancy in a given situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as the right hon. Member for Craigton said, that the needs of the children of the family should have priority and precedence. It is possible that, as a matter of practicality, those who have custody or possession of the children will automatically have a right to the matrimonial home. If the courts follow their usual judgments in these matters, it is more likely to mean that the mother, who normally has possession or custody of the children, will succeed to the use of the matrimonial home. This matter raises many interesting questions about custody actions which may follow resulting in a considerable amount of litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to clause 6. The Minister was fair in admitting the Government's quandary in relation to the problems posed by the building societies. I am not knowledgeable about experience in England in relation to these matters, but I understand that building societies or lenders of real estate or heritable property in England insist that the wife should be the joint proprietor of a property and that there should be a joint obligation in relation to the property. So, for the protection of the lender, I suspect that joint titles will be taken more widely in Scotland in future. Indeed, there has been a trend in that direction over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remains a problem in relation to properties that have already been taken in the name of the husband, or where one spouse is providing all the money and wishes to take the title direct, as to how the rights of third parties may be safeguarded. My first inclination was that it might be possible to record some kind of order in the register of inhibitions and adjudications to make a prospective purchaser wary of buying. What that notice would be is a matter of judgment. It might be a notice of a decree giving the right of occupation or it might be a notice of a matrimonial interest—the very fact of marriage—which would put any prospective purchaser on his guard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the practical point of view, practising solicitors will have a great deal of worry, particularly at the stage of formulation of missives. I have looked again at the recommendations of the Law Society of Scotland. It appears to take the view that the register of inhibitions and adjudications would not necessarily be the best way in which these matters should be recorded. It felt that it would be better if both the matrimonial interest and any renunciation of that matrimonial interest could be
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
recorded in the property register—the Register of Sasines. It felt that that would be the best way to safeguard the interests of a spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that this legislation will cause a considerable amount of difficulty to solicitors and therefore to the sellers of property. Any degree of uncertainty how the rights of third parties may be affected could have reverberations down the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 is the one that we should look at closely. I am glad that the Minister said that he was having urgent discussions. If the Government can come up with a suitable solution, it will save much heart-searching and consultation on the part of other Members of Parliament who may be involved in the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of clause 12, will the rights of tenants of tied houses be taken into account? Has there been any specific consideration of a tied house, which is normally restricted for the purposes of the job to a particular person? Does it mean that the spouse of that person would not be able to exercise the right of occupation? Does the Solicitor-General consider that to be a satisfactory position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Craigton made a point in respect of joint or common tenants of a matrimonial home which is a council house, recognising the efforts made during the passage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill to have the clause put in. I reserve my position on the matter of compensation which the right hon. Gentleman rightly brought to the attention of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the complicated provisions of clauses 14, 15 and 16, civil rights questions arise as to how proper it is for someone to be kept in custody. I suggest that that matter must be looked at again. Questions also arise in respect of the quality of evidence, onus of proof and corroboration—matters which so far have been the bastions of Scots law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two interests which should be taken together are the titled spouse occupying the matrimonial home and the person who is affected by intolerable conduct on the part of that spouse and who may seek occupation of the home. When the facts are uncertain, or where there may be perjury and misrepresentation, it is not always easy to see where the rights should be allocated. I suggest that the courts may have to exercise the judgment of Solomon on many occasions in respect of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I congratulate the Government on their initiative in bringing it forward. However, I imagine that the Committee proceedings will throw up many complex issues not only of law but of the attitude of society itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we were debating in Committee the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill, the Minister made reference to the report being considered by the Law Commission. Frankly, I think that none of us anticipated that this Bill would be brought before the House of Commons so soon after the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill and so soon after the report was published by the Law Commission. For that reason
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) in commending the Government on introducing this piece of legislation so quickly after the Law Commission's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) was right to point to the fact that, although this may be a bold, imaginative and important piece of social reform in Scotland, no one should under estimate its far-reaching character and nature in respect not only of consistorial law but potentially of the law of property. Therefore the Bill will require most careful examination in Committee. For example, in a slightly flippant fashion perhaps, my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway pointed to the curious use of the descriptions " titled " and " non-titled " spouses. Apart from that inelegance, many substantial matters may require to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides further elaborations on the law. Therefore, the chances of introducing any substantial simplification into the law of conveyancing in Scotland in the near future are probably well and truly out of the window. I cannot imagine that it will mean getting missives concluded in a shorter, sharper and more simple fashion when any solicitor worth his salt will necessarily have to ensure that, if his client is married, he has at the time of missives, not just at the time of disposition, the consent of the spouse. Possibly when the client is unmarried, the Solicitor will have to check matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have got the legislation right in the sense that they are properly having regard to bona fide purchasers. It is important that the independent, innocent, third party, whatever complications are introduced into the marriage law in Scotland, should continue to enjoy his or her property rights perhaps at a remote future date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) began to get into difficulties when he dealt with clause 12 and said that in certain circumstances a wife might be in a better position without this legislation. This is where, to some extent, we are getting caught on the hook of attempting not to be sexist in our approach. Everyone knows that we are trying to deal with the wife who is violently treated by her husband in their own home, but, because we cannot say that, we are tangled up in elaborate legislation. Indeed, this goes back to my hon. Friend's point about titled and non-titled classes. We are really talking about wives. All the complications that emerge through the first four clauses and into clause 12 stem from our not facing that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other points arise. One which causes me considerable interest is that of the power to be given to the courts to attach to a matrimonial interdict a power of arrest. It will be interesting to know more about experience in England on this matter. I have doubts whether the judges or the sheriffs in Scotland will readily attach power of arrest to interdicts. It stems from the problem that all interdicts proceed on the basis that the conduct complained of is not criminal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will see from clause 14(1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall, on the application of the applicant spouse, attach a power of arrest".</p></blockquote>
It is mandatory on the courts if it is an interdict that has been granted under section 4 of the Act as it will become.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but in a sense it begs the question in terms of the granting of the interdict. I may have short-circuted it. There may be a greater chance of getting the interdict if one does not seek the power of arrest. Because it is a matter of discretion, the court has power to modify the terms of the interdict, or to indicate that it will grant an interdict only if the terms are so modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of an interdict is that the conduct complained of be not criminal. In those circumstances it seems curious to provide such a power of arrest, for what the non-applying spouse may have done may not of itself be sufficient to give rise to criminal proceedings. This is part of the Bill which we shall have to examine very carefully in relation not only to that power as such but to the procedures that follow arrest under that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that a former Labour Secretary of State for Scotland made a splendid reactionary speech in another place when he referred to the law of marriage in Scotland before that dreadful 1 July 1940 when the forms of marriage which allowed one to make promises and subsequently to copulate were done away with. It seems that the law is in a curious state at the moment. We are beginning to extent into our law a limited right to property in respect of a couple who are not married but who might have been married before 1 July 1940. We are giving them a limited right to property when that relationship is unhappy. But if that relationship were happy, in the unfortunate event of one them dying intestate and the other wishing to stay on in that property, under clause 16 that person would have no right to the property whatsoever. It seems to be a slightly quirky development in law which gives a limited right to property to a couple with an unhappy relationship, whereas, if a relationship has been totally successful for years, nothing may be conferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that I join the former Secretary of State for Scotland in believing that the founding fathers of the law of Scotland had a far greater understanding of relationships between men and women and ensured that property rights were allowed. The circle is beginning to turn again, and it seems to be turning in an odd way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not try to match the detailed arguments put forward so far. I shall deal only with the principal purpose of the Bill and the social background to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, both parties will have rights of occupancy and there will be protection to spouse and children from violence. Both parties are to be treated equally, but the principal beneficiary will be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

wife. I shall not try to avoid that aspect, not because I am being sexist but because it is easier to explain the increasing concern for battered wives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years provision has been made by local authorities within my area, which has been supported by the social work department of the Strathclyde region. We should pay tribute to the work of the social work department in what it is seeking to do. I am sure that all Committee members have listened in their surgeries to young mothers and been moved by the sadness of such families. It was helpful to know that it was possible for me to make representations to the regional authority and to get something done about it. I am sure that women are no longer prepared to put up with violence in the family. There is a growing awareness in this respect, and the fact that the Bill has been brought forward at this time is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lead has been taken in the work place. Trade unions and employers have gone some way towards helping women in such circumstances, and there has been the formation of equal opportunities committees by trade unions. Such committees help women workers to identify their rights not only in the work place but in the domestic scene. That awareness of rights outside the home environment is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, fear of exposure that causes many married women to avoid saying anything, making any reference to the law or seeing their lawyer or family doctor about violence. Within our society there is still a fear of ridicule: that in some way the woman is responsible for the violence, and that the male partner is violent towards the wife because of a failing on her part. There are strong family pressures to cover up such matters. Unfortunately, as I have said, they have the idea of ridicule, which is a village mentality, where it is not done to say that one's marriage is not a success and that it contains elements of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That idea is now disappearing, but it remains in some areas. To conform to the norm means to cover up and create a pretence of what the norm is. Those attitudes are still with us, but they are vanishing rapidly due to social and economic changes and the change in attitude between men and women at work. I am sure that it is at the work place that the change is taking place, and that a more enlightened attitude is now beginning to prevail. Yet, family violence remains a problem. Some of it stems from alcohol abuse—and I want to say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper—"Observations on the report from the Select Committee on Violence in Marriage"—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Government should now introduce a vigorous publicity campaign against the excessive use of alcohol, and should formulate a positive policy on the advertisement of alcohol."</p></blockquote>
There was some response to that in Scotland, but not enough, and public opinion is now ready to accept a more vigorous campaign against alcohol abuse. Those who suffer from alcohol abuse are often wives and children within the family unit. Again, good work has been done by at least one local authority—the Glasgow district council—
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
which has an agreement with its work people whereby those who clearly have a drink problem are able to obtain assistance without their employment being placed in jeopardy. Advice along those lines is now available from the Scottish Trade Union Congress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, Mr. Henderson.

We should support the right to occupy, where the husband has the house, and we should support the exclusion orders. I have not dealt with the clauses in detail, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) identified areas of serious worry. Opposition Members will seek to improve the Bill in those respects. I strongly support his comments. If I serve on the Committee, I shall work to that end with my right hon. and hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

First, I should like to say how much I enjoyed the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). As a layman, it reminded me of the jousting that used to take place when Willie Ross and George Willis were occupying the Front Bench, and the Back Benches too. I think that George was on the Back Benches at that time. They took the trousers off successive collections of legal Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend's speech was a startling contrast to the speech made by the Minister who churned through a brief as if he was not enjoying a single minute of it. His was a highly monotonous method of delivery. He really must educate himself into at least trying to entertain as well as to inform us. I prefer legal points to be explained by laymen such as my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Government to understand that, if they are to get through important legislation like this, they must keep their members here. The Government have co-opted English members to make up their numbers, and even then they cannot sustain a quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extremely difficult to comprehend the legal points that are being discussed. Therefore, I can speak on this matter only in general terms. I share my right hon. Friend's view—I think that it is shared by all members of the Committee—that the Bill does not and cannot provide remedies for the problems that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was the Chairman of the Select Committee on Violence in Marriage which reported in 1975. We visited refuges in Scotland, Wales and England, and the stories of violence that we heard were horrific. We were told of a dentist who put his wife into his own dental chair—God knows how! —and subjected her to professional violence. The story was so horrifying that I found it almost unbelievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain people say that wives like violence in marriage—that it is an occupational hazard that they enjoy. That view is seriously put forward by psychologists, psychiatrists and others. I do not know whether it is true. The point I want to make is that, however willing and anxious Governments are to introduce legislation on these problems, legislation can do no more than alleviate them. One cannot arrange these matters and fit them into watertight legalistic compartments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with horror the other day that some Tory lawyers had suggested the appointment of a Minister for marriage. I find it quite incomprehensible that, although the Tories talk about individual freedom, Tory lawyers want to put these problems into legal
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
straitjackets and to have a Minister in Whitehall to deal with the problems of marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that those who made the suggestion were concerned about the public expenditure aspects of marriage and divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was about to suggest. Perhaps Sir Derek Rayner is considering this problem and finding out how much divorce is costing us. He may have said that it must stop, that the Prime Minister must do something about it, and so Tory lawyers have go together and said that the Government ought to deal with these problems by appointing a Minister for marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings on the Bill in the other place. It is interesting to note that the Bill was introduced in the House of Lords by Lord Mansfield, the Minister of State at the Scottish Office, who lives in Scone Palace. No doubt he knows all about the problems that arise from inadequate accommodation in council houses and from unemployment. Today's social problems are responsible to a large degree—although not wholly— for the increasing amount of domestic violence that is occurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hon. Friends intended to enlarge on the problems of alcohol. The Committee is not concerned with the causes of matrimonial violence, but there is no doubt that that is the most important component of the problems with which we are seeking to deal by means of the Bill. Any attempt to put the problems into legalistic jargon frightens me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a class problem. As our report made plain, violence in marriage occurs in all strata of society—from the most poverty-stricken family to the wealthiest. But, generally speaking, those in the top section have additional homes to go to, or are in other ways better equipped to solve their problems than people at the lower end of the income scale. Moreover, ordinary working people are very frightened of consulting lawyers or going to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finer committee, in this context and in the context of the one-parent family, recommended the provision of family courts. It would do as much as anything to relieve the anxiety and distress caused by domestic violence if the spouse—who could be a man or a woman, but it is generally a woman- -knew that he or she had access to a family court which had a degree of informality and a lack of expense that is not normally available in the ordinary courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill, but it can have only a limited effect on matrimonial violence. The problem requires a much more fundamental approach. The committee of which I was chairman laid a great deal of stress on the ways in which matrimonial violence could be prevented, rather than dealing with it as if it were inevitable. A certain amount of such violence is inevitable and will occur whatever we do about the law. The problem should be tackled by prevention of the abuse of alcohol, family planning, full employment and education, rather than by the Bill.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
As I said, I welcome the Bill, but its great attraction to the Government lies in the final sentence of the Explanatory Memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill is not expected to have any significant public expenditure or public Service manpower implication."</p></blockquote>
That is the attraction. They are geting something for nowt. They appear to be doing something, and it will not cost anything. Most of the measures that the Select Committee recommended, and most of the Finer recommendations which attempted to get at the roots of the problem, would have cost money. Neither the Labour Government nor the Tory Government were prepared to accept those recommendations for that very reason. Unless we are prepared to use financial and other resources to tackle the root causes of these problems, such legislation will only tinker with the problem and have a marginal effect on it. It is not credible to suggest that it is a remedy or a solution to the problem. I do not think that the Government would claim that it is the last word on it. The Government and the Bill just tinkering with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Martin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take the word of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members that this is a good Bill. Not being a lawyer, I do not know whether it is good. I do not think that wives will jump for joy when they hear that the Bill is going into Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of the rights of wives concerning property and the household. Having been brought up in a community in which there was a great deal of family violence, it has been my experience that by the time the wife has reached the stage where she wants to get out and set up on her own, she has been subjected to so much abuse and violence and so much drink and gambling has been involved that often the poor girl has no property except what she stands in. Some will benefit by getting rights of tenancy or mortgages, but most such girls are looking only for a roof over their heads. They just want to get away from it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is mention in the Bill of the rights of children. I hope that when the Bill is in Committee we shall consider the problems that children experience in homes where the husband is violent and does not give enough financial support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many violent husbands are very cunning when wives take the step of calling in the police. After the police have been called in a few times, a violent husband usually turns his attention to the children, particularly teenagers. If a child is over 16 years of age and legally could be put out of the house, the husband, to get at the wife, usually picks on the teenager. That is often because the child is old enough to take sides with his mother. We should make sure that that type of husband does not direct his aggression towards the child. I am not thinking necessarily of violence. There are degrees of violence. If a threat is made that the child will be put out of the house at 11 pm, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
is violence towards the wife because she will worry about what will happen to the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), I think that there should be a place other than a court to which a family can go to discuss their difficulties. I have met girls who have had scars, black eyes and noticeable serious bruises, but they have covered up for their husbands. They do not wish to get involved with the indignity of having to attend court. If there were a place to which they could go to discuss their problems and find out their rights that would be far more attractive to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial provision should be made for looking into the causes of family violence. I hope that the police will consider these problems more seriously. All too often the police do not wish to get involved in family disputes. That would be understandable if the dispute were on a Friday night and there were many other matters to worry the police. When the police do arrive, in many cases it is an inexperienced police officer who does not know how to handle the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to consider this problem seriously, we should take steps to make sure that every social service worker is fully trained to cope with family violence. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) about social work departments. Social workers in Glasgow tell me that they are overworked and that many of these problems have to be pushed aside. If they argue that they cannot cope with such problems, there should be more pressure to make sure that they have more resources made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no doubt that a broken marriage is an unpleasant and wounding experience and, tragically, it often degenerates into a form of legal or social war—a war in which, because of the inadequacies of our present legal system, one party is at a hopeless disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill because it is an attempt to right the balance and to equip the law to deal as best it can—though it will often be an unsatisfactory best—with a difficult and intractable social problem on which it has been asked to pass judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot quantify the problem of violence in marriage, a point which has been well made. Strangely enough, there was a promise in the then Government's answer to the Select Committee, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that something would be done in the Scottish criminal statistics to try and allow us to get a picture of the number of cases brought to the notice of the police and brought to the courts. That has not, in fact, happened.

We know that in serious crimes—murder, for example—inter-family violence and tension is an important motivating cause. Research was carried out by the Doctors Dobash, and related in a book entitled " Violence against wives ", Open Books, published in 1980, making it clear that the problem is very substantial in Scotland. The Doctors Dobash looked at no fewer than 34,000 police reports in Edinburgh, and in a major police district of Glasgow, that had been passed to the procurators fiscal. They looked behind the simple charge and at the police report itself. They discovered that in 34-5 per cent, of the reports inter-family violence was the root cause. In 12 per cent, of cases it was a wife's assault upon her husband—a significant number of cases. However, a vaster number, about 25 per cent., were of husbands assaulting wives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has worked in the criminal courts, as I have, and better, perhaps, as a solicitor, than as an advocate, is aware of the endless, sad procession of breaches of the peace usually involving drink and assault upon a wife, often at weekends, which one has to deal with as a kind of normal currency of the custodies on a Friday or a Saturday. One commentator has put it that, statistically, it is safer to be on the streets after dark with a stranger than at home in the bosom of one's family, for it is there that accident, murder and violence are likely to occur. That may be slightly overstating the case, but it contains a degree of truth in that we are dealing with a big problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East, has suggested, drink is a major fact. Professor McClintock, in his essay entitled " Criminological aspects of family violence ", published in 1978, makes the point that that is a particular feature of the Scottish scene. The difficulty is that even if one could identify the cases that come to court, they are only what I might call the visible edge of a very major problem, which is deeply rooted in Scottish social attitudes. We all have to accept that no amount of change in the superficial machinery of the law will immediately eradicate these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not solely one of violence. One point I should like to make—and which was made very ably by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan)—is that we are not dealing just with violence. What we are doing here is changing the balance in a number of other ways between spouses in a marriage breakup or union breakup. There is a real ring of Victorian " penny dreadful" about the law as presently constituted. We are all aware of the saying " Do not darken my door again ", but that is the position which, even today, a spouse who has the title to a house can enforce upon the wife or upon the husband who has not. They can literally be sent to trudge round the family looking for shelter or for the somewhat doubtful help and refuge under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. It is right that we should recognise that an occupancy right is a fundamental right. After all, we talk about the matrimonial home and implicit in that is the suggestion that both of the parties in matrimony have the right to
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
that home. The wife should not be there—again, I use the term " wife " as a shorthand term—as though the home were a grace-and-favour residence in which she was allowed to " squat" as long as the husband thought she was acceptable to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe that the basis of the Bill is correct, but we must also in Committee study with great care some of the consequences. Undoubtedly, the shift which the Bill represents will be an important bargaining counter when we consider the financial consequences or other arrangements that are to fall on a separation or divorce. My right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton was absolutely right to draw attention to the difficulties that may emerge with clause 3 and the declarator of occupancy rights. I believe that he is self-evidently correct in saying that, in dealing with a normal three or four-apartment house, it will be de facto impossible to expect people to cohabit under that roof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are presupposing here a situation in which all normal communications and agreement have broken down and one spouse has actually gone to the courts to ask for a declarator or for a regulation of occupancy rights. That suggests very fractured and difficult circumstances. It is impossible to assume that the couple can continue to cohabit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What may happen in practice is. that a declarator of occupancy in favour of the wife will become in effect an exclusion order for the husband. The important point that arises—and we must look at this very carefully—is whether it will be right to say that specifically in clause 3, as it is not, in my view, said at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General—I know that he will want to expand on this in a moment—said something which surprised me. He said that if we look at clause 3 and take the right in paragraph (c) to restrict occupancy rights and in 	<i>(d)</i> to regulate the exercise of occupancy rights, the courts will be able to have a non-stigmatised exclusion—in other words, an exclusion without having to go to clause 4 and allege the equivalent of unreasonable conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is arguable that that is the right interpretation of the social intention, but I do not believe that it is clearly stated here, and if that is the Government's view of the meaning of clause 3 we shall have to look carefully at the drafting in Committee, because I believe that the Solicitor-General is expressing an intention that is not at present in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as clause 3(3) is concerned, the criteria will be dominated, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton said, by who has in fact got the children. We must face up to this. Inevitably the courts will take the view that at the end of the day the care and control of the children should go with the matrimonial home. Therefore there will be times— this has to be said—when it will be rough justice on a husband who has not been violent but has merely got into a state of total non-communication, which is no more his fault than his wife's inevitably leading to separation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members were asking about English judgments and, from experiences under the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
we find that exactly that situation has arisen. In the famous ease of Spindlow, which was reported in 1; All ER, 1979 on page 169, the parties to the action were unmarried but there was, a child of the association. There was no suggestion of violence but the wife merely said that she could no longer live under the same roof. She had' a " thing " if you like-, about the husband, and they just, could not live together. In that case, an order was made ordering the man out of the house purely and simply on the basis of the practical reality that the wife would be looking after the children and the husband would merely leave—the children had to be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that is hard, but it is almost inevitable and we must be prepared; to face up to it. I quote from Lord Justice Ormond's judgment, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" What we have to deal with is the reality of the situation, which is that the two children are in need of a home and are without one ",</p></blockquote>
so the husband went. I am prepared to defend that position, but I am prepared to do so in terms of recognising that it will occasionally lead to apparent injustices and that it is impossible to get the balance totally right, where no one. is hurt in the damaging situations which these actions inevitably recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the property side, the consequence of a wife having to give consent before a sale can be completed will obviously be an important bargaining factor,, particularly in middle-class marriages where financial considerations are paramount. It may even be a means of enforcing settlement on husbands in terms of access and so on which might not otherwise be agreed to. Again, we must recognise that there is a, great change in what one might call the power structure. Anyone engaged in law who has taken part in these bargaining sessions will know that it changes the power considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful: to the Under-Secretary for what he said about the situation in which an unmarried person is selling property, because there is a problem here. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Eraser) got this matter a little wrong, no doubt accidentally. The true problem in some ways is where the bachelor comes along and says that he. will sell his house for £30,000. The purchaser's solicitor asks how the person can give him a title which he can accept, given the fact that an undeclared wife may suddenly turn up from Australia in three years' time and enforce her occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are today making in this law occupancy rights unchallenged, irrespective of time, even against a title taken in good faith by an arm's. length third party who has purchased for a; substantial consideration. It: is difficult, and the circumstances may be unlikely. It may be that; in the end; we have to live, with the problem and say that an indemnity policy is the answer, but I submit that; we should look very carefully at the issue in. Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is a difficult one; as it is a feature of all these actions that they do not heed to be running; concurrently or as an interim measure for a, more, fundamental matrimonial action, in which a
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
wife obtains am occupancy order, sits in the house and will not raise any other form of matrimonial action such as a divorce action. The husband may or may not be in a position to do so for five years, and his property may men be tied up. One may go to the courts and ask for the waiving of the wife's consent, but that again is an area in which the practical considerations will have to be studied. Having indicated certain areas of concern, I turn briefly to the subject of exclusion orders, which in a sense, although important, present, I believe, fewer difficulties. If we have a situation in which the wife has suffered violence, or the conduct of the husband has caused a form of damage to the wife's mental health, I consider that an exclusion order should be available. It is a considerable widening of the criteria from the Private Member's Bill introduced, by Mr. George Reid when he was a Member of the House of Commons two or three years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enforcement is an interesting facet of the exclusion order. The horn Member for South Angus raised certain interesting issues in respect of clause 14, including the attachment of a power of arrest which " shall be made " by the court without discretion, assuming that a matrimonial interdict has been granted under clause 4. This itself is discretionary but the two may be separated. The matrimonial interdict' may be obtained without asking for the power of: arrest, and at a later stage the court may be asked for the attachment of powers of arrest. At that stage it would be non-discretionary. I use that two-tier operation as an, example of the complications which may arise, and there are others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important question about an exclusion order is, I suggest; will it be used? I quote from English experience as I have had an opportunity of looking at a number of articles dealing with English experience. It is that matrimonial interdicts under the 1976 Act have been used surprisingly seldom in England. I believe that there are complications and difficulties in respect of the machinery set up by the Government, which suggests that we may face similar difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 15, I am a little worried about the strange hybrid procedure, which means that a procurator fiscale, having decided that no proceedings will be taken under criminal law, has still the task of appearing in court as an agent for the applicant, or a. potential applicant, in an action for breach of interdict in civil courts. It is the fiscal who has to appear, explain the case to the sheriff for the continued retention in prison, and presumably ask or invite the court to consider whether the man, who is not to be charged under criminal law, should be held in custody pending, the possibility of a civil action for breach of, interdict. Although I recognise that there are difficulties, however we arrange these matters, I believe that that is- a> novel use of the Crown Office and the servants of the Crown Office. Again, we need to look closely at the subject to see whether there is not a neater and more effective way of; achieving, our aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The whole business about no proceedings in these circumstances will bring us sharply against the entire problem of corroboration. This is a difficult and contentious issue which I submit we must debate, and debate openly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conservative in that I am frightened of breaching the general rule that corroboration is required in all criminal matters. By breaching that rule one may be starting on a road the end of which it is difficult to see. I am conscious, however that the nature of domestic violence is such that corroboration is often hard to obtain. For example, the woman herself may be a witness. One may think that there is sufficient evidence because there are marks of violence on her. Those marks of violence are corroboration of the fact that she has been assualted, but they are not necessarily corroboration of the fact that she has been assualted by her husband. In cases which seem to a layman to be absolutely clear-cut, there may be genuine difficulty about sufficiency of evidence, and that will bulk large in the considerations of the procurator fiscal. That is something that we shall have to consider, although I would not want to commit myself to departing from the law of corroboration in an area of real importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Sringburn (Mr. Martin) made the very important point that the effectiveness of the power of arrest depends to some extent on the attitude of the police. We all know—in a sense it is understandable—that the police are reluctant to get involved in domestic violence and domestic disputes. I have known this happen in many cases. One reason is that, when the case is finally brought to court, the wife may say that she is not prepared to give evidence. Of course, if the charge is one of assault by the husband, she is a compellable witness. Though she may be compellable in the sense that she has to go into the box, no one can make her speak of what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On numerous occasions I have gone to a fiscal on the morning of a trial and said to him, " Bad luck, mate. The wife has been to see me and she is not going to speak up, so we might as well drop it now." Such situations which are inevitable, will understandably colour the attitude of the police. But where there is a matrimonial interdict, where a power of arrest has been attached to it and where the chief constable has been notified, as laid down in the Bill, the police must be persuaded that it is their job to act. It will then be the responsibility of the procurator fiscal, and perhaps ultimately the civil law, to sort out the consequences. Otherwise, our efforts in Committee and the efforts of the Law Commission and of all the other bodies that have fought for this reform will have little result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious, Mr. Henderson that the Solicitor-General will want adequate time in which to reply so I shall make only one final point. I should like to underline what my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton said about clause 12 and the transfer of tenancy. It is absolutely fundamental that we should put nothing on the statute book that would persuade or give an opportunity to an un-cooperative local authority to refuse to consider sympathetically
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
transfer requests which reflect the reality of what has happened in a marriage on the ground that it would be better to wait for a section 12 order from the courts. That would be tragic. It would lead to a great deal of unnecessary litigation. It might lead to the perverse results—my right hon. Friend mentioned them—in which the wife was in fact worse off. It might also lead to the running up of considerable legal aid bills—this point may appeal to hon. Gentlemen on the Conservative Benches— in a totally unnecessary fight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would want to think very carefully about the effects of clause 12 and of the repeals from the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, and to consider whether the compensation concept is necessary. I refer again to the idea of claiming compensation on the ground that one has lost a substantial sum of money because one will no longer be in a position to buy a valuable house on discount. Even if the husband claimed only 50 per cent., on the ground that the other 50 per cent, should remain with the wife, the sum involved, in an extreme case, might amount to several thousand pounds. That is a matter we must consider very closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that any member of the Committee would want to obstruct the Second Reading of the Bill. Its heart is demonstrably in the right place. There is a crying social need for reform and for a redress of the balance between the parties in these difficult situations. We must recognise, however, that the situations are intractable and tragic and that there will be no easy blueprint from the courts into which we can fit matrimonial difficulties so that everyone can walk out of the court satisfied and unhurt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that one income does not easily support two households, and two separate parents cannot separately both have care and control of the children. Particularly relevant to the Bill is that one home cannot accommodate two families, unless it is an unusual home with a west wing, so that the house can be divided to exclude friction. In the vast majority of cases it is an impossible task. In the end somebody will be left with a grievance. The courts will have to make the best of a difficult job. The considerations of justice may sometimes have to be seen in the context of the social realism of the welfare of the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to say that the Bill represents an irreversible shift, but perhaps that has echoes from other areas. The Bill represents a significant shift in the balance of power within the family and gets away from the totally unsatisfactory legal position which left a spouse with no property rights in the matrimonial home and on occasions the position was so weak as to suggest that the legal system was in effect condoning violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could not go on living with that situation. Therefore, I strongly support the Bill. I warn Ministers—and I am sure they welcome this—that it is a Bill of great complication, subtlety, and perhaps, the more one looks at it, unexpected consequences. We shall have to look at the Bill carefully in Committee to make sure that we have got it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to be able to wind up a debate on the first occasion on which you, Mr. Henderson, have taken the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all members of the Committee will feel pleasure in seeing the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) on the Opposition Front Bench, restored to health, even though, on this occasion, in silence. I think that it would be the unanimous will of the Committee that both his good health and silence should be prolonged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government welcome the good reception of the Bill and the constructive and helpful approach of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I think it is recognised on both sides that, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said in his closing sentences, we are trying to resolve matters that are intractible and tragic and often involve dividing things that are indivisible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the first part of the Bill, which concerns the regulation of property, is to establish the position when only one half of the family can occupy the only family house. Frequently, the half of the family whose need to occupy the only family house has been the greater has not been allowed to occupy that house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was inequitable that a situation should continue where the spouse—as various hon. Members have said, usually the mother—who has the children should suffer the penalty of exclusion and home-lessness at an extremely traumatic time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill can do no more than attempt what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) referred to as the judgment of Solomon, but Solomon had only one baby and two mothers to deal with. Here we usually have only one house and two spouses. The Bill seeks to produce equity so far as possible between the spouses in the matter of the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). I emphasise that the major change is the creation of an occupancy right in both spouses, compared with the situation in which the owner had an occupancy right and the non-owner, or non-titled spouse, had what the hon. Member for Garscadden said was a sort of tolerance of squatting so long as he or she was graceful and favoured—or he was graceful and she was favoured! The Bill establishes a new right for both spouses. That is the fundamental purpose and effect of the first part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter which was raised by the right hon. Member for Craigton was the funding of refuges. While that has nothing to do with the Bill, a meeting is taking place today between officials in the Scottish and a sub-committee of COSLA to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member said that a renunciation of a right, referred to in clause 1(6), should be made
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
after compulsorily taking legal advice. That is the first time I have ever heard anyone suggest that a person should be compelled to consult a lawyer. It is a novel practice which perhaps could be extended. I notice that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is not too happy about that. I can understand that all lawyers might be reluctant if it were reciprocal in his case. However, such compulsion would not be satisfactory. A justice of the peace is likely to explain a person's rights. Advice can be obtained through legal aid for 30 minutes. If a person wishes to go to a lawyer, he can. I do not wish to live in any system in which seeking the advice of a lawyer ever becomes compulsory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman in favour of the breaking of the solicitor's monopoly on conveyancing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be improper for me to comment about a matter which does not fall within the ambit of the Bill. I suppose that if one has such a pathological dislike of solicitors as to prevent one buying a house through them, one could live under the bridges instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an occupancy right is arranged under clause 3, it may de facto amount to an exclusion. For example, if a couple have two flats and the occupancy right provided that one party lived in one flat and the other party lived in the other, that would be a mutual exclusion or a de facto exclusion of one spouse from the other flat and the other spouse from the first flat. Arrangements under clause 3 might amount to exclusion de facto. Such arrangements under clause 4(2) could be the subject of an exclusion order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Member for Craigton believes that there is a gap between the stringent requirements to be established in order to obtain an exclusion order and what he might call a sort of surreptitious exclusion order under clause 3, I am sure that we shall consider sympathetically anything which fills that gap. I do not think that it is necessary, but I understand that he would not want a surreptitious exclusion order under clause 3, and under clause 4 a situation in which the party had to be branded as an undesirable and violent person in order to obtain ah exclusion order. It is a valid point and we shall look into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to clause 6, which deals with a matter that troubles us all. To find a solution is extremely difficult. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Galloway (Mr. Lang) and South Angus (Mr. Fraser), together with the hon. Member for Garscadden, that a bona fide third party who buys a house should not be put at a disadvantage because the unknown wife turns up from Australia three years later. The difficulty is that one cannot prove a negative. The hon. Member for Garscadden cannot prove that he is not married. He can prove that he is married, but he is not able to prove to us that he did not marry Brigitte Bardot in a register office in Paris last night. The evidence of his vigour this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
morning is an indication that that was unlikely— that is, if young French women understand the necessity of consumation of marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is important and intractable. We might consider some concept such as the limitation of time under which the spouse could exercise the right. But there may be difficulties in respect of that too. We are giving urgent consideration to the matter, a solution to which, if we are not to breach the protection of the non-titled spouse, is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of compensation under clause 12, in the private sector there might be a lease which could be transferred for value. Clearly it would be wrong if a person could obtain a transferable asset without compensation to the person from whom that asset had been obtained compulsorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway asked what the English experience was. The English experience is varied. We must understand that in the Bill we are attempting to deal with marriages and property situations which will be of infinite variety. I do not think that it is useful to look at the English experience as a particularly good guide, to what our experience may be in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway asked about casual relationships and the difficulties which arise in clause 16 in respect of cohabiting couples. I agree that this is an area into which we should wander with caution, because the protection of subsection (5) to the married spouse, whereby the occupancy rights end on divorce or the ending of marriage, could in no circumstances apply to cohabiting couples of whatever strength, duration or casuality. There is no legal process by which the relationship can ever be ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there are anomalies and difficulties. No doubt the Committee will want to consider carefully the question of the extent to which cohabiting spouses should be protected. On the other hand, with the abolition of the regular forms of marriage many people may live together for long periods, and they should have protection in circumstances in which they may be made homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) was worried about household furniture. If the hon. Gentleman looks at subsection (5), he will see that household furniture is covered. It is also covered in clause 3 (2). Furniture owned or hired, therefore, is covered by the Bill. However, I understand his anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question whether there should be corroboration of violence. I shall deal with the criminal matter in a moment. Of course, the spouse must be believed. The court will have to take fairly strong and far-reaching actions, and clearly corroboration would be beneficial. But the spouse must establish that the application is bona fide and not merely spiteful or vicious. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
hon. Gentleman also raised the matter of tied houses which is dealt with in clause 12 (7).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus asked particularly that the third party should not be affected in terms of clause 6. Perhaps that is a matter to which he can give his attention and obtain the golden apple for finding a solution. He asked if the matrimonial interdict and power of arrest were mandatory. They are mandatory. As the hon. Member for Garscadden said, if one were to apply for the interdict and then provide for the power of arrest, it is possible they could be obtained mandatorily in that form. We shall certainly have to see if the procedure can be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to adjust the concept of protecting the spouse by interdict in what is half a civil dispute and half a criminal act in circumstances of domestic tension. That is the method that we have come up with and we hope that it will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Fife, Central said, this law is an attempt to adjust human behaviour. The motivation of human behaviour is something which not even he, I think, would claim to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the Bill will not prevent spouses from assaulting one another. I regret that it will not prevent domestic unhappiness or domestic dispute. The most that we can claim for the Bill is that, in the unhappy circumstance of domestic dispute, it will make more equitable the results that flow from that dispute, and in the event of violence, continued violence will not be necessitated because one of the spouses either has no alternative but to go back and live with the violence or have nowhere else to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Garscadden said, frequently, a client may say " I shall not give evidence against my husband ", because after mature thought she has said to herself either " I shall give it another try for the umpteenth time" or " What shall I do and where shall I go if I give evidence against him? ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is an attempt to solve the difficulties of a spouse who cannot escape from the cage of violence. We hope that the provisions in the Bill will go a long Way if not to preventing violence, at least to preventing its unnecessary repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Bill to the Committee. I am sure that our future discussions will be constructive and fruitful and will make the Bill as adequate as possible in very difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
