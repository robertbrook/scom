<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a specific area of information that is contentious. There is a considerable debate and division of opinion as to the desirability of publishing certain information about school activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most schools now produce prospectuses, which can take a variety of forms. Many schools have held competitions and have ensured that the information is presented in attractive folders, and the school students are encouraged to become involved in the production of the prospectus. There is usually a fair degree of discussion among the staff about what should be included in it. Principal teachers are given a responsibility to set out as lucidly as possible the details of the course options that their departments provide—I am talking in this instance about secondary schools—and there is normally information about mixed ability teaching, and clear indications of what the common course in the first and second years will cover. There is also, in most instances, fairly detailed
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
information about the general educational philosophy of the school. Obviously that has to be watered down, because many parents are not acquainted with the academic or educational jargon. Nevertheless, there is a common body of knowledge that is included in the prospectuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak here with a certain degree of caution, Mr. Gourlay, because it has been drawn to my attention that the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council is currently carrying out a survey, on which it will base a report, on the extent to which school prospectuses are used and what is included in them. By their precipitate rush to force the legislation through, especially on this matter, which is one of the most controversial parts of the Bill, the Government are running ahead of the valuable survey being carried out by the council. I am sure that the debate would be better informed if this information were available. In the debate on the first sittings motion I said—in the light of my consultations with that group—that we would have been better informed if we had been able to consider this survey in, perhaps, a cooler atmosphere. A great deal of heat has been generated about this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition accept that many of the Minister's proposed regulations are relatively innocuous. We are not unduly preoccupied with the regulations and the information for parents, because such methods often exist already in well-run schools, as more and more schools become conscious of the need to explain to parents what they are doing. One theme which has not been sufficiently stressed in our debates is that for too long there has been a lack of accountability in our education system and there has not been sufficient public knowledge of what has been happening in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old dictum says that schools were built for children, not for teachers. For too long, many schools have been run in the interests of the teachers or what the teachers perceive to be the best interests of the children, with no adequate concern for the needs of the community or the individual pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More and more schools are now assuming community responsibilities. Probably one of the most successful ones is operated by the Lothian region at the Westerhailes community school, which is an ambitious and exciting education centre. I speak from personal knowledge, because my wife worked there for some time and was involved in setting the school up. It serves a large housing estate in Edinburgh. It makes its objectives clear to the community. There is almost a marriage between the school council and the community council in the area, and there is a clear identity and commitment to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information included in the broadsheets and information sheets provided by the Westerhailes education centre are the ideal means of communicating to parents the information they require when making judgments about their children's education. It is important that the range of course choices should be made clear and also the curriculum structure, the options available, and the examination arrangements available to the children. The preoccupation with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
results is regrettable and will force us to oppose this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examination results by themselves are misleading, because of the manner of their presentation. I make no bones about this, because pretty well anything can be proved' from examination statistics. The position on examination results is complicated. I shall go through the types of examinations which are open to children in Scottish schools. The examinations organised by the Scottish examination board are the O-grades and the higher grade Scottish certificate of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the raising of the school leaving age, there has been an attempt to bring more children into the ambit of the O-grade examination, which now has five levels, from A to E. The letters D and E mean a fail. A certificate is issued which states that a child has achieved a certain level in the O-grade exam. Therefore, it is possible for a child to receive a certificate when, quite clearly, he has not met the standard required by the examination board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of marks in D level is between 40 and 49 and the marks in E level is between 30 and 39. It is in some respects a recognition of the youngster's having completed the course, but it is not really an adequate yardstick of his educational performance. It creates an illusion that the exam has been passed, whereas he has not met the required standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister propose to take account of D and E levels? In my experience as a former teacher, I found that it was often a source of encouragement to youngsters, and certainly an encouragement to the teachers, when effort could be recognised'. One of the problems which was created by the raising of the school leaving age was that the O-grade exam was based on a different school population from that at present. There are now more youngsters of middle ability staying on and the O-grade exam does not meet their requirements. As a compromise the D and E levels were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a source of consolation to youngsters who have started off their courses, perhaps without much hope of passing, to be told that they achieved between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, in the exam and if they tried hard next year, they might pass. The encouragement given to youngsters to take such an examination is justified	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup -->. Nevertheless, it makes it difficult to produce neat and tidy league tables showing three categories of O-grade examination passes—those who achieved over 50 per cent., those over 40 per cent, and those over 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because some children achieved only 40 per cent, it does not necessarily mean that that should be a shadow or spot being cast on the sohool. It could mean that a fair amount of effort had been made. The results could show that a great deal has been done with children of middle ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that parents will be looking at examination results to ascertain the numbers who passed. Even there, we have to take account of the fact that these bald statistics are, to say the least, misleading. The number of pupils who pass an exam does not always reflect the number who could have been presented. One of the difficulties which we
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
foresee is that some schools will start to prevent young people from being presented. We know already that there are provisions in the Bill which could be construed as a means of making it more difficult for local authorities to provide funds for the cost of presenting youngsters for examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that young people who meet the course requirements in that they attend regularly and perform reasonably well—I say no more than that—in the preliminary examinations should be entitled to be presented for examination. None of us would argue that youngsters should be presented for examinations when they have no chance of success. But there are strong grounds for allowing youngsters to be presented when they can show that their work has improved over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that I am beginning to strain your patience, Mr. Gourlay, so I shall try to make my point as succinctly as possible. The published figures would not necessarily require schools to say how many pupils were presented for examinations, so that the picture could be distorted. I refer to the regulations that have been provided by the education department as a guide. That is really what we are talking about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and it is difficult to make a ruling without being too strict or too lenient, but the regulations will be discussed when they come before the House. It is not the Committee's function to discuss them this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Gourlay. I was trying to say that the regulations would probably not come before the House for some time and that we consider the status quo to be perfectly acceptable in that we do not need the regulations. But we have to advance reasons for opposing them, and those reasons must refer to their content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, we do not accept that examination results that are put down in a bald fashion will necessarily cover every eventuality. I am trying to highlight the fact that there is a restrictive approach in some schools concerning the presentation of pupils for examination. That restrictive approach—only backing winners, so to speak—could distort the percentage figures. When there is considerable youth unemployment, young people doubt whether it is worth the candle to commit themselves to courses of study because, even if they pass their O-grades, they wonder whether they will get the sort of jobs that would have been possible years ago. In that climate we must try to ensure that as many youngsters as possible are given the opportunity and are encouraged to sit those examinations so that, although the subjects taken may not be within their grasp, they can at least put up a good show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the bald way in which the figures would be presented would not take account of the circumstances. Some headmasters, in trying to present their schools in what they believe to be the best possible light, will seek to doctor the figures by preventing some youngsters from taking examina
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
tions. That happens already in some schools, where principal teachers adopt a restrictive attitude to presentation. I believe that the prime consideration should be the welfare of the child rather than the pride or the prejudice of headmasters. The regulations will provide opportunities for headmasters to indulge themselves in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that there are many other considerations, which my hon Friends will doubtless raise, about schools in certain areas which cannot possibly produce the academic standards that appear to be the hallmark of other institutions, even in the local authority sector. I say that because in some areas where parental commitment is higher and the social infrastructure is stronger the children can be more easily encouraged to see academic study as desirable in itself. But even within our mixed educational system—by which I mean that there is a varying level of academic achievement within our schools—many schools do not achieve high pass rates in external examinations, but nevertheless provide excellent academic courses for those who need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments that in certain schools a low premium is placed upon academic achievement and that there is coercion by some children against those who are more willing to work, are now out of date and no longer relevant. There are many schools in which we are able to ensure that, despite the social and economic deprivation surrounding them, the schools themselves, often because of positive discrimination by local authorities, are now catering for the academically committed child in a way which they were not doing five or 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not teach in a school-of that kind in Lothian region, but in some schools a great deal of emphasis is placed on the importance of ensuring that those who have the ability are given the chance to fulfil it. Four or five years ago, just after the raising of the school-leaving age, there was confusion and some measure of despondency in the teaching profession about the level of provision. But that has now been changed, and within large housing estates many schools which before were regarded as academic twilight zones are now providing youngsters with a wide range of courses and opportunities to sit exams. Those youngsters are taking those opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers that we are talking about are not necessarily dramatic. Some days ago I made a comparison for the benefit of the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who I know takes an interest in educational matters, because it is a somewhat novel experience for him. He told me that he had been to Scottish schools, but I cannot imagine that he went to local authority schools. If he did I shall be more than happy to stand corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two schools in the hon Gentleman's constituency—the Royal high school and Craigroyston. One serves a predominantly middle-class area, and the other serves what can only be described as one of the areas of severest economic and social deprivation (in Scotland, namely the Pilton and West Pilton housing estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both of those schools in their own way serve the communities for which they have responsibility. But the interesting point about the Craigroyston school is
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
that a tremendous amount of work is being done there to compensate for the economic and social deprivation. There is now a fair amount of what could be called academic work in terms of examinations. By any league table one school would not compare favourably with the other, if the basis of comparison were the number of classes. But we should consider whether the youngsters who wish to study are given the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided the level of financial support from the authorities is given, we think that all schools should be treated equally and should not be subject to criteria which are at best grossly misleading when presented in the simplistic form that 'the Minister is seeking to use in the regulations. Not only is the form simplistic in terms of passes and failures, and so on, but the range of examinations covered—the SCE ordinary and higher, and sixth-year study awards—is far too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many schools now provide different courses of study for children. For example, some schools in the Lothian region and in other parts of Scotland provide Northern region examination board courses. The CSE mode 3 courses, which adapt very well to the needs of schools that do not have a preponderance of academically committed youngsters, can lead to O-grade-equivalent passes. Those courses are not covered by the regulations, but they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schools are taking a different route, and use pupil profiles, which are extremely difficult to put down in the neat and tidy form that the bookkeeper in St. Andrew's House would like. We argue that it is wrong to set down arrangements for comparison that may need to be altered quickly when—for good reasons or bad—the Munn and Dunning recommendations may soon be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the regulations need to be placed before the House, but if the basis of comparison will be relevant for only two years and the local authorities cannot provide information this year, none will be available until the academic year 1982-83. By 1983-84, many schools will be moving into the Munn and Dunning scheme, for good reasons or bad. We have yet to see full provision of courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the schools that I have visited where Munn and Dunning work is being done, there is enthusiasm in some staff and caution din others. Many misgivings have been expressed about the scheme, partly because of the lack of financial provision from the Government, and partly because of the difficulties that many teachers foresee in taking time off to prepare for the new courses. That is the reason for my qualifications on the acceptance of Munn and Dunning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Munn and Dunning schemes, or other schemes, are introduced early in the life of this system, any comparison between one school and another will be even more misleading. The regulations would be ill-advised for sound educational reasons. The concentration of examination results in a restricted form would not take account of the social backgrounds of pupils who attend the school. There may be competition between headmasters in areas where reactionary local authorities may take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
the league tables as a statement of headmasters' performances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that an opportunity .to vote against the regulations will arise when they are presented to the House. But at this stage we feel that this part of the Bill is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would have been happier if the legislation had been delayed to allow the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council survey to be produced, so that we could see exactly what was involved in their study of prospectuses. We are fairly confident that well-run schools, under responsible education authorities, are being encouraged to provide a great deal of information at every level. Most of the information that would be requested by the Minister under the regulations is already being made available, and, therefore, the regulations are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to examinations, it would not be helpful at present to the youngsters, the parents, or the staff in the schools if performances were to be judged by means of external criteria that we consider to be at best deficient. We should like to see section 28B removed from the Bill before 'the Committee proceeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am surprised at the official Opposition's objection to the subsection. I know very well that the provision about publication of examination results is a contentious matter—I shall say something about it in due course—but that is no excuse for throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and section 28B undoubtedly represents a considerable extension of the provision of information to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first things we must realise, in dealing with the school system, is that schools are intended for the consumers. They exist for the benefit not of those who run them, or the education authorities, or the councils that wrangle over finances and courses, but of the consumers—the children and, behind the children, the parents. The parents provide support, they are interested, and at that stage in their children's careers they have to take decisions based on the information they are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by a remark made by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), whose knowledge of the education system I acknowledge. The hon Gentleman said that there was no problem, because well-run schools, encouraged by the education authorities, already provided the information required in the new section 28B—although he made a proviso about the publication of examination results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what happens when schools are not well run or when there is some deficiency in a school? Is it in order for an education authority to allow a cover-up in that school and to prevent the consumers—the parents or the children—knowing that there is, for example, a staff problem in the school? There might be, for instance, a dispute between rectors and other members of staff about discipline. In a small minority of schools, such things occasionally happen. If there is such a problem in a school it is desirable that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
should be exposed, because then, and then only, probably, will the education authority grasp the thistle, move in and try to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a deficiency in the administration of a certain school, for instance, or a deficiency in discipline, it is desirable that action be taken. Again, there might be problems in relation to options available to parents. For instance, parents might be placed in a quandary by a lack of provision for physics, chemistry or mathematics. If that problem were made public, it would then be the duty of the education authority to step in and transfer resources to the school, particularly if it happened to be in a deprived area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only schools in deprived areas, however, that have difficulties. Problems based upon personality clashes, for instance, may arise in schools in any part of any region, and in those circumstances I think that the provision of basic information as suggested in section 28B would be desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am in some doubt about whether, in the circumstances described by the hon Gentleman, a school will actually publish information to the effect that it has no discipline or that it is badly administered. It is the school and the local authority that will be responsible for publishing the information. I do not think that the information that the hon Gentleman thinks should be available to parents will in fact be made available as a result of section 28B. It is more likely to become available under the present arrangements, when local authorities carry out their own inspections of schools and Her Majesty's inspectors also carry out inspections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon Gentleman. Some of the information required will be of a statistical nature, and it would be very difficult for a local authority or a school to cover that up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think section 28B would enable further information to be made available to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman's argument is one of desperation. He says that whatever regulations are made there could very well be a cover-up by the education authority and the school. We must not forget that both those bodies would have to be involved, and that it would be necessary for the education authority to permit the school to conduct the cover-up. I do not think that any responsible education authority would go along with such a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the passage on staff morale and industrial relations. Are we to have a paragraph which says "We had 14 strikes this year. We had five teachers who refused to take extra classes. We had six people who were persistently off ill whenever they had difficult classes"? Is such information to be included? It is not in the regulations. It would be dangerous to draw such conclusions from the information available. I do not think that the Minister wants that, and if that is the way that the hon Member is thinking it is a dangerous precedent, because misinformation would be provided, upon which half-baked conclusions—such as he seeks to draw—would be based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Where there are staff difficulties which impinge on the educational standards of schools, they begin to show in the way in which the school is managed and in the courses provided—for instance, by not having sufficient teachers to provide third-year options of subjects which are in short supply. A parent ought to be informed at the outset, from a school prospectus, if a certain school has difficulty in providing physics teaching for pupils who do not have extraordinary ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know one school that ran into that problem. The pupils who were to be discriminated against in that school were those who had—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. ALBERT MCQUARRIE 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McQuarrie, and hope that you survive the sometimes unmannerly conduct of members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of one school where, in relation to third-year options, physics teaching was to be made available to the able pupils but not to the less able pupils, because it was considered that the able pupils were better able to benefit from the teaching of physics. That is not necessarily so, because pupils who might not necessarily be brilliant at physics might wish to study physics and take the O-grade examination in physics, so that they could take a nursing or some other paramedical course, even if they did not intend to go to university and take an honours degree in physics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such information is desirable. I shall quote a paragraph from the letter of 27 February 1981 that we have all received from the Scottish Consumer Council:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We see the provision of information for parents as being of fundamental importance. Only with access to relevant information can parents begin to participate effectively in their child's schooling. Moreover, information can also help clear up any misapprehensions that parents might have about their children's schooling. Thus, better information will not necessarily make parents more critical of schools, but it will help them to make sensible decisions. The SCC recognises that handbooks, prospectuses and reports cannot be a substitute for face-to-face parental contact with education staff, but we also recognise that some parents do find it difficult to visit their child's school or approach teaching staff."</p></blockquote>
It says that this is a problem, and it is one from which Members of Parliament are not exempt. I rarely manage to get to my own children's school, because the days when such visits are arranged are days on which the House is sitting—as occurred on Monday last. The SCC says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We favour examination results being made available to parents, but only provided that the results are presented in their educational and social context."</p></blockquote>
I shall deal with that later.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that parents should have a right to inspect school records on their child—and since 40 per cent, of a sample of schools say they already do this, according to an unpublished survey, this practice should be made universal."</p></blockquote>
It also says in the last part of the letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would also suggest that reports by inspectors on schools and at an education authority level should be made readily available to parents . . . following the recent examples of the ILEA and HMIs in England and Wales making their reports public."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
That takes care of the point made a moment ago by the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who now seems to have left the room, either for coffee or in the face of the evidence presented by the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official Opposition are in danger of throwing out the baby with the bath water. Section 28B provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall … publish or … make available information as to … the placing of children in schools … such other matters as may be prescribed by regulations",</p></blockquote>
and also in relation to schools under its management, and so on. It goes on to give all sorts of conditions under which the regulations will take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has a copy of those regulations, which certainly at first glance appear to be very reasonable. One paragraph, to which I shall refer later, may require to be tightened up in regard to publication of examination results, but by and large I think that the regulations are intended to help parents choose subjects. The provision of that information, according to standard guidelines laid down for all schools within the education authority area, will also help to find those schools that are not being treated fairly and equally under the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Members of Parliament receive complaints from parents. If we request information from the local authority we frequently find that one or other school has been treated deficiently in the supply of teachers, and so on. Very quietly and efficiently the education authority makes that good, because it wants to be seen to be treating schools as fairly and equally as it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities are under an obligation to help schools in deprived areas in particular, yet sometimes we find that the schools are not given the number of remedial teachers, and so on, to which they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any rate, a valid point has been made about the regulations on examinations. I shall not plough through the draft regulations, except to say that the information provided	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> for is by and large unexceptional. I refer hon Members in particular to regulations 8(a) to (f). I also .refer to regulation 9{iv), which I believe is valuable. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No parent shall be refused any part of the basic information which he may request."</p></blockquote>
Regulation 11(d) refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"authority's general policy on school curriculum and examinations".</p></blockquote>
Regulation 11(e) refers to Gaelic-speaking areas. The Opposition have tabled a useful amendment in relation to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also refer the Minister to regulation 12(n), which speaks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a secondary school, the examinations, national and otherwise, for which pupils may be entered; policy on presentations; the number of pupils achieving SCE Ordinary or Higher Grade or CSYS awards in the preceding session by subject and band compared with the number of pupils in S4, S5 and S6, separately for each year".</p></blockquote>
Here I share the more general view of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, who suggested that there could be a danger of non-relevant presentation of information, or information taken out of context, as was indicated by the Scottish Consumer Council. The council is in favour of information being made available but it prefers it to be accurately expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that schools could become too strictly tagged to the examination system. That is another educational subject which could be discussed—whether the whole curriculum should be dictated by examinations—but I shall leave that aside. If a spotlight is played upon examination results, there is a danger that some headmasters, in order to protect their school, will tend to select better pupils and reduce the opportunities for less able pupils to be presented. That may happen particularly if financial constraints are placed upon local authorities which will affect the number of examination entrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem faced by the Minister and, indeed, education authorities is the Munn and Dunning report. If we move on to a new examination structure, which will fill a gap in the present system, it will be difficult at the early transitional stages of that system for information on presentation to be made available. If the whole examination system were moving into a kind of whirlpool caused by the radical changes that will take place, the method by
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
which information on presentation could be expressed would be affected by the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an example. A school which has been presenting some pupils for O-grade who stand a chance of achieving the D or E standard, mentioned by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, would more likely present some of those pupils for the new examination on the basis that the .pass which could be achieved under the new examination will give greater encouragement to the pupil and will be of greater value when assessing the worth of pupils when they seek jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there will be a major impact on some schools when the change is introduced, because the number of pupils who will be presented for O-grade examinations will go down just as they will go up under the new structure. Certain schools may find the impact far more radical than others. The wrong impression may be created from that—that the quality of the school has deteriorated, and that may not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Minister should look more closely at regulation (n), which is at present in draft. I know that we shall be able to vote on the regulations later, but we may not have much opportunity of discussing them. However, the policy on presentation must be made very clear, so that the problem that I mentioned can be catered' for. If Munn and Dunning were to be taken out, I do not think that many people would object to a year-by-year comparison in a school—in S4, S5 and S6 in presentation by subject and band—because that could show its development in its own context over the years. Although we must always remember that much depends on the inflow of pupils, any deterioration in teaching standards and so forth would be shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But care must be taken where there is a contrast between one school and another over presentation, where the fault may not be that of the school, the teaching, or the resources. Otherwise, the Minister could find that a substantial hole had been knocked in the fabric of the senior secondary system. Therefore, I ask him, at least at this stage, to take my remarks on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument, which is based on regulations that have not yet been finalised', would not make me vote against the amendment. The amendment is to take away the subsection, and there is a strong reason for the subsection. I believe that guidelines should be given both by the Secretary of State and by the education authority in relation to the information that is to be presented. If there is a problem such as that raised by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire and me with regard to presentation and the impact of Munn and Dunning, especially on the school curriculum and the examination structure, it should be taken into account a little better than it is in respect of regulation 12(n).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Party shows that it has tried to maximise parental choice in education. Our objection to the Tory philosophy through the ages—not just over the last decade or so—is that it has, in a sense, tried to deny working-class parents effective choice in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was born and brought up in a working-class area and was subject to all sorts of economic stringencies which restricted choice of educational facilities, and so on. In fact there was no choice for us. There is still no effective choice for many hundreds of thousands of parents throughout Scotland, and the passing of the Bill will not result in any increase of choice either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection that we are discussing can be compared with taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There is little evidence that more than a very small number of parents in Scotland have complaints about the existing system, and they have remedies at local level. I cite the example of Fife. It has had a scheme of parental choice in primary schools since August 1980. It is a Labour-controlled authority and it produced a document on the choice of primary school in the form of question and answer, which was widely publicised and circulated. After running the scheme for a while, Fife has found that about 2 per cent, of parents have sought to have their children admitted to a school other than the local one. But the greater proportion of that 2 per cent, would have received approval in any case under Fife's previous arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, Fife's provision for revealing to parents availability of choice, and the way in which it went about it, was adequate. Its views on this proposed subsection is that the provisions are already adequately covered by section 29 of the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dundee, East said that much of the information would be of a statistical character. That is true, but it would be much more than that, according to the document produced by the Department. We had better face the fact that many parents would be unable to absorb all the implications of the information to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area there are parents who are at a loss to understand what is going on in the local school. They are content to send their children to that school and leave the local education authority and the school staff to deal with the children as they think appropriate. Very few parents consciously and willingly participate in the way in which their local school is run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the Opposition's strongest arguments earlier in the debate was that the selected places scheme and the placement scheme could denude certain schools of parental involvement. The main reason behind that belief is that for every school there will be a number of parents who will follow the system and will not be able to view it critically. But in each school there may be a minority of parents who do consider the system critically. They are the ones who could benefit from the information provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point. The parents with whom I am concerned are those who
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
will not benefit from the provisions because the information suggested is so diffuse and general as to be meaningless to the vast majority of parents whom I represent. Those who will benefit are middle and upper class—the educated and articulate who will understand such things. The more literate parents will benefit, but a large number of working-class parents will not understand the implications. The discrepancy between one section of the community and another will increase as a result of these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not explain myself clearly enough, and if I did not, the hon Gentleman has certainly taken advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school councils and individual parents who see from the information provided certain trends developing, could publicise that and put pressure on the education authority for remedial action. So it can apply collectively as well as individually, and not in the way that the hon Gentleman suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now discussing my amendment No. 46, which is to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"make available such information as it"</p></blockquote>
—the local education authority—
	<br><blockquote><p>"thinks appropriate for".</p></blockquote>
I say that because when the Minister referred to the amendments that we had tabled on the school councils, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would be wrong to lay down provisions in these matters, which are best decided locally."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 5</i> March 1981; 	<i>c.</i> 65.]</p></blockquote>
That is an admirable principle. In Fife we know that the local education authority, being a Labour authority, knows the type of parents with which it is dealing. The local education authority, and not the man in St. Andrew's House, knows best how to widen parental choice in educational matters. Its record is impeccable in these matters. For the Scottish Office—and the Under-Secretary and the present Secretary of State for Scotland, who were educated in public schools—to lay down how Fife local education authority should organise things is an insult and an absurdity, and is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to one or two of the points in the regulations. Little or no mention has been made so far of the financial implications of these proposals. The Government were conscious of these matters in their draft regulations. I quote from regulation 3(a), (b) and (c):
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) the regulations must cover all the information which is essential to parents".</p></blockquote>
It does not say what information is available to parents. Information which is necessary for one parent may not be the information required by another parent. So presumably they have to go across the whole gamut tocover every possibility. Then there is 3(b):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the regulations must ensure that the information is easily accessible".</p></blockquote>
It does not say how or where. Is it to be in the newspapers, or the local education offices, St. Andrew's House, or the police station or the post office? it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and that its existence is widely publicised".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
That means money from the local authorities, and the Government are clobbering the local authorities on their education and other expenditure. Then 3(c) says:
	<br><blockquote><p> "in the interests of restricting public expenditure and reducing the administrative burden on education authorities, the regulations should however limit the obligation on education authorities to hand out information unasked".</p></blockquote>
In other words, if a parent does not have the wit or the knowledge to ask for the information, it will not be given. I return to the point that the parents who are likely to ask for it are those who are more conscious of the existing provisions of the education authority. The parents who will be helped by this are those who do not need the help. The parents who are not likely to be helped are those who most need help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I continue with paragraph 3(c):
	<br><blockquote><p>"limit the obligation on education authorities to hand out information unasked: provided the availability of information about alternative schools is widely known, for example, the onus can rest on parents who want it to ask for it".</p></blockquote>
That again is a division between one set of parents and another. It is, generally speaking, the differentiation between working-class parents and others who may be more articulate and in a higher social class. Some parents send their children to schools, or seek to choose a school, on social grounds. Many parents send their kids to private schools on social rather than educational grounds. Why should not the education authority be obliged to provide a breakdown of the background of children in a school in terms of social classes 1 to 5? That is a factor that will influence the examination record of a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present Government there are limitations on the provision of school milk, school dinners and clothing, and there is massive unemployment. Some children are going to school with no breakfast, and then they are not getting a midday meal. If they sit examinations in that half-starved state, the examination results may not be as good as those of a school in a more prosperous suburban area. Those are important considerations that affect a school's examination record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question of the financial implications. On page v of the explanatory and financial memorandum we read that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The duty of education authorities to comply with parents' requests as to schools … mainly affects expenditure by local authorities. It is estimated that additional expenditure of about £100,000 in 1981/82 and about £300,000 in subsequent years could be involved for authorities in connection with publicity for school admission arrangements and the setting up of appeal committees."</p></blockquote>
The Government presume, therefore, that expenditure will be incurred as a result of the proposals that we are discussing, and I suspect that the figures will be much greater than those given in the memorandum. But the Government are cutting back expenditure on education; one has only to look at the public expenditure white paper to see how education will be affected. I suspect that the Bill, like many others, is a con trick. It is a declaration of intent. It is a pretence, at no cost to the Government, that something is being done for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are cutting back in many fields but say that as an exception they will spend £5,000 million on Trident. They are spending money on expensive weapons, but they will not spend much
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
more on education. The Government's priorities have made necessary this massive confidence trick on the people of Scotland—people who are very interested in the education of their children. Neither section 28B nor the Bill as a whole will make one iota of difference to the quality of education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled an amendment on the question of examinations; it will be considered separately. I shall have plenty to say about examinations. I have taught—in England, not in Scotland—in schools of all kinds, and I know that the publication of examination results can be completely misleading. Both north and south of the border the Government have, on many occasions, made it a great point—almost a point of principle—that schools should publish examination results. That would be educationally disastrous, misleading, and indefensible. It would lead to ghetto schools. It would lead to apartheid in the education system, and that is something we are profoundly opposed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has consulted local education authorities on these matters. Does he know how many of them regard this part of the Bill as essential and how many think that it could improve the quality of educational provision in their areas? That is the crux of the matter. Unless the Bill achieves that, it is superfluous and nonsense. I hope that the Minister will say how local authorities have reacted to this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am a little divided about the issue, because I believe very much in the principle that parents should be involved in the school and in the education of their children. The children should also be involved and should know what their courses are about. As someone who believes that, I find it difficult to oppose absolutely the idea that parents and children should be given information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon Friend's objections to the way in which this part of the Bill has been worded, and to the regulations proposed by the Secretary of State. We should take this part of the Bill out and think again, so that the Government can have time to think a little more carefully about the matter and see whether they can come up with a better system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have reservations, as my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) would say, about this being something imposed from above upon local authorities, which will in turn affect schools and parents, on what sort of information should be made available. That is the wrong approach. It is remarkable that the Government, who argued in their election manifesto for greater local democracy and for more ability for local authorities to decide what should happen in their own areas, have consistently, in Bill after Bill, eroded local autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives another example of that erosion. The Government are imposing upon local authorities certain duties which they do not have at present, those duties are exact, although the information may be vague. That is the wrong way in which to approach this problem. I think that local authorities should provide information. Parents should have a right to know what sort of courses are available and what examinations their children can take. Parents should know about a school's disciplinary procedures, about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
extra-curricular activities and what is available, other than just formal education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the way in which exact information is to be given should be left to the authority or even to the schools. School councils may be best able to give such information about a school, because they represent the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major objection is to the idea that external examination results should be published. The thought behind that seems to be that somehow or other it will benefit parents when they choose a school. As all my hon Friends have said, anyone who has been involved in education knows that that is grossly misleading. Clearly, examination results will be better in schools in middle-class areas than those in working-class areas. I do not deny that; it is plain fact. But whether it has anything to do with the school is open to question, because other factors must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mere fact that a school is of a certain social mix inevitably means that there will be parents who are themselves educated and who will provide a home environment that is based at least on some educational factors, such as the availability of books, the guidance of children along the right lines, and so on. They will also help their children in reading, writing and arithmetic when those children go to primary school. Therefore, it is inevitable that the children will have a home background of learning that will make it easier for them to tackle the external examination system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has nothing to do with the school. Middle-class parents want their children to succeed in the examination system, and they provide them with a much greater incentive than many other parents. That again distorts the examination system. But it would not matter what school the children attended; they would probably still pass their examinations, because their parents would be pushing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that articulate parents will kick up a row when things go wrong or when certain courses are not provided, and they will therefore probably get what they want. Articulation is one of the major benefits that anyone can have, because the possession of that ability means that the pressure that can be put on the local authority or the school is greater than when the ability to articulate is not present. Therefore, the school will benefit in a way that other schools cannot because of the parents and because of the area, rather than because of the idea that its teachers are somehow better, which is not true. Other factors outside the school come together to make it produce good examination results which look better on paper but which have little or nothing to do with the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a sort of league table of examination results for different schools, it would show a disparity in results which would be extremely misleading. It would give the impression that school A down the road had good examination results, with the result that parents would think that if they sent their child there he would inevitably pass examinations, along with the other children. But that does not follow. It is not inevitable, and it misleads parents if they think that that will be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which schools would consider the
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
examination results, and the way in which they would try to put out information in a manner favourable to themselves would also be misleading. As my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said, some schools allow children to sit the final examination only if they have passed the preliminary examination, or if they have come very close to passing it. Some may not be aware of this, but if someone has sat the preliminary examination and passed, but fails the final examination in April or May, the school may make an appeal on his behalf and give evidence that may allow him to get through. If he or she has failed, the possibilities of a successful appeal are small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to the House I was an assistant examiner for the O-level and higher history examinations in Scotland, and I was a marker for some years. I therefore have some knowledge of what went on. I cannot impart that knowledge, because it would be against the code that examiners have to obey, but I have some idea of how the appeals procedure works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools may well set the preliminary examination and say that those who have passed, and perhaps two below the pass line, will be allowed to sit, and the rest will not. There is then a fair chance that the majority will pass the final examination. A publication can then be issued to parents saying that out of the 100 who sat the examination, 95 passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That looks good. The parents will say "That is good. They get 95 per cent, of the children through the exam." But that will not give a true picture, because many children will have been excluded from sitting the examination. If the words included in the clause are put into the regulations and become law, there will be positive encouragement for schools—which, at least for the next few years, will be operating with a declining school population—to carry out such a procedure to make it appear that they are good at getting children through examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be damaging, because I know that the assessment of children made by schools in a preliminary examination is often much stricter and harder than that of the examination board. Many children fail preliminary examinations and then pass if they are allowed to sit the public examinations. I have seen this time and time again. Children may not do well in prelims, then either they do an extra three or four months' hard work and manage to get themselves up, or the standard of the examination board is slightly lower than the school examination and the result is that they are able to pass the O-level or higher examination that they require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If schools start excluding those children from even sitting the examination, large numbers who would have passed the examination will not even be allowed to sit it, just to satisfy the schools' desire to show that they are better than other schools at getting children through examinations. That would be dangerous, not just for the individual children concerned, but for our national economy, because we need to have more passing through our examination system in order to develop our economy as it should be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not learnt that there is a direct link between economic performance and our education system. The Government are imposing financial cuts on every education establishment in the

country, which makes it clear that they have not learnt the lesson that educational investment is as much an investment in the nation's good as is capital investment in building or industrial development. They must learn that lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point about issuing examination results is that in many parents' minds that will become the only criterion upon which they will judge a school. They will ask "What are the examination results?" If they are good, or appear to be good on the surface, they will say "That is where we would like our child to go."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what education is about. It is one of the worst aspects of our education system that it has become almost entirely geared to examinations that are still taken by comparatively few of our children. The third and fourth years, at least, of secondary school are geared to providing courses for those who are to sit examinations, and the other children tend to be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is already happening. That is already one of the bugbears of the education system in Scotland—and in England and Wales. The examination results are what the whole school works towards. That attitude would be strengthened if examinations became the major criterion on which parents made their parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other things that ought to be done. My hon Friend mentioned Munn and Dunning. The Dunning report was about the new examination system. Many of us objected strongly to that system of examination, because not enough emphasis was placed on internal school assessment of pupils as opposed to external assessment. In our view, certainly for the children who are not so academically bright, internal assessment of total performance in school is a better way of forming a judgment than an external examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is how schools treat children as a whole that is important—what the school provides in terms of the child's ability to learn and of developing the individual to the fullest extent. In a school where the examination result is all-important, the children who are to sit the examinations will be given the preference and the rest, who do not sit examinations, will be largely forgotten. To some extent that already happens. I think that this provision would make the situation even worse, and that would be very harmful to our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examinations should not be all-important in schools. If they are, then about 70 per cent, of the children in secondary schools—those who do not sit examinations—are not being taken into account, and that is wrong. The education system is paid for by everybody, and it should be for the benefit of every child. This provision would encourage schools to emphasise the interests of only the 30 or 40 per cent, who will sit the examinations. 1 shall therefore vote for the amendment with my hon Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
I do not understand how Opposition hon Members think that parents can make a reasonable choice if they are ignorant of what the school is providing and of the achievements of the school. If examinations are wholly left out of consideration of the performance of the school, that will not make the assessment of the school's performance more balanced; it will have the opposite effect. To learn only about what happened in school sports, the chess club or the music society will be of no great value to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the football team, if that is of concern to the hon Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that Opposition hon Members cannot see this point. It has already been my experience that a certain school can have a very good record of achievement across the board—not only in academic performance but in chess clubs, music societies and school sports—but once a rumour or gossip gets about the local community that that school is not performing well, the parents, given the right to choose that they already have, start to move their children. Far 'from simply provoking the whimsical movement of children from one school to another, the provision of information on academic standards would ensure that the fears of some parents were allayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon Members have referred to figures to show that the vast majority of parents in Scotland are satisfied with their children's education. Far from being diminished, that sense of satisfaction would, in large measure, be (reinforced if parents were aware exactly what academic opportunities were open to their Children and aware that other children who had been exposed to the same opportunities had been able to take advantage of them and had demonstrated that advantage by their successful exam results.

If the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) wants to advance a vast philosophical change in education—that there should be no standards, no examinations and mo requirements for entry into universities—I can understand what he is getting at. But so long as examinations are to be part of our education system and part of the requirement of entry into institutes of higher education, it seems to me entirely appropriate that parents should know what each and every school does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) for his remarks and particularly for his comment that rumour and gossip cause whimsical movement of children between schools. Very often, ill-informed gossip gives a school a reputation—either a good or a bad reputation—which that school has not earned by the provision of education and the general behaviour of its staff and pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is a fundamental reason why we should ensure that fears are allayed and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
ignorance about schools is removed, as far as humanly possible. The whole drive behind the Bill is to ensure that parents receive the maximum, amount of useful and helpful information so that they may choose a school in an informed way. One cannot exclude examination results, as my hon Friend said, but I shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend emphasised that the prime purpose of the Bill, and of this part of it, was to provide information to parents. There are local authorities and schools in Scotland which go a long way towards providing information, but that is by no means universal and the quality of information is, in many pants of the country, not at all satisfactory for the purpose that the Government have in mind. Therefore, the party of less government, which does not wish to put more legislation on the statute hook, should understand that legislation on the rights of individual members of the public—in this case, parents—is unsatisfactory, and the purpose of the Bill is to correct that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has considerable experience of the education system, not only in Scotland, but in England, where I believe that he was educated. He has experience not only in the public sector, but in the private sector, which is I am sure very useful to the Committee because that teaching experience was gained in a very distinguished private school in Glasgow—the Glasgow academy. Therefore his consideration of the Bill is very helpful. The hon Gentleman speaks at times more as an adviser to the Committee than a participant. I make no complaint about that, 'but I am sure that he would wish to show his objectivity occasionally by voting with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman referred to the Munn and Dunning proposals. Rather, he did not so much refer to them as criticise and ridicule the fact that the examination system in Scotland ruled out about 70 per cent, of the school population. I agree entirely with the sentiments behind those remarks and the deplorable situation when Ograde examinations cater for only about 30 per cent, of the school population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon Gentleman will know that the Munn and Dunning proposals that are being introduced are meant precisely to make up the lost ground. They were sought by the previous Labour Government and then allowed to lie on the shelves of St. Andrew's House and gather dust for two or three years until we came into office and were able to take steps to implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Munn and Dunning proposals are no part of the Bill. I mention them simply to emphasise that the Bill's procedures for publishing examination results will have a much more extensive interest. It is not only the 30 per cent, sitting O-grade examinations who will be interested in the examination results but 80 per cent, or 90 per cent.-plus of the school population—once the Munn and Dunning proposals take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not agree with the Munn and Dunning proposals and the suggestion of a new examination system. What was called the foundation
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
level would have been a certificate for failure, rather than a genuine assessment. But I really want to take issue with the Minister on one point. He said that under the Labour Government the proposals lay for two or three years gathering dust. We asked for comments after the report was published and they were received from a variety of organisations. I was on four committees which commented on it. The Labour Government then set up pilot schemes. The Minister has carried on those schemes and is now perhaps in the process of expanding them. But he should not say that the proposals gathered dust in St. Andrew's House, because that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous Government had no commitment to the proposals. As I have already indicated, one feature of the hon Member for Cath-cart's contributions to the Committee is that he seems to be generally in favour of change and progress in education, but he can never make up his mind whether he supports any particular innovation or form of change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are very important amendments, because they strike at the heart of the Bill. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) expressed very frank views, first about who is served by schools in Scotland. He asked whether it was children, parents, teachers or the community. I believe that he thought that at least in some parts of the country it was felt that the education system—like so many State organisations—existed to satisfy teachers rather than consumers. I am glad that he takes such a frank view. I believe that there is a danger that all Government-sponsored organisations are liable to find themselves in that situation. We should remind ourselves that the purpose of the education system is to satisfy the needs of children and to assist parents in their duties of ensuring that their children are properly educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I appreciate that the Minister may have been confused by what I said this morning. I was endeavouring to point out that it was no longer the case that schools existed for the benefit of teachers. There is now a commonly agreed commitment on the part of authorities and the teaching profession that schools exist for children, parents and the community at large. Because of the sea change in opinion, it is no longer necessary to legislate along the lines that the Minister has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that it is necessary to lay down the rights of parents and duties of local authorities because we are equally anxious to be helpful to those who have responsibility for administering education in Scotland and to the teachers, who have an indispensable role in the education system. That is why we wish to pursue the Bill's proposal, and so I am unable to accept any of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is refreshing to hear the hon Gentleman telling the Committee about the importance of children and parents in the Scottish education system. So often we hear from Labour Benches in the House
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
a constant defence of the bureaucracy of the State machine at central government and local level. That constant attitude disregards completely the importance of the consumer in many aspects of our life, not least in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the consumer is important, but he is not all-important. The education system is paid for by taxpayers in order to ensure the economic and social well-being of our country as well as just providing for the individual ambitions of children and parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Gentleman is not suggesting that education is free, because people who use the system also pay for it. There is no distinction between who pays for State education and who receives it. I am sure that the hon Gentleman would not wish to ignore that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire that school prospectuses are useful. There are many of them around in Scotland, and they are often full of helpful information. But I disagree with the hon Member about publication of the examination results. It is all very well a prospectus telling us about the school play, outings and .the football team, but it would 'be a pretty useless document if, when parents were trying to find out more about the school to which they wish to send their children, there was no record of the school's academic performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman cite any educational authority which takes the view that examination results of particular schools should be published in, for instance, the local newspaper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very emotive argument behind the publication of school examination results, an emotion which has certainly not been aroused by the Conservative Party, but it has been aroused by Labour Members who see a cheap newspaper headline. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire mentioned league tables several times. He suggested that we would want to publish the crude examination results in order of .performance by schools in a district and print them in the local newspaper. That accusation is completely unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We published a consultative paper on information to parents which was available to the Committee on Tuesday. The document explains how results could be presented to parents so that they could make a choice. The Opposition cannot argue that more information should be made available, that more parental choice should be given, and the consumer should have his say, and then qualify that drastically by saying that we should not tell parents anything about examination results. Do hon Gentlemen suggest that a parent who decides to send his child to a particular school should not be told what must be among the most important matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Cathcart shakes his head. Is he trying to suggest that if he is selecting a school for his children he is uninterested in the academic
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
performance of that school? Does he subscribe to the Socialist theory that all schools are equal and one school is as good as another academically, and therefore that it does not matter where one sends one's children? The hon Member is still shaking his head simultaneously in both directions and I cannot decide on which side he wants to come down, but I take it that the fact that he is still sitting there suggests that he, like me, refutes the argument that all schools are equal, and that it does not matter to which school one sends one's children. I take that he also refutes the argument—although he will not say so—that the academic performance of schools is of vital importance to parents in deciding on schools for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) was extremely helpful to the Committee this morning. He took the view that examination results were important for parents and that .parents wished to have some knowledge of the academic performance of schools. He also said that it was not just the examination results themselves but that they gave an indication of the range of subjects in schools—I believe those were his words—and the seriousness with which the schools taught these subjects. Most schools will .promise to teach everything, but clearly—and I make no complaint about this—some schools take some subjects more seriously than other subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all for such specialisation in urban areas, where there is a choice of schools and where parents might find it suitable and helpful to know that there were particular academic strengths in one school compared with another. Similarly, parents may decide to send their children to school A rather than to school B, for the important reason that school A may have stiff discipline and school B may be more progressive, and the reverse is equally true. There are many reasons for parents' choice of schools for their children, as the hon Member for Dundee East recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member also mentioned Munn and Dunning. I agree that it is important to include in the presentation of exam results the effect of the Munn and Dunning proposals, because they could blur the scene for some years until we are used to them "and get some comparisons, and until they come into effect more generally. I am grateful to him for making that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said that we were all interested in backing winners, but he had not thought that glib remark out properly. He should remember that the Government are introducing the Munn and Dunning proposals with great conviction and that he, like his hon Friend the Member for Cathcart, seemed still to have some doubts as to whether the Munn and Dunning proposals were the right road to follow. We cannot stand around and debate any longer about Munn and Dunning, because, as the hon Member for Cathcart rightly advised the Committee, 70 per cent, of children in schools do not have an examination system which is appropriate to them. We cannot deliberate on the advisory irole for ever.

We must make decisions and do something about it, which is precisely what the Government are doing about the examination system in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reflect that while we are discussing an education system, the Munn and Dunning system is being introduced by administrative fiat, and the one thing that the Scottish Grand Committee has not had a chance to debate fully is the Munn and Dunning system? The Minister must take into account that that important decision has been removed from the parliamentary process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not been removed from the parliamentary process. It does not require legislation, and we should rejoice in that, but there has been a great deal of consultation on Munn and Dunning in Scotland, and there is no one in education and no one in politics who has not had the opportunity to make his views known. I do not happen to know the views of the Scottish National Party on Munn and Dunning. If they have 'been sent to the Scottish Office I agree with the hon Gentleman that I should know. But, equally, he will agree with me that if it has not sent in its views on Munn and Dunning, it is unlikely that I would know its views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the hon Gentleman's remarks suggest that it is better to make wrong decisions than to make no decisions. I find that remarkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to make decisions. That is the first requirement of anyone who is in office. But it is impossible to wait until there is certainty that a decision is 100 per cent, correct. Although that is clearly the hon Gentleman's desire, he will remain an adviser if he tries to do that. He should sharpen up his objectivity, because plainly his decision-making is beyond repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad of the support of the hon Member for Dundee, East. Schools are intended first and foremost for those who use them. That is what the Bill is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman mentioned in passing the impact of falling school rolls on secondary schools, particularly on the 16, 17 and 18-year age group. But I do not want to go into that matter now, except to say that as schools empty at the top level and educational viability becomes more difficult, the syllabus and the school's performance become more important to parents in respect of parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that I do not dispute that the Labour Party has and has had objectives relating to parental choice. But its record in parts of Scotland has been deplorable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the record of Lothian region, which is not far from Fife, is deplorable, and there are other parts of Scotland where more information could be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
I agree that Fife, about which the hon Member spoke, has been adventurous, that it has experimented and that it has done much to try to promote parental choice. But the reason why his figures on take-up are low is that Fife has been concerned about the initial transfer from primary to secondary schools. We must cope with transfers during the time when a child undergoes primary or secondary education because there may be reasons why a parent would request a transfer under those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I must defend the working class. It is absurd that in this day and age a Labour Member should say "Let us not allow choice because only middle-and upper-class people can read and write properly and understand what we are trying to do." It was suggested that if we let this matter loose on the working class, who are too illiterate or too ignorant to be able to make such choices, it could not benefit them. That is an insult to most voters, a grave insult that my colleagues in Committee totally reject. Class warfare is from the Dark Ages and from hon Members opposite. But we want to provide equal opportunity for all, and we have sufficient faith and confidence in the Scottish education system to know that over 	<i>99</i> per cent, of the people in Scotland can read and write well, and make good decisions. This Bill will enable them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the hon Gentleman said during the general election campaign, when the Tories had big posters all over Scotland which had "education" spelt with a "k" and an "sh" and "working" spelt with a "u" instead of an "o" That was cheap Tory propaganda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon Gentleman was able to read the posters. That is why we wrote them in that way—so that the hon Gentleman could understand what we were trying to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it abundantly clear that we utterly reject the restriction that Labour Members wish to place on the information that should be available to parents. It is fundamental to the Bill that, when making a choice, the people of Scotland should be well informed. Therefore, I urge my hon Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been treated to a defence of the working class by the Minister who is most responsible for the disappearance of the working class in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair enjoys the robustness of the debate, but the noise makes it difficult for 	<i>Hansard</i> to pick up what the hon Member is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
cussions on the clause what has resembled a clause stand part debate on the principle. We will certainly want to consider the question of the examination results again in some detail on amendment No. 48.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make it clear that the narrow range of information that will be provided to define the academic performance of schools, on which the Minister places so much emphasis, will not be satisfactory and will in many ways not be helpful to parents seeking to exercise some degree of choice. No matter how enthusiastic the Minister is about Munn and Dunning, I imagine that local authorities will still be entitled to decide whether or not they wish to take advantage of those proposals. In the early stages youngsters will have an opportunity to sit O-grade examinations as they do now. There will be a period of overlap, which will be extremely confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities may well devolve the responsibility for decisions about the implementation or acceptance of Munn and Dunning to individual headmasters. Some local authorities may take no view on the matter but leave it to the discretion of the headmasters. In such cases there will not be within a local authority area the uniformity of information that the Minister would want and which would provide the basis for what he would regard as reasonable comparison between schools. The Minister's own words therefore undermine what he seeks to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said it time and again. I make no apology for using the expression "league table". The Minister is being naive if he thinks that local newspapers will not publish the information that is made available to parents. I recognise that the research facilities of some local newspapers are restricted, but, given the narrowness of the range of the information that the Minister wants to be included in the prospectuses, local newspapers will find it easy to construct a league table. If the Minister chooses to ignore that point, he is ignoring a major area of criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not making a cheap point. We recognise that this will become a feature of local journalism. There will be an annual education report providing comment and correspondence. If local papers can fill up the space between the advertisements with letters, the journalists are saved a lot of work. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That tactic is certainly used in the local newspapers that I read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the synthetic controversy created over local government rating in East Central Scotland was made possible by the opportunities afforded by the Edinburgh 	<i>Evening News</i> to fill up its columns with crackpot letters. I imagine that pages would be made available for educational debate and that league tables would lie at the heart of the coverage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criteria laid down by the Minister are far too narrow. We would like to return to the matter on amendment No. 48, and we feel that the strength of our arguments in this area could well win the day on that amendment. We hope, too, that we will be able to vote on amendment No. 46, which would give local authorities the right to decide what to

We are concerned that the cost of the parents' charter should not be borne by local authorities at this time without any adequate recompense in the form of an increase in the rate support grant. This is a time of massive cutbacks in expenditure on education—cutbacks that seem to take no account of the concept of diseconomies of scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea is that simply because there are fewer pupils in the classrooms one can cut the money and allow a wee drop more per head and that in that way the education system will be adequately funded. That is a very dangerous view, which will certainly result in the further impoverishment of Scottish education. We do not consider that it would be appropriate at this stage, therefore, to place further burdens on the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
The public expenditure White Paper that accompanied the announcement of the Budget last week spelt out clearly the extent to which local authorities would have to cut back in education. I believe that the figure quoted was £53 million. That cutback will result in restrictions in teacher-pupil ratios.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the present climate, we would consider the additional burden of financing the publication of prospectuses and the collation of information, by a statutory obligation, to be most unfortunate. We should be happy to seek to withdraw the amendment if the Minister were prepared to say that the Government would provide extra funds for education, not least to finance the publication of prospectuses. As I said earlier, we may be able to amend the prospectuses to a form that we would find acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suspect that the Minister does not know how much this would cost in any one year. We are told that a figure of £100,000 was quoted. We consider that to be grossly inadequate. We should take into account the time that will be spent by assistant head teachers in secondary schools in putting the prospectus together and making sure that each department has submitted its report. That expenditure of time and effort will be unreasonable for people who already have to do far more work simply because of the cut in Government and local government funding. The figure of £100,000 is unrealistically low. We therefore view the matter with great concern. If the Minister were prepared to increase that figure, we should be happy to go along with him. If he were to increase it to about £500,000 we might consider that to be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate what the Minister will say, but, on past records of parsimony, I cannot imagine his being any more generous. Therefore, we shall have to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that the figure mentioned on page v of the Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum is for information. It is not debatable. A motion to increase expenditure can be made only by a Minister of the Crown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Gourlay, but the Government are under an obligation to give an estimate of what their proposals will cost. We are very conscious of the Government's clobbering of local authorities in regard to their expenditure. In that context, we are seeking to ascertain the Government's estimate of this part of the Bill's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the draft regulations, there seems little doubt that local authorities will have to employ considerable numbers of additional staff. I do not know whether the Government have consulted local authorities for their estimate of those additional staff. Certainly the Government do not know. On page vi of the explanatory and financial memorandum we read that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"provisions may involve a small but unquantifiable increase in the pressures on regional and islands council staff."</p></blockquote>
If it is unquantifiable, how do the Government know that it is small? Local authorities must have some idea how many additional staff they would require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
As to the financial cost, we all know how unrealistic the figures are likely to be. We have had some indication in the last year of the wrongness of the Government's decisions, from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has been wildly out in his estimates of every part of public expenditure. If the Chancellor, who is one of the intellectual elite of the Government, has got it wrong, how much credence can we place in the estimates of the hon Gentleman in charge of this Bill? The estimates are wildly out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, I would ask the hon Gentleman about the effects of inflation on the financial costs of the provisions. Inflation, far from being brought under control very shortly, will, no doubt, increase. The Budget will cause an increase of at least 2 per cent., if not 4 per cent, in inflation. The additional 20p on petrol has to flow through the price that the consumer pays for every item. Transport costs will escalate as a result of that, particularly in the rural areas represented by Conservative Members. They do not represent them in the voting Lobby, because some of them did not even bother to vote on that 20p increase. The built-in inflationary pressures in the Government's policies are bound to be reflected in the costs of implementing the Bill's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we want to stress that those costs should not be covered by the ratepayers. They are already being hard pressed by the Government's policies and ought not to be subject to further imposts as a consequence of this Bill's provisions. I hope that the Minister will give us some up-to-date figures which will take into account the likelihood of increased inflation over the years mentioned in the financial and explanatory memorandum, because I suspect that those figures are as grossly underestimated as the Chancellor of the Exchequer's estimate of the public sector borrowing requirement. I think that that is a reasonable point and hope that the Minister will give us a reasonable answer and give us some idea of the additional costs and staff that the local authorities will face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we cannot debate the sums of money and certainly cannot amend them. However, the Government's estimate is £100,000. I think that there are 11 regional education authorities in Scotland. Presumably every local authority will have to employ someone to put out the necessary information or to ensure that the schools put out that information. Moreover, presumably that post will be at a reasonably high administrative level commanding a salary of £10,000 to £11,000—although, these days, that is a low sum for a local government salary. I do not think that every local authority in Scotland will be able to afford to employ an extra member of staff to carry out the task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Maybe they will employ, voluntarily, the unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. Perhaps they will use the youth opportunities programme to get the work done. I do not know. However, the figure given is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
unrealistic. The provision also hits hard at those education authorities which are finding it difficult to meet even their statutory obligations because of the expenditure cuts imposed on them, and which are then obliged to spend extra money—even if that is supplied by the Government—to carry out this fringe activity. If the Government are prepared to give £100,000, we would prefer that it should be spent on books and equipment, so that teachers can do their jobs properly. I am sure that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) would agree if he were here.

In Strathclyde at present the per capita expenditure on school pupils is likely to be decreased in the coming year by about 25 per cent, compared with last year. That is in money terms—not real terms; with inflation on top, the decrease would be about 30 per cent, to 40 per cent. As one primary headmistress in my constituency told me, that means that there will be 4p per day per pupil—less than most children spend on a packet of crisps per day—to buy books.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would Opposition Members not agree that if local authorities were to reduce the vast number of administrators in education departments a great deal more money would be available for use in school classes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if I accepted that argument, we are debating a clause which will increase the vast bureaucracy in education of which the hon Gentleman complains. Our amendment is designed to ensure that local authorities do not increase their bureaucracies. When we vote on the amendment, I hope that the hon Gentleman will vote with us, because he does not believe in a large bureaucracy and therefore should not vote for an increase in it, which is what would occur if the clause were accepted without our amendment. Local authorities would be forced to take on, not extra teachers, not people working in the classrooms with the children, but more administrators, both at the school level, where some teachers who should be in the classrooms—assistant heads and deputy heads—will have to spend valuable time drawing up prospectuses rather than teaching children, and the local authority level, where extra staff will have to be taken on to do the work entailed by the clause. I should be grateful if the hon Gentleman were to vote with the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are financially very hard pressed. I do not believe that most local authorities have a massive bureaucracy in education, but—as is inevitable in any organisation—they must have people to administer it. That is true of any private company. Government Members never mention the increase in what one would term middle management in the private sector over the past 20 or 30 years. I should have thought that the proportionate increase would be the same as has taken place in public bodies. The more complex our society becomes, the greater the need for administrators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are being forced to make cuts in their education expenditure which will have long-term damaging effects on those being educated and
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
upon whole communities and societies. It is nonsense, therefore, for the Government to suggest spending even that small sum on such an activity. As my hon Friends have said, we do not believe that it can be done for that sum. We believe that it will cost local authorities considerably more, which means that other matters more essential to education will be cut as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is more misunderstanding than meanness about the Opposition's amendment. There is no meanness on the Government's part in paying for the information which we believe to be necessary, and therefore the funding in the Bill—at prices ruling at the time—will be, first, updated for inflation, and, secondly, part of the rate support grant provision. Therefore, the Government are providing the bulk of the means to publish the information that parents require under the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the confusion comes into the minds of Opposition Members is that they seem to think that we have to delve through the records of the education authorities and the schools to find the information in the first place. That is clearly not so. We are talking about information that already exists. I hope that it exists. I hope that our education authorities and schools know the examination results and are aware of the cultural and social activities in schools. There is plenty of evidence that they do, because of the number of prospectuses that are published by schools and the amount of helpful information currently available from a number of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is clear that we are providing for additional funding. It is a marginal increase in funds for what is purely a matter of taking information already available and adding that to the information provided in those authorities that do not publish the requirements that we consider necessary under the Bill. It is a marginal increase in expense to publish the information. There should be no, or very little, new expense in obtaining or providing the information, because it should be there. I am sorry that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is puzzled by what I have said, but it is a fact of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central 	<i>(Mr.</i> Hamilton) was concerned about the view of the local authorities. This issue has never been raised in the several meetings that I have had with COSLA. It knows that it is our intention to make a contribution on rate support grant for these purposes. Therefore, it seems legitimate to assume that it has no quarrel with the estimate in the memorandum, for the simple reason that, in assessing the figure that was necessary, we looked at the current cost of providing information. It seemed to us that the increase met the any extra requirements that might be placed on the local authorities as a result of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can explain something to me, because I am having difficulty in understanding the paragraph on the financial effects of the Bill, and he does not seem to have covered this in his remarks so far. One imagines that when the scheme is introduced, the withdrawal of the information will be a fairly expensive operation. I know that the word
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
"expensive" is like the question "How long is a piece of string?", but it will cost more the first year than in subsequent years. But it seems that the Minister is suggesting that it will cost less in the first year, for something which is taking place at present but for which the information will have to be extracted, and more in subsequent years. Is that because of inflation or because there is a mushroom effect in the expenditure? The Minister ought to try to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happily do so. It is for neither of the reasons that the hon Gentleman suggested. It is simply that the first year is only a partial year. We are talking about the proposals coming into effect during 1981-82, so we shall not have a full year's cost. The figure that we should be discussing is the additional cost in a full year for topping up the information already provided—and we must remember that information is already available to the authorities. We estimate that, at present prices, the additional cost in a full year will be £300,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister now telling us that the parental charter which has been trumpeted about Scotland will not be available in 1981-82? If that is so, why are we meeting twice a day to try to get this daft Bill through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I do not know whether the hon Gentleman is being a bit stupid or whether he is deliberately trying to make more noise. It is obvious from the progress that we have made and
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
from today's date that we shall be able to implement the Bill only in the course of 1981-82. With that in mind, the financial estimates of the cost of the extra provision of information in 1981-82 are considerably lower than those for a full year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
