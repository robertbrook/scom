O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, Mr. Hunt, to welcome you to the Committee this morning. As you may appreciate, Scottish Standing Committees are somewhat more intimate than others—even in this large Committee Room—partly because Scottish Members are in fairly constant contact with our colleagues from north of the border. If the meaning of a joke or a remark may on occasion escape you, I am sure that a note can be passed to you to explain the hidden meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I believe that our sitting this morning may well be a historic one. We realise that there is a spirit of rebellion on the Tory Back Benches today. We believe that our amendment may catch the mood of the Tory Back Benchers, because it is our opinion that the Minister is seeking in some respects, through amendment No. 7, further to restrict freedom of parental choice, and that this may well arouse opposition among his Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be the prospect of a meeting this morning between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and senior Scottish Back Benchers about the Budget. I appreciate that we are not discussing the Budget. Nevertheless, what we are discussing is a contentious issue, and it may well be that rebellion on the Conservative Benches will break out in the form of a rash—as it sometimes does in the Labour Party—rather than take the normal discreet Conservative form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment in some respects brings us to the heart of our opposition to the Bill as regards the placing of pupils, because one of the consequences of the placing of pupils is the problem that some schools have in sustaining courses, as a result of the movement of pupils from what some parents
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
would consider to be less desirable schools. The consequence can be felt in two ways. First, staffing ratios in the schools that are thought to be less desirable will cease to be supportable by the numbers in the schools. Consequently, local authorities will be required, if they are to provide for the children in the other establishments, to transfer staff from the so-called less desirable schools to the more desirable schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 seeks to clarify the position in terms of the types of teachers. We wanted to make the point that it would be not only class teachers who were affected by the Bill but those specialist teachers who are in some instances peripatetic, and who are in very short supply. If the result of a more liberal system of parental choice was to undermine the staffing position in existing schools, that would undermine the quality of education provided for those children whose parents hitherto had been satisfied with their education. Consequently we are trying, through our amendment, to have the position clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill affords more parental choice—and at the moment there is some doubt about whether it will do so—the Government could well endanger the educational provision for the majority of children, those whose parents have hitherto been content to send their youngsters to local schools. If parents in great numbers exercise parental choice in such a way as to denude some institutions of large numbers of pupils, we could reach a situation in urban areas in which only certain desirable secondary schools will continue to provide a wide range of courses— especially past the S4. Therefore, children wishing to pursue higher grade Scottish certificate of education courses might have a limited range of course options. The Opposition consider this to be a bad prospect which could bring us back to the bad old days of junior secondary school and senior secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether it is the express intention of the Government to undermine the comprehensive system remains to be seen. From the expenditure White Paper that accompanied the Chancellor's Budget Statement it is clear that the Government have no strong commitment to maintaining both educational standards and pupil-teacher ratios at the levels reached in the present year. It is clear that it will be many years before the pupil-teacher ratios return to anything like the levels enjoyed in Scotland since the mid-1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at a loss to know the Government's intentions concerning their commitment to the comprehensive ideal and the quality of education. This is not a purely partisan view. The General Teaching Council for Scotland expressed great concern about the effects of the cutbacks both in provision for education and on the quality of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives rise to grave concern about the future of Scottish education as we have known it during the past 10 years, since the firming up of the comprehensive system. Unlike that in other parts of the United Kingdom, the traditional system of education in Scotland has been comprehensive in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
sense that the majority of children have gone to the local school, not on the basis of class or ability, but because it was the school nearest to their home, so in the main the schools have reflected the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time we had systems of junior and senior secondary education in the urban areas, which meant that some children received inferior education because they were less able, and other children had a better chance because they were able to pass what used to be called the qualifying examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to say that the Bill will bring us back to the bad old days when authorities like Edinburgh town council, the precursor of the progressive liberal Lothian region, provided education which has now frightened the Government into introducing legislation to curb that authority's expenditure on such worthwhile projects as education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that if parents are allowed unrestricted choice, or even choice restricted by the Bill, the exercise of that choice will have implications on staffing. We are concerned, first, that the staffing implications shall be quantified in financial terms, in the sense of its not resulting in local authorities having to take on more class or specialist teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are concerned that local authorities will not choose, or see fit, to start moving staff around within an authority because if they do so there will be a condoning of mass movements of pupils from one part of a city to another. I say " city " because in most instances the effect will be felt most severely in urban areas. In other parts of Scotland the local school will be the only realistic option that the parents will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In urban areas where the parents could take advantage of the charter there are implications for those schools which are deemed by the parents to be less desirable. The reasons why parents will deem particular institutions to be less desirable may be many and varied. On Second Reading I quoted at some length from the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association's document which explained clearly the range of reasons why parents decide to change their child's school. It can be because of an alleged scandal in a particular school. On occasions the scandal may have no substance but it will be headlined in the local papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school may have a sporting success, which may be a fluke because one generation of pupils happens to be good at a particular sport. If in one set of open examinations the children do extremely well, an impression is given that all the children receive a particular form of academic education which will be available to everybody who attends that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason could be that in certain papers or journals a head teacher is praised for what could be called the progressive education ideals that the school seeks to implement. In some instances that may result in parents thinking that they do not want progressive education. Invariably journalists are responsible for an impression given about a school,
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
but the quality of that journalism is, to say the least, suspect. While some education correspondents, especially in Scotland, have a high standard, there are others who endeavour to present the education system in the least favourable light. Certainly those people who are unfortunate enough to have to depend on 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> for their information have over the years been subjected to a sustained and largely unsupported attack on the comprehensive ideal. I know that at a later stage we shall discuss what the Government may see fit to consider as a means of providing information. I do not wish to stray on to such matters as league tables and examination results, because those matters are not our consideration at present. I am merely trying to suggest that there are a variety of reasons why parents would wish to have their children moved from one school to another. However, in many instances, these reasons are not based on fact, or on any serious consideration: sometimes they are based on snobbish caprice. But in a free society I recognise that that is a consideration which parents are allowed to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should bear in mind, more than anything else, that the vast majority of children in Scottish schools are there because their parents are content with the education that their children receive. We have a responsibility to the children and to the parents who at present do not object to the education provided by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish the population in certain schools, especially those in urban areas, to be drained and some of their more able teachers taken away to schools which the parents perceive to be more desirable. We want to make sure that in this part of the Bill it is clear that there will be not only financial considerations, and that local authorities will not be forced to take on additional teachers, either of a class teacher nature or of a peripatetic nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very important in the primary sector. In many instances, specialist teachers, who are often in short supply, have to travel between several schools. The number of such teachers may have to be increased at a time when education authorities are in grave financial difficulty. We should consider it most unfortunate if extra teachers had to be taken on at the expense of other aspects of education. We are not opposed to the employment of those teachers. We should welcome it. But we do not see the need for more teachers to be employed as an extension of parental choice. There are far more compelling reasons for the expansion of the staffing side of education and for improving staff-pupil ratios. It would appear from the public expenditure White Paper issued at the same time as the Budget Statement that pupil-teacher ratios in Scotland will deteriorate over the next three or four years, with no prospect of their returning to their present state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to press amendment No. 8. We realise that in some respects amendment No. 7 will probably further undermine aspects of parental choice and we wonder whether the Minister will have the support of all members of his party on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
We do not wish local authorities to be forced to switch teachers between schools and to change the pattern of education, resulting in the reappearance of junior and secondary schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall await the Minister's views on the points on which we seek clarification. We shall see what other members of the Committee have to say, and then we shall vote accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, from the Back Benches, welcome you, Mr. Hunt, to the Chair. I think that you are a man of remarkable courage. Any Englishman taking on the role of Chairman of a Committee dealing with Scottish matters is taking on an onerous task, but to take on a Committee dealing with education in Scotland, which is very different from that in England and Wales, shows true courage. I welcome you to the Committee, but I do not envy you your task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have served on three of the four major Scottish Committees in this Parliament may lapse into calling you Mr. Gourlay, because we are so accustomed to seeing him in the Chair, but I hope that you will not take offence at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment, tabled very much at the instigation of the Scottish Consumer Council, goes to the heart of what we believe to be wrong with the concept of freedom; of choice. In a modern, industrial democratic society, the freedom and rights of individuals must always be determined by how they will influence the freedom and rights of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause originally said that a local authority could refuse to place a child if it meant employing an extra teacher in a school. It could be argued that only that school would be influenced when the local authority was making its decision about whether it would allow the entry of a particular applicant. However, if that were amended so that the local authority could refuse entry only if it necessitated engaging an extra teacher in the education authority area, that would affect not just the school which would take the pupil but all the schools in that area. Therefore, I shall oppose the amendment, because it could seriously affect the work of other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) rightly said that sometimes choices about whether a school was popular or unpopular were made on very subjective grounds. But, for whatever reasons a choice is made, when a pupil moves from one school to another it may affect—if the amendment is passed— the school that the pupil leaves. That could affect not merely the education of one or two children whose parents were taking advantage of the new legislation, but the education of all those who were left—those whose parents might not take much interest in education and who might not be aware of the provisions of the Bill. As a result the education of those children could be affected. That hits at the very heart of individual freedom, because it means that the rights of some children who should be free to have suitable education would be seriously affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
It is necessary, with your forbearance, Mr. Hunt, to give some fairly concrete examples from my own constituency of what could happen. There are three major secondary schools there. King's Park secondary school is in a middle-class area. It is largely a middle class school and it has a good academic reputation. That is to be expected from a school that draws its children from families who see the need for their children to receive a good education and who want their children to do well. That school also has a good record in respect of drama, debating societies and all those activities which a middle-class school is expected to do well in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Less than a mile and a half away there are two other schools: the Glenwood secondary school and the Grange secondary school. Both serve the Castle-milk area, which is a large public housing scheme in one of the poorer parts of Glasgow. Twenty five per cent, of the parents who live there are now unemployed and, of those who are employed, many are employed in unskilled work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a small percentage are semi-skilled, or artisan. An even smaller proportion, if any, have been through the full course of academic training—either teacher training or a university degree course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the lower end of the Castlemilk housing scheme some pupils live nearer to King's Park secondary school than to the schools which they attend. A few parents would prefer to see their children at King's Park secondary school, for a variety of reasons. Two non-denominational secondary schools, the Grange and Glenwood school, have already experienced difficulties is sustaining higher level courses—which are the near equivalent of A-levels in England. There are not large numbers of pupils who want to do highers, but at the moment there are just sufficient students of the major subjects to sustain higher courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fewer pupils may decide to study for higher level courses because of declining school rolls and a few parents—it would take only a few—may decide that they want their children to go to the other secondary school to study, say, physics or maths. It is still difficult to find teachers of those subjects, although I accept that some teachers become Members of Parliament. In that case King's Park School would probably have to provide for extra classes, probably at both O-level and higher level, for only three or four pupils. The Grange and Glenwood school would no longer have sufficient numbers to sustain a physics or a maths course and as a result the, say, 9 or 10 pupils who would be left wishing to study physics and maths at higher level or even at O-level, would not have a teacher, because he would have to be transferred to King's Park school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many pupils from that housing scheme would not move to King's Park secondary school in order to do those classes, even if they were given that option, because they believe that the pupils of King's Park secondary school are different from them. They do not want to go there and would prefer to stay where they are. However, they could find that their educational opportunities are seriously handicapped as a result of the movement of a few pupils and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
one teacher from one school to another. That could be the result of the amendment—which is what we find most damaging about it—and, to some extent, the whole freedom-of-choice legislation that the Government are putting through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a matter of those few pupils losing an opportunity, because some of them would be forced to go to King's Park or to another school, or perhaps to a college of further education, to obtain the courses that they want. It would mean that practically all the brighter pupils, who provide the educational incentive for the rest of the school, would disappear from the school at 16, if not earlier. At the top of the school in particular, there would remain only these who are not going to sit examinations, those who are not very bright academically, or those whose parents have no incentive or drive for education and do not particularly wish to see their children obtain a better education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must affect the whole morale of the school, who do pupils look to when they come in to that school at 11 or 12-plus? They are young children from primary schools coming into a totally new environment, and of course they look to pupils in the top classes. If in those top classes there are few pupils seeking educational qualifications, that becomes the guide for pupils lower down the school. They would think that academic attainment and the ability to pass examinations were not important for them. Pupils do not look a teachers, or even necessarily to their parents, for incentives. Young children look to their peer group and those just a few years older than themselves. So the incentive and initiative would be removed from that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the impact of that upon the teachers in that school? Anyone who has taught knows that to teach brighter pupils is the cream on the cake or the jam on the bread of teaching. Most good teachers will want to teach across the range of academic ability, but they will want to know that their own efforts, education and university degree can be used to take a few pupils further than they would otherwise have gone. Therefore, in a school which has lost its academic stream to other areas the teachers will become demoralised. They will seek transfers—even if they are not being transferred by the local authorities—to oher schools where they can use their academic abilities to the fullest extent. There would be demoralised staffs in demoralised schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those schools—particularly the two that I am talking about, and those in other parts of the city of Glasgow and other urban areas of Scotland—are not just education establishments. They are part and parcel of the community. They service the community in other ways than just the provision of education. In the Castlemilk area there are no banks, pubs, cinemas or bingo halls. There are very few youth clubs and there is only one cafe. Therefore, the schools provide an essential service to the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
If we demoralise first the school and then the staff, and eventually, because of declining pupil numbers, those schools are closed, we are destroying and taking away not only the schools, but the community centre itself. In a community that is already suffering massive deprivation as a result of what the previous Labour Government did and more so as a result of what this Government are doing, the people will find—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who built it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—that they have little hope left. Pupils who do not move to other schools outside will have no hope, although they have little enough hope at present, of obtaining employment. They may have to move to schools in which they find the environment totally foreign to their own backgrounds, and the result will be a demoralisation of whole areas of our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have accepted the clause as it stood and agreed that if a school had to engage one extra teacher, that would be its responsibility. But this amendment will mean that teachers will move around the area, and I cannot accept the impact that that could have on some of the pupils who will eventually become my electors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the most unusual thing this morning is that the headmaster of the Opposition is not here. I was going to ask the whipper-in to do something about it, but he has now gone and/1 believe, left the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) in charge. If he wants some help in chastising the errant headmaster who has taken the day off and the errant whipper-in, who also appears to have taken at least a little time off, some of us will be happy to help wield the tawse in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enjoyed this morning's debate, and I enjoyed the last 10 minutes of Tuesday's debate. I enjoyed the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), because in the course of his speech—which highlighted a real problem—he seemed at last to be realising that academic excellence has a part to play in schools. He said that he approved of the academic stream. I certainly approve of the academic stream, and I hope that this means that I have a convert from among those who believe in the mixed-ability type of schools which have no academic stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome back the Opposition whipper-in, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I thought that he had decided to take the morning off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of the viability of classes with a diminishing school roll is real—whether we have the Bill or not. The hon. Member for Cathcart gave that away when he mentioned two schools in which the pupils were able to do higher grade in the major subjects. I took that to imply that they were unable to do higher grade in the minor subjects. I therefore pose a question to the hon. Member and to the Committee, because, if that is happening now, then surely a pupil who wishes to do a minor subject must be allowed to transfer to a school in which he can do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
those minor subjects, and not be left in a school where, for arguable reasons, he may benefit other pupils, but which is to his detriment because he cannot take the subjects that he wishes. There is a lack of logic in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Member concede that there is a danger if that logic is carried through, that we could reach the position of having four-year junior secondary schools, which is even more dangerous than what is being suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has led me to the next point, because if this is already happening due to school rolls declining, the logic must be that to prevent that happening children from outwith the area mentioned by the hon. Member for Cathcart must be forced into these schools to prevent the decline from continuing. If the Opposition disapprove of it happening because of falling school rolls, they must act to halt it even in the current situation. I understand their wish to do special engineering, but the education of Mr. and Mrs. Smith's child and his or her education is also important. If Mr. and Mrs. Smith know that the minor subjects are not available at a certain school, and they wish their child to have the chance to do those subjects, I believe that they have a right to ask that their child be transferred to a school where those subjects are available. I accept the consequences for the other children, but it must be remembered that all parents have a primary duty to see that their children are educated in a way that is proper to them.

We have had a confusing debate, because the hon. Member for Cathcart does not like the Government's replacement subsection. I understand the reason. During the speech of the hon. Member for Clackmanan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) I thought that sometimes he liked the Government's new subsection, because he thought that it restricted choice, and sometimes he did not. At the end of our last sitting the hon. Gentleman said that there had been a volte face by the Government. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" I am sure that it does not necessarily enjoy the support of all back benchers".—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 10th March 1981, c. 112.]</p></blockquote>
By " all Back Benchers " he implied " All Government Back Benchers ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have news for the hon. Gentleman. The amendment indeed enjoys the support of the Government Back Benchers. At least it enjoys my support, because it does what I sought to do in the amendment that I have withdrawn. If the hon. Member for Clackmanan and East Stirlingshire follows the logic of his own speech he will support us, because he seemed to welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, where there is an imbalance, local authorities will not be able to forbid pupil movement in the direction of a certain school on the grounds that they would then have to employ another teacher in that school when at the same time they may well be reducing the teacher employment in another school because of the falling school roll. It is perfectly sensible and perfectly reasonable,
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
and it is consistent with parents having some say in their own child's education, that what parents want should have some effect on the use to which an authority puts its teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least the hon. Member for Cathcart produced a logical argument. What we have seen from the hon. Member for Clackmanan and East Stirlingshire, in the midst of his confusion about the effect of the Government amendment, is the reality that the Labour Party pays only lip service to the idea of parental choice. In the speeches that we have heard this morning and at our last sitting there has not even been much lip service. The hon. Member for Clackmanan and East Stirlingshire revealed his condescending attitude towards any parent who wishes to exercise some sort of parental choice—any parent who takes an interest in his child's education and says—even, one must assume, inside a school— " I don't like the way that subject is taught. I do not like that teacher. I think my child should have another teacher—a better teacher." The hon. Gentleman calls such parents " moaning parents " and " alienated parents ". He seems to brush them aside. I have news for the hon. Gentleman. Those parents may be moaning parents, but they are the ones who are taking the responsibility for their children seriously. I welcome the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) has just said leads me to suggest that the real way to solve the problems is to involve parents within schools rather than to give them the option to get out and to hawk their child around until they find a school that suits them. A better answer would be to give the parents some authority and some way in which they are represented in the running of the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is a question of either or., One can have one solution and the other. I believe that the parents—perhaps through the school councils—should have some say in the way in which the school is run. I do not say that they should have control—that is a difficult question—but their voices should be listened to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts, that a majority decision or a general feeling may take a form that a parent does not like, both in what are called progressive schools and in what are called traditional schools. In either case it is only right and proper that a parent should be able to exercise a reasonable choice of sending his child to a school where the education is more akin to what he thinks his child should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Involvement with the school should not be the beginning and end of parental choice. If parents are allowed to be involved in the education of their children at any level, one must in logic accept that some parents will feel that tehir involvement can be properly exercised only if they can exercise choice on schooling. If clause is amended, authorities will be able to use their staff in a way that reflects parental demand and parental choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are now coming to the guts of the Bill. We are beginning to establish what it is about. It is a class Bill. When we start to talk about the need to move teachers, and the disruption that that will cause in schools, we begin to understand the real nature of the Bill and the threat that it contains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7, has been tabled to clarify subsection (3)(Z>)(i), which states
	<br><blockquote><p>" necessitate engaging an extra teacher in the school".</p></blockquote>
Presumably the disruption caused by the transfer of teachers and the souring of good industrial relations between teachers and education authorities is acceptable, but the extra public expenditure in volved in employing people, at at time when there are hundreds of teachers unemployed alongside the ranks of a mere 300,000 other Scots unemployed, is not.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who questioned the move to create two types of schools—the so-called " good school" and the so-called " bad school." The Opposition think that that would lead to the closure of the " bad schools ". I am not suggesting that all schools should be regarded as good schools. Nothing in the Bill or the proposed amendments suggest that the Government are trying to achieve good schools. In fact the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland admitted that during an interview published in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 4 October. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" With the falling birth rate difficult decisions are going to have to be made about school closures. I do believe very strongly that the opportunity should be given to parents to decide which schools are to close."</p></blockquote>
We all understand that those parents will decide by moving their children out of schools, and the pupils left behind will be under threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are fears that by the creation of so called " good schools " and " bad schools " the Tories are wishing to recreate the circumstances that would lead to the old senior secondary-junior secondary system in all but name. As evidence of that, I quote the comments made by the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association on the consultative paper " Admission to schools—A charter for Parents ". The SSTA said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Above all, we fear that the proposals, if implemented, might result in the first step being taken along the road to the re-establishment of two classes of school akin to the junior and senior secondaries which used to exist in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
The SSTA is not a militant Left-wing union. Its honorary parliamentary spokesman is the hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
ber for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who unfortunately is not in the Committee at present. Certainly the proposals have been rejected by his organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of a comprehensive system of education is under attack, by which I mean the establishment of neighbourhood schools where children, covering a wide range of intellectual ability, are offered a comparable range of educational opportunities. That principle will be under severe strain by the creation of " prestige " schools and " ghetto " schools. If the Tories were trying only to offer parents a choice in education, there would be no need for this legislation. Parental choice, within reasonable limits, which we in the Labour Party have never opposed, is already catered for adequately under section 28 (1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" so far as compatible with the provision of suitable instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure, pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents."</p></blockquote>
The attempts by the Tories on Second Reading to claim that Labour-controlled authorities have attempted to thwart parents' wishes were ably dismissed by my hon. Friends the Members for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to see how the Bill will lead to the creation of old-time junior secondaries and senior secondaries. The Educational Institute of Scotland in its comments about the Bill stated that the undesirable consequences of such proposals would include reduced morale among staff of any school losing pupils or teachers and the concentration in ghetto schools of children of uninterested and non-aspiring parents or less academically able children. It also fears that the ghetto schools would be able to offer only a—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do that, Mr. Hunt. However, amendment No. 7 states that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>" necessary for the authority to take an additional teacher into employment".</p></blockquote>
There are fears about that. I believe that there is no need for the amendment, because existing legislation and good industrial relations allow for teacher transfer if necessary. That is why I am trying to convey the unnecessary aspect of the amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Scottish education system has remarkable features which go back to the home environment. These amendments do not ameliorate some of the differences. My hen. Friend the Member for Cathcart mentioned the difference in attitude of parents with regard to their children's education. That is regularly demonstrated in reports and academic research into the Scottish education system and the Scottish class system. Parental interest in Scotland is certainly associated with middle-class achievement in schools. Middle-class parents have far higher
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
expectations for their children in general than do working-class parents. They take an interest in the type of. schools that their children attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to ensure that working-class parents, whom we mainly represent, have their rights protected also. I am net suggesting that working-class families are not concerned about their children's education, but on the whole Scottish working-class families live in dread of unemployment. We want to make sure that the Bill does not in any way affect or attack the rights of their children, and we believe that our amendment would move towards safeguarding those rights. Those parents live in the 24-hour expectation of the axe of unemployment falling on them, and they do not have enough knowledge or time to worry about their children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment does not help industrial relations in schools in any way. There are enough unemployed teachers to ensure that we could give real parental choice. The Secretary of State could, by increasing the level of rate support are the regional authorities—begin to ensure that grant given to education authorities—which we know this type of provision was unnecessary. More finance would then be available to take on the extra teachers that are required even now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister tried to justify this type of amendment by using the arguments that he used in January 1980, when he claimed that in September 1979 local authorities employed 18 per cent, more primary teachers than were needed, and that there was a 6 per cent, so-called " over-staffing " above Red Book standards in the secondary sector. His arguments were taken apart at the time by the Educational Institute of Scotland, which said that he was simply playing with figures. However, I do not want to go into that matter further, as I shall probably shoot off at a tangent from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more relevant was the Tory Party policy paper on education that the Minister drew up with the hon. Member for Argyll in September 1978, in which he regretted the level of teacher unemployment in Scotland. But where is that regret now? It is certainly not in the amendment that he is trying to force on the Committee. It appears that he will argue that black is black when he is in Opposition, and that he will argue the opposite when he is in power, because the amendment would preclude the employment of an extra teacher. One can only conclude that Conservative Members are enthusiastic supporters of the spirit of the parents' charter, but are not prepared to will the financial means to back it up. The hands of both the Treasury and the Prime Minister can be seen in the writing of the amendment, because it has to fit in with the Government's plan to reduce public expenditure. There would be no need for the Labour Party to sabotage the parents' charter—if it so wished— because the Government are already shooting it down with their own proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was the amendment introduced? Was it for clarification or the need to cut public expenditure? I hope that the Minister will also clarify a further
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
point. Staffing levels will determine the number of pupils to be taken into any one school, because of teachers' conditions of service. The maximums will be 33 pupils per class in non-practical subjects, stretching to 39 in exceptional circumstances, and 20 pupils per class in practical subjects. Can the Minister explain why the transfer of teachers from one school to another can be justified as the readjustment of staffing levels, when the employment of other teachers cannot? Once the optimum number of pupils has been defined by such staffing levels, those levels may operate only in theory for one or two periods in each school day. Extra teachers may need to be employed to change the theoretical situation into a real one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to tell us how he thinks the amendment will help the situation in Dundee. For instance, in a school in my constituency—Kirk-ton high school—pupils studying sixth-year science subjects have been forced to transfer to Lawside academy for those studies because of the failure of Tayside Tories to employ teachers. That failure of will is causing serious disruption to classes in the Dundee division of Tayside education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the majority of schools in Tayside, a number of parents would argue that there is a need to employ more teachers. The Government amendment would no nothing about the fears of those parents about their children's education, although amendment No. 8 goes much further down the road to making sense of the Bill. I should certainly argue that there is no need for the Bill. As I said, it simply seeks to clarify the difference between the two sides of the Committee in attitude and responsibility towards working-class families. I shall certainly join my hon. Friends in voting against amendment No. 7 and shall support amendment No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extremely good debate. It has exposed differences in philosophy, but much more important, it has shown that a difficult choice has to be faced by the Committee. There are two distinct sets of rights, both of which are good in themselves. There is the right of individual parents to choose, and the right of parents for their children to have a decent education in neighbourhood schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great strength of the education system in Scotland, as I have seen it, is the neighbourhood school. The aim of the educational process must be to strengthen the content of education in the schools which are available in a given locality so that educational opportunity is spread as evenly as possible. That is probably where the Government's amendment falls down. It envisages a transfer of resources, in practical terms, away from certain schools to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties facing both the Committee and the Government is that, by attempting to legislate to cover the rights of parents in regard to choice, and so on, they have to lay down certain conditions. The terms of the Bill will govern the situation. I believe that the Bill as presently drafted is probably better than it would be if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
amended, and that there should be a restriction on placing a child in a school if it would
	<br><blockquote><p>" necessitate engaging an extra teacher in the school ".</p></blockquote>
Obviously, as the hon. Member for Glasgow Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) clearly put it, that creates a close casual connection in transfer from one school to another. There is a clear gain to the school to which the transfer is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an additional teacher has to be taken on, it will obviously have a direct impact on the operation of the school and on the resources of the local authority. Perhaps the restriction, as it was framed, is the fairest way in which the matter can be put, and the more general change proposed in Government amendment No. 7 is not particularly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One practical problem is that the right of choice will be exercised in any event, because the reduction in school rolls means that more places will be available in certain schools to which pupils from other senior secondary schools might go. That, combined with the restrictions on finance which are also a fact of life, will make it difficult for education authorities easily to build up facilities in the school of choice, except at the expense of the school or schools in which there has been a decline of one pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment turns upon the use of resources. If it is correct—as I think it is—that educational opportunity has been restricted—and there are figuers to show that the numbers of children going to university from areas of deprivation have not increased in recent years—it means that there is a weakness in our existing educational structure. Far from building up the centres of excellence, to which reference has been made, which is a good thing, care must also be taken to ensure that there is no diminution of resources in terms of finance—in books and, above all, in teachers—to existing schools in the deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have referred to the problem—particularly the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross)—that neighbourhood schools are usually of mixed class backgrounds, but occasionally that is not so, and certain difficulties have been encountered as a result. It is not easy for teachers in schools in deprived areas to carry out their work, particularly if parental involvement is less. I have been informed by one school council that the existence of large scale unemployment in the area that the school serves is having a deleterious effect on education in the school, because the motivation to learn is slackening as pupils recognise that even when they obtain qualifications or pass examinations they do not necessarily get employment afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate. The way in which I vote will be dictated by the need to maintain as many resources as possible for schools in deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficult choice, because I accept what the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said, that parents have the right of choice for their children, but in practical terms—and this may be a difficulty
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
regardless of what we say, here—the drop in school rolls may have an impact on staffing particularly on the higher classes of the senior secondary schools. It is not an easy choice, but I am grateful to both the Government and the Opposition for tabling amendments that have caused me to consider seriously how I shall vote at the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks at the beginning of the debate on the amendment were brief. Nevertheless they revealed what I can only describe as the hypocrisy of certain aspects of the Government's policy expressed in this so-called parents' charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the game away. The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) used the term " lip-service ", but it is now clear that it is the Government who are paying mere lip-service to real freedom of choice. The thinking behind the amendment emphasises the fact that the Government have no real commitment to extending the freedom of the vast majority of parents in Scotland or the opportunity for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use willing the end—or pretending to will the end—without also willing the means. Willing the means, in this case, involves willing the resources. I have always maintained that a teacher is probably the most valuable educational resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said in public—perhaps he may confirm this today—that in his estimation there are far too many teachers employed in the schools in Scotland. He means that there are far too many teachers employed in the local education authority schools in Scotland. He seems intent on closing down colleges of education because he maintains that there are already more than adequate numbers of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that the pupil-teacher ratio is the best in the whole history of Scottish education. The staffing standards were largely inherited from the improvements introduced by the previous Labour Government, but despite the fact that there has been an improvement it would be wrong to imagine that the staffing standards in our schools are by any means optimal. There ought to be more room in our schools for the employment of more teachers. However, instead of encouraging local authorities to employ more teachers, especially in areas of need, and especially in schools in deprived areas, the Government are making it more difficult for local authorities to employ more teachers. They have set severe limits on the rate support grant, and now we have had the Chancellor's Budget Statement earlier in the week. Once these further savage cuts in educational expenditure are implemented there will be even more severe constraints on the ability of local education authorities to employ more teachers, at a time when hundreds of teachers in Scotland are on the dole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes said that in Scotland there is one of the best trained and best educated dole queues in Western Europe. That is something that no member of the Committee should be proud of. The Minister must take some responsibility for that state of affairs. He must try to improve opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
young teachers and, indeed* other well qualified young people who. are deprived of the right to work because of the Government's policy.

It is not that there are no jobs for those people to do. Existing alongside the best qualified dole queue in Western Europe there are some of the worst areas of multiple deprivation—including educational deprivation—in Western Europe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But there is nothing in the amendment or the Bill which would prevent the local authority from employing a dozen more teachers if it so wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody on either side of the Committee has said that the amendment would place an absolute prohibition on the employment of more teachers. But the Minister, by means of other orders, such as rate support grant, is making it difficult, if not impossible, for local education authorities to employ more teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should view the amendment in the light of the tremendous financial constraints which the Government are placing upon local education authorities, particularly in the employment of teachers, to which the amendment refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a case which was recently brought to light in my constituency. The chairman of the Dunipace school parents' association asked for my advice on the problem, which is, I think, quite relevant to the amendment. I should like the Minister's view on the matter. According to the chairman of the parents' association, there are 13 pupils due for transfer from the Dunipace primary school to Denny high school this summer. Already, it seems, there are vacancies for only five, so that once the other pupils move on to the high school there will be a total of only 18 vacancies—in other words, the school will be able to admit only 18 new pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are at least 25 children whose parents, who live in that area, want them to enrol at the Dunipace school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the children have brothers and sisters already at the school, and unless they are admitted
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
to the school, that will mean the division of families, brother against brother and sister against sister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that would be very unacceptable, and I hope that the Minister will accept in principle that it would be desirable to try to facilitate the entry of those pupils to the Dunipace school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the parents of pupils at Dunipace school may imagine that the Bill, and perhaps even the part of the Bill that we are now discussing will provide them with more opportunity to get their children into Dunipace school. At present there are five classes in the school, some of which are composite. In my letter to the director of education I stated that I realised the extreme difficulty of receiving sufficient allocation from this Government for a replacement building, but I asked the director of education to look into the possibility of getting at least the extra temporary hutted accommodation. It is not just extra accommodation which would be required, because if the school is to be made into a full, seven-class, primary school it would need extra teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the Bill that would help to provide extra teachers, because all that the Government amendment would do is facilitate the transfer of teachers from one school to another within the local education authority's area, instead of facilitating the employment of more teachers in order to accommodate the parents' choice. In other words, it appears that a result of the Bill could be not just to denude schools of pupils, but also to denude schools of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several members of the Committee particularly on the Opposition Benches, have referred to the undesirability of returning to the old days, when there was a system of first-class schools and second-class schools, particularly at secondary level. We believed that those days had gone. The Labour Government of 1964 to 1970 must take a great deal of credit for introducing comprehensive education. The local education authorities also deserve much credit for their efforts to upgrade what were formerly junior or four-year secondary schools into full six-year all-through comprehensive schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the terms of the amendment are taken to the limit, there is a danger—especially in deprived areas—that the number of children attending area schools may decrease, as may the number of teachers. Ghetto schools will then tend to develop which will not be in the interests of those children who live in areas of multiple deprivation. In some instances, even the viability of the school may be at stake, because once a school roll and the number of teachers that are employed fall below a critical level, the Minister or the education authority may question the need for its continuance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be tragic if areas that are already deprived in respect of lack of jobs, substandard housing, and so on were also to be deprived of their schools. The school is not merely a place for the education of children and young people; often it serves as a community centre as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
Some Conservative Members opposite may think that I am scaremongering when I say that non-viability can result in school closures. I hope that the number of closures will be kept to a minimum. But, in view of amendment No. 7, which will certainly make it easier, it is inevitable that the viability of some of the courses in many of the schools will be threatened. I refer especially to the viability of courses and classes in upper schools. There are schools which, for many years, never had the opportunity of presenting pupils for the higher grade examinations of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and they have only begun to do so within the last five to 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some upper schools the number of pupils in a class may not be as large as in others. Once that number falls below a certain level, some people may begin to ask whether it is educationally and economically viable to continue some of the courses. That is because of the financial constraints which the Minister has put on local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those courses are educationally useful because it is often important to teach in small groups, especially in deprived areas and in specialist classes in upper schools. But if the amendment results in a local authority being put under even more pressure to transfer teachers from one school to another —and the Minister appears to make no distinction between specialist and other teachers—my fear is that the exodus of teachers from certain schools will seriously threaten the educational opportunity of the remaining pupils. I will be a retrograde step and a return to the old days of the four-year secondary schools, which were a blight on the Scottish educational scene and which many Opposition Members worked hard to upgrade into full six-year comprehensive schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great pity if, as a result of this Tory measure, backdoor methods were used to reduce the status, reputation and quality of these schools in the eyes of parents, pupils and teachers, so that we reverted to the bad old days in which there was a first-class and a second-class type of school. We certainly do not want to return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Solicitor-General for Scotland is not here, because under Standing Order 63 he is entitled to be here and to speak. My next point concerns a legal matter, to which the Government Whip may like to respond, because the Minister is not qualified in law. I do not think that the Minister is qualified in many things, considering the mess that he is making of Scottish education, Scottish industry and everything else that he is put in charge of. I understand that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) is a member of the Faculty of Advocates. Perhaps he will give us the benefit of his learned view on what will happen if a parent takes a case as far as the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A geriatric old sheriff may be sitting on the bench, a man who is probably the product of a private fee-paying school, and who does not have a clue as to how the local education authority school operates, despite the fact that about 96 per cent, of children
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
in Scotland go to such schools. The old sheriff will be sitting there, and the parent, or the advocate acting on behalf of the parent, will be chuntering on that Mrs. A's boy or girl was not allowed into school X because the rotten old education authority said that under the terms of the Government amendment it was under no legal obligation to take the child at that school. The sheriff will look at the case and the point in law and ask " Is it feasible for this local education authority to transfer a teacher from school Y to school X? " The sheriff may decide to send for the director of education and say " Let me have, by the next sitting of the court, a complete list of all your schools and let me know how many teachers are employed in each of these schools so that I may have the final say on whether it will be feasible to transfer a teacher from school Y to school X."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imagine the legal complexities and educational complexities on which the sheriff has to reach a decision. He does not have a clue about the teachers' qualifications, because teachers have a variety of qualifications. There are teachers of English, teachers of mathematics and teachers of science. There are teachers who are qualified in both mathematics and science. There are teachers who* are qualified in English and geography, or history and modern studies. There is a great complexity and quality of qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the educational judgments. In my opinion, those judgments ought to be made by someone who is qualified in education. Even if it were technically possible for the education authority to transfer Mrs. C from school Y to school X, what, would be the reult of that transfer in education terms in the school from which Mrs. C transferred? Mrs. C may have been doubling-up in a couple of subjects. She may have been teaching both English and geography, and she may have been a guidance teacher too. In other words, she may have had a triple role. I have always maintained that teachers primarily teach not subjects but children. Yet there is, a rigid qualification system in Scotland—and there is merit in it as regards specialist teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can imagine a sheriff sitting in Stirling sheriff court or Edinburgh sheriff court and giving himself a headache trying to decide whether it would be feasible for Central regional council, for example, to transfer a teacher from one school to another. The complexities of this area are great, and I do not think that the Minister fully understands them. I believe that the amendment was handed to the Minister by the Scottish Consumer Council. With great respect to the members of that council, I do not think that they have fully grasped the complexities of the matter either. I foresee great legal entanglements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister again. Perhaps one of his civil servants could telephone Fielden House to find out whether the Solicitor-General for Scotland has surfaced yet. If he has, perhaps he could come and give us the benefit of his learned—or otherwise—views on this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and our discussion on it demonstrate that the freedom of choice that the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
are projecting is phoney. It is no freedom at all, because, like the rest of the Government's education policy, it is tied up in the financial straitjacket of the Government's economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not alone in saying that. I have here the 	<i>Scottish Educational Journal.</i> Before I sit down I should like to quote the views of this journal with reference to staffing standards, the employment of teachers and so on:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The new ' consultative' paper on staffing issued by the Secretary of State carries further—or at least sets forth more openly—the thinking which clearly lay behind Circular 1053. The term ' recommended staffing standards' has now been elided, in a way that is both dishonest and confused, with the more mechanistic expression ' projected pupil-teacher ratios'. This is symbolic of the complete subordination of educational objectives to narrow financial considerations which characterises the whale document."</p></blockquote>
If the Government are serious about the extension of parental choice and the improvement of children's educational opportunity, let them will the means for the extension of this freedom and the improvement of the opportunities for children and young people. It appears to me that the Government are interested in freedom only for those parents who are willing and able to pay. For the vast majority of parents and pupils in Scotland the Bill will give no increase in freedom of opportunity, as the debate so far proves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) said that the Scottish Consumer Council had brought the inadequacies of this subsection to the Government's attention. We are grateful to the council, because it was always our intention that a local authority could plead that part of the additional expense involved would result from the need to employ an additional teacher to meet a parent's request. The use of the word " engaging" in subsection 	<i>3(b)</i> leaves it open to doubt whether it refers to the employment of an additional teacher or to the transfer of a teacher already in employment from one school to another. We certainly would not like to- see a parent's request turned down for the latter reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that, with the decline in school rolls, which was fully recognised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), there may be cases in which one school may be somewhat oversubscribed for teaching staff and another, for whatever reason, may be a little short of staff or, at least, working to the recommended levels. In urban areas, particularly, where most of these problems usually arise, we think that it would be absurd for a local authority to be able to refuse a request simply because it was not prepared to make arrangements for a teacher to be transferred from one school to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to' clarify and liberalise the choice, from the parents' point of view, because it makes sense to allow a teacher to be transferred where no extra expense is incurred. The amendment makes it perfectly clear that the duty on the local authority remains unless it has to incur the expense of hiring an additional teacher. But, as I told the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), there is no restriction on a local authority hiring one or more
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
teachers to meet parental requests. It is only in defining the duty of the local authority, as laid down by the Bill, that this qualification has to be made. That is the purpose of amendment No. 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that beg the question, too, of what additional resources might be made available by central Government to enable a local authority to take on an additional teacher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to remember always that central Government provide, through the rate support grant, sufficient funding for teachers to meet the levels of provision laid down and many urban areas are given an additional percentage to meet the problem of urban deprivation. It is a matter for that authority to decide how to spend that grant and how its comitments will be spread and shared throughout the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is alright for the Minister to suggest that to the Committee. However, in reality it does not work. Even the model that the Government hold up to the outside world, Tayside regional council, does not have enough money from the rate support grant, and it had to exceed the Government guidelines by a considerable amount of money, because it does not have enough. Unless the Government are willing to give the education authorities—and thereby in reality, the regional authorities —more money, all this nonsense about putting in extra clauses is just papering over cracks, because the authorities do not have the finance to carry out the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are certainly not papering over cracks. We are providing the legislative framework by which, particularly at a time of declining pupil numbers, parents will be made more acutely aware of their rights, and local authorities will be able to deal with parental requests for a choice of school in an open and above-board way. The mystique will be taken out of the arrangements by which requests are dealt with, which, regardless of the question of resources, are certainly capable of being vastly improved. That is the whole motivation behind the Bill. In amendment No. 7 we are seeking to clarify the position in regard to the need to engage an additional teacher or transfer a teacher from one school to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must return to the point that in the White Paper published yesterday, and in statements during the past 12 months, he has consistently said that he wants fewer teachers in schools, that he does not want local authorities to take on extra staff, and that he is prepared to ensure that local authorities cannot afford to do that. Now he is telling local authorities that if the parents' charter is to operate, and they need to take on more teachers, they may do so, but he will provide no means to finance that. If he is choosing on the one hand to will the end, and on the other to refuse the means, it is just a cruel deception of the parents who will go through this process but find that their children will not be adequately taught because of lack of sufficient funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to tell the hem. Gentleman, with respect, that throughout this debate he has seemed to be in a state of confusion. The subsection, before or after amendment, will provide clearly that where a local authority feels that to meet a parent's request would mean hiring an; additional teacher, it will be entitled to refuse the request. That does not tie in with the hon. Gentleman's most recent contribution to our debate. I have tried to follow his remarks carefully, but I think that he has had some difficulty in understanding the purpose of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 would not be required, as the present wording of the subsection will cover any category of additional teachers, including class or specialist teachers. There is no definition of the word " teacher" in the Bill or in the 1980 Act. There is no mention of class or specialist teachers but only of teachers, and I do not think that we would wish to get involved in a debate about the definition of types of teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his important contribution to the debate, the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) summed up the case from the consumer's point of view, as well as from the teacher's point of view. He made it clear that his hon. Friends fully understood the intention. I am always prepared to listen to the consumer and hear what he has to say about education or anything else. I am glad that the hon. Member was able to recognise the importance of the suggestions of the Consumer Council. Indeed, he tabled an amendment along those lines, which he has since withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In view of what the Minister has said about "hon. Members and the hon. Member's hon. Friends", do I take it that the revolt of Conservative Back Benchers over the Budget has become so serious that he is no longer prepared to refer to them as his hon. Friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move on to the speech of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire, who is becoming known in Committee as the " instant Whip " because of the way in which he pops up. Clearly he takes his new whipping job seriously. Although I hesitate to say it, he has a bit to learn. One of a Whip's jobs is to control his colleagues, which includes controlling the time they spend speaking to various amendments. He could certainly learn how that job should be carried out in Committee from my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is conspicuous by his silence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The role of a Whip is to be conspicuous by his silence. It is also his role to influence his colleagues. But the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire is ever eager, clearly seeing his role as that of defender of State bureaucracy. He is so desperately worried about the poor education authorities, directors of education or anyone else who has to deal with legislation that he pays scant attention to the benefits that his own constituents will derive from the Bill. That applies not least
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
to the perfectly reasonable example that he gave in relation to the school at Dunipace. He asked how the local authority would deal with 25 requests for 18 places. I tell the hon. Gentleman— he will see this as we move on to other parts of the Bill—that one of the legislation's most important components is that a local authority will be required to lay down in advance the method of deciding on the treatment of each application. In other words, when there are more requests than places, parents will know in advance the criteria that the local authority will adopt when resolving; that problem. At present, parents do not know how their requests will be dealt with. Such matters are usually considered behind closed doors, often by the entire education committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman looks puzzled but, as he will see when we move on, that is precisely the sort of information that the local authority will be required to provide in advance. Parents will not then be puzzled about the procedure being adopted by the local authority when deciding which of the 25 children will get the 18 places in Duniplace school. That will clarify matters both for the local authority and for the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not matter what system the education authority—in this instance, the Central regional council—uses to determine the 18" successful applicants, because there will still be seven sets of disappointed parents and seven disappointed children. That will happen unless the Minister gives the council money so that the school can employ more teachers and provide extra accommodation. But he has refused to do that,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman deliberately misses the point. Listening to his earlier remarks and to the intervention that he has just made, I cannot believe that he does not understand the issue. If, for any reason, the local authority cannot supply extra teaching staff or extra accommodation,, someone will be disappointed. Surely what matters to his constituents is that they will know in advance what method the 'local authority- will apply when making its decision about which 18 out of the 25 children will have a place at Dunipace school. That is- better than taking the decision in a smoke-filled room behind bolted doors, which is how it is done at present in many local authorities. It is far better that people should know in advance what criteria the local authority will employ in making this decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The Minister will not get away with that. He knows full well that the education committee meetings of Central regional council are not held in smoke-filled rooms. Members of the public who are interested—including the Minister himself, and parents from Dunipace or anywhere else—can listen to the debates and see what decisions are taken. I am sure that come what may, even without this tawdry Bill, Central regional council would tell the parents exactly what criteria are used in deciding how to allocate the limited number of places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear it. 1 have said repeatedly that any local authority that operates a sensible and liberal method of giving choice to parents has nothing to fear from the Bill. But clearly the legislation is necessary not just because there are local authorities that do not operate in that way but because it is only fair that parents should know in advance what methods are being applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not concede that that will be little consolation to parents whose hopes have been built up by the creation of the massive appeals structure that he is envisaging, because at the end of the day it will not be possible to meet the wishes of all the parents? The decision will be taken neither in a smoke-filled room nor in the airy and bright rooms of Central region headquarters. It will be taken in some cap, or in some pack of cards, as in a lottery. The decision will be governed by nothing more than chance. It is a cruel deception of the parents' wishes when the places will have to be allocated with the help of a lottery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is utter nonsense. What the hon. Gentleman seemed to be beginning to say, before he involved himself on in argument about lotteries, was that because some people might be disappointed, no one should be able to exercise choice. In any such situation, some people will be disappointed. Regardless of that, the aim in die Bill and the aim of a local authority, with or without the Bill, is to satisfy as many parents as possible. That is something that can be done, and it may be done at present in many instances. All that we are saying is that the rules and procedures that are applied should be set out for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his remarks about the sheriff and how the sheriff would deal with an appeal case, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire—not for the first time—put a slur upon the Scottish Bench. He must know that the sheriffs deal with many matters that are more complex than the^ decision about a place in a school for a particular child. There is nothing unusual in such an argument going before a sheriff. The hon. Gendeman must also know that in pursuing his task the sheriff is entitled to call for information or for evidence of any kind that he considers necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of the hon. Gentleman about the Scottish Bench are very much his own personal feelings, though they may be shared by one or two of his extreme colleagues. They are not the views of the Committee as a whole or of the vast majority of people in Scotland, including his own constituents. It is only fair that at the end of the day, if a parent feels sufficiently aggrieved about the procedures adopted by the local authority and still wishes to pursue a matter of parental choice, he should be able to take his case to the sheriff—as he can at present, although under a lop-sided procedure—and take the advice of the sheriff about the method of selection adopted by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister seriously be happy with a situation in which a sheriff, with no experience at all in the mainstream of Scottish education and no qualifications in the field of education, might have to decide whether it was feasible for an education authority to transfer a teacher from any one of its schools into the school to which a parent wanted his child to go? He might have to examine a list of all the teachers employed by the education authority, and examine their qualifications, the pupil-teacher ratio and staffing standards in each school, and even the number of pupils in each course in each school. Would the Minister be happy for a sheriff to make a judgment on that? Would it not be better left to those with at least some qualifications in education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a sad commentary on the reputation of an education authority if a sheriff felt that he had to go to such lengths to establish the facts of a case. I repeat that sheriffs deal with matters much more technical and complex than these. They are perfectly capable of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendments are clearly helpful to the Bill. I repeat our indebtedness to the Scottish Consumer Council for passing on the advice of parents whose children are the consumers of Scottish education. I repeat what I said to the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), that his amendment is not necessary, because we do not specify the type of teacher in any legislation. He may therefore wish to seek to withdraw his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity of advising the Committee that at our sitting next Tuesday I shall move an additional sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not accept that the fact that the definition 'of "teacher" has not appeared in past legislation in the form contained in the amendment necessarily precludes its consideration in new legislation. We have checked this and find that, primarily, the word "teacher" has been used in respect of remuneration and appointment. We believe that with the functions of teachers, the whole matter is here drawn into sharp relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different types of teachers, with different types of responsibilities. In respect of primary education, as I have said, we wish to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that peripatetic teachers who presendy work under rigorous conditions— specialist teachers, as we have chosen to call them— would need some kind of protection. We feel, therefore, that they should be identified and that the needs of children who benefit from that specialist education should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether it is in order for me to comment now on the Minister's statement about his desire to try to railroad the Bill through, but I took the trouble, when trying to follow the Minister's remarks through the highways and byways of Scottish education, to find out when he rose to speak. It was at approximately 12.1 pm, and he sat down at about 12.19 pm. Eighteen minutes of reply from a Minister in a debate of this nature, although we are grateful for his serious consideration of our remarks, is too long.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 9 is concerned with the subjective reasons why local authorities should not permit freedom of parental choice. We are endeavouring in this group of amendments, by seeking to delete the words " significant" and " seriously " to make it clear that we consider that any increase in expenditure is undesirable as regards opportunity for parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here yesterday's 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> a newspaper which is not noted for its sympathy towards the Labour Party or Labour views on education. It contains an explicit message in its treatment of the 	<i>Financial Statement and Budget Report Red Book.</i>
The article is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Axe to fall on schools again ".</p></blockquote>
On a subsequent page it has the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Education main target for axe ".</p></blockquote>
The article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Mr. George Younger, Secretary of State for Scotland, put as brave a face as possible yesterday at Westminster on the prospect facing the Scottish Office and Local Government in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
We take the view that any increase in expenditure resulting from the application of the freedom of parental choice which the Bill purports to afford, would be unnecessary and undesirable, because it would hit at the best education of the rest of the children in Scotland. The article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Spending on education is planned to fall by 6 per cent, or £63m over the three years. Most of this reduction occurs in schools where a fall of around £53m is planned by 1983-84."</p></blockquote>
It is said that the 5 per cent, cut can be justified on the basis of a fall in pupil numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have already drawn attention to the fact that falling school rolls may make us reconsider our strategy on secondary education, and Labour Members are beginning seriously to examine different forms of education for post-16-year-olds. Although I should dearly like to discuss that topic this morning, I realise that the terms of the Bill do not afford us that opportunity. On Second Reading some of us critcised the Bill because it did not seek to grasp the nettles emerging en the Scottish education scene at present.

It is certainly fair to say that where there are falling school rolls and where the expenditure on staffing may be changed, certain fixed costs will remain, and it is simplistic for the Government to suggest that because there are falling school rolls there will necessarily be equivalent reductions in expenditure. That is a gross exaggeration of the truth. There are diseconomies of scale in the education system. If there are economies of scale when numbers are reduced, it is possible that the education system will come under more severe pressure, because staff numbers, heating levels, equipment and so on have to be maintained, and many of those do not fit into the neat calculations required by pupil-teacher ratios, which the Government's White Paper admits will be detrimentally affected by expenditure cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards amendment No. 9, our resolution to oppose this part of the Bill is even more strong, as is our desire to ensure that we do not have to think in terms of " significant". We are not sure what the word means. The definition in the Oxford Dictionary covers a range of concepts which do not necessarily apply to expenditure. As a time when local authorities are having to make cuts and watch their expenditure perhaps the words " unreasonable " or " excessive " would have been more appropriate adjectives to qualify expenditure, because those words are included in the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Significant" does not mean very much to us. We hope that the Minister will tell us what it means in terms of percentages, and by how much he is prepared to allow the rate support grant to be increased to meet the cost of freedom of parental choice. We are not prepared for local authorities' budgets to be attacked by central Government cutting rate support grant. We are not prepared to stand idly by while these attacks take place and, at the same time, have vague definitions of expenditure, when the Government's whims and fancies are to be exercised through the so-called parents' charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendment No. 9, we consider any increase in expenditure incurred as a result of the application of the parents' charter to be too much at present. There may be times in the future when parents can send their children to one school or another without any regard to cost. But at present, when some schools are fighting for their existence, when valuable teaching time is taken up because people such as assistant head teachers have to raise funds for often vital school supplies, it is virtually obscene for the Minister to allow this vague and insubstantial legislation to go through. We are not prepared to have a definition of expenditure which includes words such as " significant".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
The Minister must tell us what he means by " significant ". If he cannot tell us, will local authorities have to go to court to obtain an adequate definition if they choose not to afford the opportunities to parents under the parents' charter? At a time when the Government are determined to starve the education system of much-needed funds, we consider the vagueness of the definition of expenditure as implied by the word " significant " to be most unsatisfactory. It must be clarified, and we hope that the Minister will explain in some detail what he means by that word. If it relates to expenditure, what percentage of increase would he tolerate, and what percentage of increase in the rate support grant would he provide to cover that? The Committee needs to be told about those matters before it proceeds further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 10, which seeks to remove the adverb " seriously " from the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>" be seriously detrimental to the continuity of the child's education".</p></blockquote>
We consider that a child's education is either affected or not—that is, it is affected detrimentally or it is affected beneficially. We are at a loss as to what " seriously " means in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the continuity of a child's education is to be detrimentally affected, I imagine that that could mean that the continuity could be affected by, for example, a child attending a school which does not start a particular subject until, say, the third year. In Scotland there is no 11-plus transfer. Instead, there is a 12-plus transfer. Children spend seven years in primary school and four years compulsorily in secondary school, or until they reach the age of 16 or the nearest leaving date thereafter. Normally they can stay on for a maximum of another two years after that. That is why we talk about a six-year school and about youngsters who go from the first and second year, which may be to the age of 13, on to what is known as the common course. Thereafter, in their third and fourth years, they begin O-grade courses, which are similar to the English O-level courses. Those O-grade courses are the point at which the children begin to specialise in certain subjects. In the first and second years foundation work is done in the basic subjects and there are often taster courses in the other subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a point at which continuity of education is important. Within a range of perhaps eight or nine subjects a child might be able to study in the first year one language, two or three social science subjects, two or three science subjects, mathematics and English. Eight or nine subjects would be available to the child in the first two years. The variety of courses available is very often inconsistent within a local authority. In urban areas it may be affected by staffing levels and other difficulties. In certain subjects it is possible for the continuity of a child's education to be seriously interrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give an example. Let us say that a child studies the first year of French in a course where French is studied in the first and second years, with the option of taking German as an additional subject in the third year if the child shows some-inclination towards languages or some facility for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
them. If the parents wish to move the child to another school and a period of a year or 18 months passes before the parents decide that they do not approve of the school or that, for whatever reason, they wish the child to be transferred, the 18 months of French will be lost if there is no French course available at the new school. There will then be a serious break in the continuity of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give a variety of examples, some of a more complicated nature involving differing approaches towards the science subjects. How science can be best taught is at the moment a matter of some debate. Should there be modular courses of a multi-disciplinary nature in which various science disciplines are related at different points so that the childdren go from one module to another? Should we, alternatively, retain the old-style courses, where the pupils simply started off with biology and studied it for two years and did two periods of physics and two of chemistry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The richness and diversity of our Scottish educational system means that parents could well have a wide range of choice, and as I have said earlier they could exercise that choice for capricious reasons. But even if the parents have their child transferred for the best reasons, they could inadvertently disturb the progress of his education at a time of crucial development when interest in and affection for subjects is being created. The question of continuity lies at the heart of our educational arguments against the Bill. We ask the Minister to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the Minister is not an educationist. I recognise that in many instances he is net very interested. I am grateful that he has now started to pay attention again. I will not strain your patience, Mr. Hunt by rehearsing the arguments to which the Minister has paid no attention for the past 10 minutes. I only hope that the paper that has now come to his hand will in some respects meet the points that I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the continuity of the child's education lies at the heart of the whole consideration of the educational aspect of parental choice. Parents may take the view that it does not matter and that the other advantages afforded by the element of parental choice are more important. If they are more important, that merely serves to justify our arguments about some of the criteria by which parents will seek to exercise their rights under the charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be irresponsible of us not to air these educational questions, because there is a richness of diversity in the Scottish comprehensive education system. We keep returning to the point that in the main we are talking of legislating for what are, in effect only four main educational centres— Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow. In most of the small towns the range of choice is very limited. There may be one, or at most, two schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area in the town of Alloa, there are three schools, one of which is denominational—that is,
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
it provides education under the joint aegis of the education authority and the Roman Catholic church specifically for children of Roman Catholics. The others are non-denominational schools, to which Catholics may go if they so wish, but which in the main provide a non-Catholic education with a moral content in keeping with the traditions of the Church of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, effectively, there is a choice of two schools. As it happens, the quality of education provided in each is of a high standard, and parents do not particularly choose one or the other. But if they choose to send their children to any other school in the county, they would incur substantial travelling expenses. As the Bill makes no provision for travelling expenses in this area, it is most unlikely that parents outside urban areas will seek to choose between one school and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the urban areas—Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee—a diversity of approach has developed. It has always been my wish that funds would be available to improve the overall standard of education and that our economy would be sufficently healthy that the relationship between deprivation and lack of educational fulfilment could be broken. If it were broken, we should probably have the ideal conditions for parental choice to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we have been unable—I am not trying to make a party point, because this has happened over a number of years—to sustain the level of economic growth and share its fruits among all our people, and this national disease has meant that some schools have become more or less desirable than others. Therefore, parents have chosen, for whatever reason, to send their children across the city where there is good and, in the case of Edinburgh cheap, public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where that happens, the continuity of education can be broken. I used to teach in the western part of Edinburgh, which I am sure, is well known to the mute, inglorious Government Whip. Within a short travelling distance, there are three schools, all of a very high standard. One is Craigmount high school, in which I had the privilege of working for three years and which has a somewhat progressive approach to education. It put emphasis on such things as common course teaching, where, as much as possible, children are not split up in the first two years on the basis of ability. There is no setting. The children go as tutor groups or register parties to the same class for virtually all subjects, with extractions for remedial work, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal high school is another school close by, which I am sure is equally well known to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). It was transplanted from the city centre to the suburbs. The school, which has a long and distinguished educational tradition, has become a comprehensive but still retains many of the traditional education approaches. Therefore, in the teaching in the first and second years the school has a more traditional approach and the common course approach does not, exist in that school to any great extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
There is a third school within walking distance— Craigroyston high school. It was mentioned earlier as being a junior secondary school. Until the introduction of the comprehensive system, this school catered only for three years of education. It was increased subsequently to four years. It caters almost exclusively for a public housing catchment area which meets virtually every index of social and economic deprivation. Nevertheless, it has become one of the showpieces in meeting the challenges of that situation. The staff have been able to develop courses and educational approaches which in the eyes of many people have been revolutionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point with some caution, Mr. Hunt, because I am not sure which constituency you represent. I should have taken the trouble to discover that. People of a different political persuasion from my own—although I realise that that is not a consideration in the case of the Chair— tend to represent seats in the southern part of the country. I may be doing you a discourtesy, Mr. Hunt, in suggesting that you come from the South. Hon. Members from north of the Wash feel that the political judgment of the electorate in the South is inferior in some respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a certain prejudice in the South of England in some local authorities and among some Conservative Members against what smacks of progressive education. Tht is a regrettable rejection of an exciting aspect of our educational provision. Nevertheless, in Scotland there is a happy marriage of progressive education and traditional respect for quality and excellence which lies at the heart of the kind of provision that parents want, however inarticulately, for their children. At Craigroyston high school there is that happy marriage of a progessive approach with a strong respect for the standards of excellence and the need rigorously to apply the highest standards of Scottish pedagogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of the three schools which I have mentioned caters for different groups of people. Each school in its own way affords opportunities to the children. I am not suggesting that parents of children at Craigmount may decide for the wrong reasons to send their child to the high school or parents of children at Craigroyston to send their children to Craigmount. That could be achieved without any major expenditure on bus fares. The Lothian Region has an extremely well run transport authority, which has taken a decision to keep bus fares down by subsidising them through the rates. Many of us are happy to pay those rates, because we are aware of the good services which are provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that argument as a ratepayer. I am concerned about the fact that certain aspects of parental choice will not be funded by this legislation, but we shall discuss that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There happens to be, by a happy coincidence, three excellent schools offering different approaches to education. I chose to speak about those schools partly because I wanted to bring the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West into the discussion. I get a wee bit disheartened at times when my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) chooses to castigate him as my hon. Friend was an excellent teacher, who, in the Scottish tradition, tended to frighten the pupils, not necessarily by the use of violence or anything like that, but simply because he commanded respect by the use of verbal abuse and fear. That is a perfectly legitimate teaching tactic, as I am sure the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is aware, although I believe from his public statements that he was more inclined to use the belt than to use the harshness of his tongue. I recognise that one method is probably as harmful as the other, and to him one would be as much a source of delight as the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw that last remark about my getting delight from belting children. I very rarely did that, but when I did it gave me no delight. I should not like to starting trading questions about how often the hon. Member or his hon. Friend belted children and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I recognise that I went over the score there. I do not want to appear priggish, but I have never owned a belt and I never belted when I was a teacher. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That shows how much the hon. Member knows about Scottish education. He does not even know what a tawse is when he sees one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubtless, we shall return to that matter at a later stage. However, I withdraw the reference I made to the hon. Member for Argyll taking pleasure in inflicting pain on young people. I recognise that that is a characteristic of some members of our profession, and I am happy to acquit the hon. Member of that charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not grateful for that intervention, but we recognise that that is the way the Government operate.
