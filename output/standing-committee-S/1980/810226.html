<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Gourlay. I should not like anyone to think that I am carping, but it is again most unfortunate that we still have not had the Hansard report of the late sitting. I know that the Committee sat after midnight, and it is only that last part that is not available. I am aware of the pressure on Hansard and on the printers, but in this modern age of technology it is absurd that we cannot have the report available before now. Indeed, the Official Report of the early evening part of the sitting is only just available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon Gentleman for that point of order. I wrote to the Leader of the House on 10 February about the previous similar point of order. I have not yet received a reply. I was very disturbed. Late last evening before the House adjourned I made inquiries about the Official Report. As the hon Gentleman says, the first part of the report of the seventeenth sitting is now available in the Committee room. We shall press the representations again, although we hope to finish the Committee stage this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I want to make the matter clear. It is quite important, and it is no reflection on the Hansard reporters. Some of us raised it during 'consideration of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill. It inhibits the genuine desire of Opposition Members to co-operate with the Government.<br><br>
I have never objected to late sittings in any Committee. Once,one gets into a Committee there comes a time when there is a certain value in them, but it is defeated if, for instance, one cannot get the Hansard reports at a reasonable time to make possible the continuity which is necessary on any Committee. The Minister and the Whips' Office should take this on board. I do not understand. It must have something to do with money,:because 'the age of technology is such that we are supposed to be able to 'have a better service, and we are not getting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everyone will have heard the point of order, and no doubt the Leader of the House will again be acquainted with the hon Gentleman's remarks. The matter is 'a disadvantage to the Chair as well as to members of the Committee, so the Committee can be assured that some action will be taken.</span></p>

New Clause 14</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PLANNING APPLICATIONS AND CONSIDERATION OF THE NEEDS OF THE DISABLED</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"In section 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 (which provides for the determination by planning authorities of applications for planning permission) the following subsection shall be inserted after subsection (4)—
<br><blockquote><p>(4A) In determining any application for planning permission as regards any building or premises in relation to which a duty is imposed by any of sections 4 to 8A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (facilities at premises open to the public to include, where reasonable and practicable, provision for the needs of the disabled etc.) the planning authority shall ensure that the applicant is aware of such duty.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—[Mr. Rifkind.]</p>
<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take amendment (a) to the new clause and new clause 7—Access for disabled people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may make for proper debate if, having formally moved the Second Reading, I now allow the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who originally raised this matter by tabling a new clause for consideration, to make known his views. I shall then be in a position to respond to the hon Gentleman and to explain at the same time the thinking behind the Government's new clause.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment (a) to the new clause, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"and may impose conditions to ensure that such a duty is carried out".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will not think it churlish if I claim some credit for this Government initiative, on behalf not only of myself, but in particular of the hon Members for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) and for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). I suspect that it was they who concentrated the Minister's mind, perhaps more than some of us on the Opposition Benches. This is one of the happy occasions when everyone on both sides of the Committee has the same objectives. I have no doubt that there will be a constructive debate on 'how best to achieve them for the benefit of disabled people in Scotland.<br><br>
The Government 'have taken the carpet from underneath my feet by tabling new clause 14, but I have no complaint about that, because the Labour Party have no monopoly of concern for disabled people. I am aware that hon Members in all parties 'have a genuine desire to help 'disabled people to help themselves.<br><br>
My new clause 7 is intended to impose an obligation on developers to satisfy planning authorities

as to whether it is practical or reasonable, in terms of section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, to provide access to new public buildings for disabled people. I should like to make a brief reference to the report of the Silver Jubilee committee on improving access for disabled people, published in 1979, which emphasised the fact that better legislation and access for disabled people to public buildings was urgently needed. The report said, amongst other things:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because local authorities, even with the best will in the world, cannot force anyone seeking planning permission to include proper access provision, new and stricter laws were needed to block this loophole."</p></blockquote>
It went on to cite a joint circular issued in August 1970, immediately after the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act was enacted, by four United Kingdom Departments. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where private development is concerned, local authorities are asked to take appropriate action to draw developers' attention to the Section, for example by a notice at the time when planning permission is granted; though the Section does not provide grounds on which planning permission or approval under the building regulations can be withheld."</p></blockquote>
That seems clear enough at the United Kingdom level, though perhaps the Minister will be able to help us in due course as to what the situation will be for Scotland.<br><br>
The Silver Jubilee Committee's recommendations included the following:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that legislation be introduced to make the access sections of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 mandatory. Further, we recommend that the law be amended to place on developers the burden of proof that to make a new building accessible would be unreasonable and impracticable."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the stumbling blocks at the moment. I fear that the Minister's new clause does no more than to repeat the well-meant abut in practical terms ineffective terminology of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, section 4(1) of which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any person undertaking the provision of any building or premises to which the public are to be admitted, whether on payment or otherwise, shall, in the means of access both to and within the building or premises, and in the parking facilities and sanitary conveniences to be available (if any), make provision, in so far as it is in the circumstances both practicable and reasonable, for the needs of members of the public visiting the building or premises who are disabled."</p></blockquote>
The problem here is whether something is practicable or reasonable. There seems to be ample evidence that this provision is being used by developers and architects as a loophole which has enabled them not to provide the access required for disabled people. I fear that the new clause does no more than to repeat that well-meant terminology, and will simply leave this gaping loophole.<br><br>
It seems that the Government's new clause will serve only to draw attention to a duty which no one can be compelled to carry out. The new clause is entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Planning applications and consideration of the needs of the disabled".</p></blockquote>
Many disabled people would agree with me that perhaps what they need is less consideration and more practical assistance. That is what all of us in the Committee seek to achieve.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
The question of access to public buildings for disabled people is of essential importance. They can achieve a great deal for themselves, but if they cannot go through doors or up steps they are prevented from doing all kinds of ordinary things. Too often developers and architects protest "But there is only one step." One step is one step too many if one is on crutches or in a wheelchair. That was brought home to me forcibly by a nextdoor neighbour who has been crippled with rheumatoid arthritis since she was a teenager, but who nevertheless managed to go for a walk from time to time, using her crutches. One day the regional council put a new kerb along the pavement outside her house, and she could not get down that 5in. step unless somebody lifted her. I am happy to say that the regional council has now lowered the kerb at that point. But that illustrated to me that one step is one step too many for many disabled people.<br><br>
We are all agreed about the need to make the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act work better. The question is whether the new clause will achieve that. I fear that it does no more than to reiterate a piece of legislation which is already known by many disabled people to be almost useless. It draws attention to a duty which is not enforceable.<br><br>
Disabled people are growing a little tired of attention being drawn to their needs. They want and deserve more practical help. I emphasise the fact that the present legislation appears to be defective. I asked for advice on this from my own local planning authority, the Borders regional council, and I have had a letter from Mr. McKenzie, the master of works of the Borders regional council, who has recently been designated the access officer. He wrote to me:
<br><blockquote><p>"While the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and Amendment Act 1976 lay a duty on developers to provide access and other facilities, there would appear to be no enforcement procedures and I see my role, therefore, as that of an adviser. The arrangement I have made with my staff is that, in appropriate cases, they shall advise applicants for building warrants of the terms of the Code of Practice dealing with access for the disabled during the normal processing of warrant applications."</p></blockquote>
So all that he can do is to advise.<br><br>
I think that all members of the Committee received a letter from the Highland regional council yesterday. The director of social work, Mr. Bailey, writes in reference to my new clause:
<br><blockquote><p>"While this amendment will not correct all the present difficulties, it is bound to lead to a major improvement for all disabled people, most of whom are elderly. The present legislation is simply not strong enough, and any amount of recent development remains inaccessible. My colleague, the Director of Physical Planning, totally supports this letter, having tried hard to improve accessibility under the present laws."</p></blockquote>
Here are two people whose job it is to make the present law work, and they both confirm that they cannot do it.<br><br>
Positive action on this matter has never been more relevant than this year—the International Year of Disabled People. There has been a great deal of publicity about their needs, and their hopes have been raised that action will be taken. In common with a number of hon Members on both sides of the House I wrote earlier this year to the Minister's hon Friend, the Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for social services, to urge the Government to take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0911">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
positive steps to assist disabled people during this year.<br><br>
It is worth remembering that one of the objectives of the International Year of Disabled People, to which the United Kingdom has wedded itself, is:
<br><blockquote><p>"Promoting all national and international efforts to provide disabled persons with proper assistance, training, care and guidance, to make available opportunities for suitable work and to ensure their full integration in society".</p></blockquote>
That must surely include making it possible for them to get through the doors of shops and other public buildings and offices.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Minister replied when I wrote to him on that occasion in a genuinely sympathetic manner, but he did not go so far as to promise action. His hon Friend is proposing action, and I know that he intends it to be specific. I am grateful to him for the advice that he has given me on this subject, and for meeting me in his office last night to discuss the new clause. My only worry is that it will not he as effective as the Minister genuinely intends it to be.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman has indicated to me that planners already have the authority to impose conditions when they see fit, but the evidence is that they have not been able to do so. After I spoke to the Minister, I was in touch with the director of physical planning of East Lothian district council, who consulted some of his colleagues in planning in other parts of Scotland. He confirmed that planning authorities could impose planning conditions as they saw fit, subject to three overriding conditions: first, that the conditions should be necessary—fair enough; secondly, that they should be reasonable—likewise, fair enough; thirdly—and this is the Catch 22 in this case—that this should not be a factor which is controllable under legislation. I think that that is the problem.<br><br>
I have already referred to section 4 of The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. It seems from that section 4 that these developments are controlled under other legislation, and that legislation seems to be defective in that it does not enable any particular authority to enforce those provisions. This seems to be the rub.<br><br>
The amendment to the new clause is intended to do away with the uncertainty and confusion, and specifically to enable—I stress "to enable", not to compel—local authorities to impose and to enforce conditions in planning consents which will not merely draw developers' attention to their statutory duties but which will also ensure that they carry out those duties where practicable and reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). He has done a service not only to the disabled but to this Committee in bringing forward his new clause. It is a tribute to his diligence that he sees within this legislation the opportunity for introducing such a clause.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon Gentleman will agree that it is amazing that what we are trying to do is to ensure that a public place is a public place. Until now, in far too many instances, a "public place" has meant a place accessible only to the able-bodied. The extra
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 710</span>
ordinary lack of action in the past is being highlighted in this debate. What we are talking about is making a public building accessible to all the public, including those who are not able-bodied, something which, particularly in this International Year of Disabled People, should be at the heart of everything that is done by the Government and by local government, in any way that they can. We are not trying to do something special; all that we are trying to do is to make "public" mean what it says.<br><br>
Although the hon Member said that what could be done under the amendment was fairly limited, I believe that it is an essential part of what needs to be done for the disabled—the education of the public to make them understand that there is a need, not only in public buildings but in private buildings, to ensure that disabled people can have access and lead reasonably normal lives.<br><br>
In a strange way, the problem faced by my hon Friend the Minister and by all who try to legislate in this area is summed up in the words "practicable and reasonable". As often as not, in my experience, those two words mean cost. The problem in dealing with the disabled and with housing and buildings for them is that there is a cost barrier. Because at present most jobs done for the disabled are one-off jobs, they cost more. If they can be done to a sufficient extent, so that the wider doors become standard doors and not one-off, the cost will inevitably fall. In a sense what we are trying to do is to educate local authorities, builders and the public to ensure that this development is done to a sufficient extent, so that the cost is reduced and to make it a standard procedure in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member has emphasised the problem of whether something is reasonable and practicable. Does she not also accept that there is a need for legislation that is enforceable? We have evidence that in England the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 has been put to the test in only two cases in 11 years, once in Liverpool—a branch of Tesco—and more recently in Walsall, and has been found to be wanting. It is not enforceable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon Gentleman says. Up to now the catch has been in the words "reasonable" and "practicable". One of the considerations I had in looking at both the hon Member's new clause and that of the Government is that neither of them define what is "reasonable" and "practicable". In my experience, in the end that will always be to a large extent judged on cost. This is why it is so important that the public, builders and local government are educated into creating enough of these new developments so that the cost begins to drop—that cost barrier is passed, and that argument of "reasonable" and "practicable" in terms of cost eventually disappears.<br><br>
We are really talking about very simple things—the width of doors, so that they are wide enough to allow a wheelchair to enter, ramps and rounded steps. We are not talking about anything particularly expensive there. We are talking about proper toilet provision, which is not costly, but often has been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0912">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 711</span>
regarded as difficult to produce. Indeed, I understand that a building was constructed recently where a toilet for the disabled was put in but could not be used because there was no way in which someone in a wheelchair could get to it. When we talk about them like this, such matters seem common sense, but often they are ignored by developers and planning authorities.<br><br>
Obviously, we cannot achieve complete compliance with these needs overnight, but by improving awareness, 'particularly public awareness, we can create a public pressure on local authorities and developers to stop this insidious, if unintentional, discrimination in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is being sympathetic and helpful, and I know that he has an interest in this subject. We all accept that awareness is useful, but some of us suggest that it is not enough. The addendum suggested by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) aspires to impose conditions on a planning consent that will ensure that the essential facilities for the disabled which hon Members have been discussing are included. Is the hon Gentleman in favour of that? He seems to be getting himself dangerously near the position of saying that awareness is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon Gentleman that I am not trying to be disingenuous. I have a genuine interest in the problem, and have had for some time. I fear creating a situation in which we create hopes for the disabled which are then not fulfilled. This has been done far too often in the past, and in many ways many of us have been guilty.<br><br>
If I have misread the amendment, I am sure that the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian will tell me, but, taking it in the context of the legislation in which it comes, I believe that it seems to be still tied to the condition that these developments have to be "practicable and reasonable". This is why I am concentrating on the one catch phrase, those words.<br><br>
In a sense, what is more important than whatever happens here today is to ensure that two things happen. One is that there be public pressure which will make the use of the let-out of "practicable and reasonable" less easy. The second is that we create a situation in which the cost argument disappears, because what is at the moment one-off becomes standard and therefore cheaper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to restrain oneself when one hears a speech like that after going through this Bill and others in the House. The hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) did not even add his name to the new clause of my 'hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), although two of his colleagues did. Let us have no more of that kind of humbug from him. When he looks at the record of 'his Government on what they have not done for the disabled, he will see that it is absolutely deplorable.<br><br>
All that we ask for is a very minimal thing, but the record of the past 18 months or 'two years shows
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 712</span>
the Government actually blocking a Bill designed to help the disabled, introduced by a Welsh Nationalist Member, supported by all parties. My hon Friend is quite right that the Government are moving their own new clause today only because two of their supporters added their names to his new clause and the Government were in danger of defeat. So it is not conviction on the Government's part; it is force majeure. Let us have no more humbug about that.<br><br>
I quoted another example in an earlier debate, when I said that this same Government were actually stopping the continuation of the building of 10 houses for people in wheelchairs in Glen-rothes; in one new town 10 houses for people in wheelchairs have been stopped dead in their tracks. Let us cut out all this 'humbug. The Government know that the House in general wants this kind of provision, and they are bowing to that. It is not from any kind of conviction.<br><br>
The Disablement Income Group said in its report of autumn 1980:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is incredible that DIG's 15th Anniversary should be marked this November"</p></blockquote>
November 1980—
<br><blockquote><p>"by a real cut in the standard of living of some disabled people. It is incredible but, unfortunately, inescapably true." That was a 5 per cent. cut in the real benefits for disabled people of all kinds.</p></blockquote>
This is a modest contribution to a recognition of the needs of disabled people. The Government are jumping on to a 'bandwagon. To rub in what the Government's record is since May 1979 and how the disabled have been punished by the Government, the former Labour Cabinet Minister who deserted to the Tory Party said himself that the disabled should shoulder the burden of public expenditure cuts in equal proportion to the rest of the community. That is what he said and that is what they are doing.<br><br>
This proposal will not mean any extra expenditure by local government. That is why the hon Gentleman is supporting it. It will cost nothing. Fine words cost nothing, so he engages in fine words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, and as seems to be very suitable, it is the private developer who will have to pay more. If he is building a public building, I 'think that that is right.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why the hon Gentleman is supporting the amendment—because the cost is not coming out of the taxpayer's pocket. He thinks that all public expenditure, whether on the disabled or not, is bad. But if the private developer can shoulder the burden, that is all right. He can take that view if he likes, but let him not engage in humbug over a proposition like this.<br><br>
My hon Friend's amendment seeks to 'impose a duty. It has a mandatory element, sand it will be interesting Ito see whether the Government will support it. It puts a bit of strength into the Government's proposition.<br><br>
The Minister could say now that the Government are not stopping at this to help the disabled. Let him say now that he will lift forthwith the moratorium on those houses in Glenrothes as a gesture in this

International Year of Disabled People. It would cost a little public money, but what is wrong with that if it enables those 10 disabled people in Glenrothes to get into those houses a few months earlier? We are not so bankrupt as a nation as to stop that. Why does he not send a telegram now to Glenrothes corporation telling it to get on with those houses and get the people into them before the Royal wedding? It would be a nice gesture—a Royal wedding present to 10 wheelchair patients—to get them into their houses in Glenrothes in time for the wedding. A hell of a lot of money will be spent on that wedding —far more than it would cost to complete those 10 houses in Glenrothes. They are the priorities that we ought to be talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the real humbug.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is public expenditure. Nothing will 'be spared when that event takes place. Let no one pretend that we are short of cash. What is wrong are the priorities. We are discussing an element of priority for a minority group in the community. If we cannot provide additional money for them, God help us.<br><br>
I hope that my hon Friend will make sure that he gets a great deal of publicity for his efforts. He is to be congratulated on putting down the new clause. If he has incited—I think that "incited" is the word —the Government to act in the face of majority opinion in the House, he has done a worthwhile job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, and take up the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) on only one point. I think that he attributed the fact that the Government were bringing forward their own new clause to the fact that two Government Back Benchers had signed the new clause in the name of the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). He is attributing excessive power and influence to Back Benchers. The Government are genuinely concerned.<br><br>
As one of the signatories to the new clause of the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian, I commend his initiative in putting it down. The spirit of the original new clause reflected the spirit of the House as a whole. There is little that I wish to add to his speech, except to say—I am sure that all hon Members will agree—that it was well researched and informative. I do not wish to imply that other speeches made in the Committee are not well researched and informative. But the hon Member put an immense amount of work into that speech.<br><br>
The key point is whether the Government's proposed new clause is a genuine advance on existing legislation. I hope that, in rthis International Year of Disabled People, my hon Friend the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee that it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) on the mini-campaign he has run in the Committee on this important question. He said that he hoped that it would not be churlish to claim a little credit. My hon Friend has an agricultural background, but I had not thought of him as a churl.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
Hecertainly deserves a good deal of credit. He has had a response from both sides of the Committee. I am prepared to accept that there is good will and that Conservative hon Members are men of feeling on this matter.<br><br>
there has been a long and disappointing history in Scotland of access for the disabled to buildings. That would be common ground. I accept the point made by the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), that there is always a danger that phrases are put on the statute book which are open to a certain interpretation and indeed may appear to anyone of good sense and literacy to mean one thing, but then at the end of the day little happens and there is a feeling of anticlimax. I believe—and there has been copious reference to this—that section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 perhaps has fallen into that category.<br><br>
Having said that and accepted that that is a danger, I must add that it is an even greater danger if one gets oneself into the frame of mind where one says that that is a reason for doing nothing. I think that that is the danger—I put this no more strongly, and I do not mean it in any offensive sense—with which the hon Member flirted in his remarks. I believe that there is a level of cynicism about Parliament's ability to translate into action good intentions towards the disabled which is reaching dangerous proportions. There has been reference to the attempt by the hon Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) to promote a Private Member's Bill which was supported by a massive array of Back Benchers on both sides of the House but which was killed stone dead by one anonymous cry of "I object" on a Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the hon and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Sir R. Bell) who said it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, shame on him. In any event, it happened.<br><br>
I have had a fair amount of correspondence from people who are cynical, and rightly so, about the way in which we treat these matters. It is not just a question of the specific issue of the disabled. A major problem is developing about the way in which we treat all Private Members' legislation. We are getting very near to the point where anything of substantial content is almost certainly bound to fail. One has to go back into the 1960s before one finds any substantial achievement of Private Members' legislation.<br><br>
Therefore, I am anxious that we should not be seen to be expressing pious hopes and good intentions, even at the rather modest level at which this Committee operates in the political system. If we are to put legislation on to the statute book, it must be legislation which can be seen to have an impact upon the public. But it would be equally dangerous to shy away entirely from the problem just because it is difficult to find the right formula.<br><br>
I do not want to bore the Committee with examples; but in my own constituency I am under pressure—I will not say "great pressure", because that might suggest that in some way I resented the letters that I receive. There is a group of people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0914">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 715</span>
who, rightly, keep reminding me of the real difficulties which disabled people, people in wheelchairs, have to face.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon Member for Edinburgh, South is right to remind us that, although we are talking here about the possibility of giving local authorities powers to impose conditions on private developers, the public sector has been as much a sinner as the private sector in many ways. I can think, for example, of a long and tough fight that we have had in one of my principal community centres merely to have the doors widened so that wheelchairs can get into toilets. That fight went on month after month, probably for a couple of years, before it succeeded. I accept that local authorities have great difficulties in terms of finance at the moment—we all know the reason, which is that Government policy is making it more and more difficult, but I believe that some of them have shown a lack of enthusiasm about moving themselves in respect of their own public buildings.<br><br>
The example of British Rail has been much publicised, but it is worth reminding the Committee that countless millions have been spent. I cannot remember what the Clyde rail budget was, but it was substantial. The result has been some splendid new facilities, with absolutely no provision for the disabled in the new stations that have been built.<br><br>
Some Opposition Members—and I am sure that we had support from some Conservative Members —tried to put pressure on British Rail. There were meetings, questions in the House, and so on, but no response was forthcoming, apart from no doubt well-meant assurances that it was because of financial stringency and no lack of good will towards the problems of the disabled.<br><br>
So it is a widespread problem in the public as well as in the private sector. But we have here an opportunity to legislate. Thanks to the initiative of my hon Friend, we have before us a new clause.<br><br>
Without trying to apportion blame in terms of which particular statute was defective, I can say that there is plentiful evidence that local authorities feel that they are not properly equipped to deal with planning applications where there is an inadequacy of provision of access for the disabled. Clearly, section 4 of the 1970 Act has not had the proper effect. We have had letters from the Highland region read out, my hon Friend has been in touch with the Borders region, and, although I do not want to prejudice Conservative hon Members by mentioning it, we have also had letters from the lord provost of Dundee. They all make the same point. Whatever we may think of Dundee's policies generally, it is very much on the right side of the argument. They were unanimous in saying that, with the best will in the world, although one of them said that it had tried hard to improve accessibility, they had not been in a position to impose conditions on the developer.<br><br>
It surely is not beyond the wit of the drafting team available to the Minister to provide a form of words which clearly and appropriately in Scottish terms can slot into section 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 to allow a local authority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
to impose conditions where it thinks it practical and desirable to do so. That would give discretion to local authorities; we are not trying to tie them to a mandatory use of these powers. It would be up to local authorities to translate their good intentions, which they tell us are manifest, into action where appropriate.<br><br>
We have had some political jousting across the Committee, but we all pay lip service to the need to give discretion to the local authorities where appropriate. I can think of nowhere where it is more appropriate than in deciding what conditions they should impose on planning applications which they themselves have to process. I cannot see the essential difficulty about including in section 26 of the 1972 Act appropriate forms of words which will give the local authority that right and power. Then, if important developments were going ahead without proper provision, we can go to the local authorities and effectively kick them, if it should be necessary, saying "Look, we have given you the means to do something about this. You have always said you wanted to do it. Then why the hell hasn't it happened?"<br><br>
I accept that it is always more difficult when one is on the Government Benches rather than on the Opposition Benches, where it seems much simpler and one does not have to think of the knock-on effect, the public expenditure effect, or counter pressure groups which are perhaps subtly at work. But, having been as sympathetic as I can, I believe that the Government new clause has all the dangers that have been mentioned. It looks as though we are doing something to help the disabled when we are in fact doing very little indeed. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) put his finger on it when he said that he wanted to be satisfied that this was an absolute and important step forward.<br><br>
In section 4(1) of the 1970 Act we have something which looks quite specific:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any person undertaking the provision of any building or premises to which the public are to be admitted, whether on payment or otherwise, shall, in the means of access both to and within the building or premises, and in the parking facilities and sanitary conveniences to be available (if any), make provision, in so far as it is in the circumstances both practicable and reasonable, for the needs of members of the public visiting the building or premises who are disabled."</p></blockquote>
On the face of it that looks like a powerful statutory instruction, with a limited get-out clause in terms of reasonableness and practicality. But obviously it has not worked.<br><br>
If that has not worked, I cannot help thinking that the rather anodyne phraseology in the new clause is considerably worse. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In determining any application for planning permission … the planning authority shall ensure"</p></blockquote>
—at that point one feels quite hopeful, but then it drivels away to nothing
<br><blockquote><p>"that the applicant is aware of such duty."</p></blockquote>
Surely to goodness the applicant is aware of his duty under the Act. The trouble is that he is doing damn all about it.<br><br>
It is no good saying to the local authority officials who have been consulted or who have written to us. "We know that nothing more can be done to force them to put in reasonable access, but we are giving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0915">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 717</span>
you an exciting new power from the First Scottish Standing Committee. We are giving you the power to ensure that they know what they ought to do, and if they do not do it you still can do nothing about it." That does not seem to me to improve the lot of the local authority in terms of its wish to help the disabled. It certainly does nothing to help the disabled.<br><br>
If the Minister will not consider some improvement, I wonder whether it is worth putting the new clause as it stands on the statute book, because, following the arguments that have been used by the hon Member for Edinburgh, South, I believe that it might be positively counter-productive. It is such a weak, woolly and inexact statement of good intentions, with absolutely no punch and with no real grit to it.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Therefore, although I do not hold any particular brief for the form of words that has been put forward by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian—they are good, simple, straightforward words, and therefore I suspect that they are probably inadequate—I certainly feel very strongly, and I probably speak for all my hon Friends, that we have to have some input into the new clause on the lines laid out by my hon Friend to ensure that the local authority not only makes the developer aware, but has a power, if the developer does not react 'to his state of awareness, to say "What would be reasonable and practicable is the following, and if you are not going to do it, we will make that a condition of planning approval".<br><br>
That would be a substantial step forward. It would change the balance of power. It would put in an element of compulsion, but it is an area where I believe that an element of compulsion, properly applied, with reasonable and practicable criteria still in the statute, is thoroughly justified. We have been trying since 1970 to improve the situation and we have been manifestly failing.<br><br>
I have no doubt about the bona fides of the concern of the Minister and his hon Friends, but I appeal to him to have the courage of the convictions which I am crediting him with, and I ask him, if not to accept my hon Friend's amendment—I am sure that if the Under-Secretary were to say that he wanted to take the matter away and come up with a better draft, my!hon Friend would be delighted to seek to withdraw his amendment—at least to make a positive response and not to leave us with the new clause as it is, which I fear is a poor and pathetic thing and will be held up to mockery and derision if it is the sole product of the much-expressed concern of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak on the amendment but particularly on the new clause tabled by the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I too, wish to congratulate him. He shames many of us, myself included, because I cannot describe myself as being impartial on this matter.<br><br>
I hesitate to say this, because if will probably produce a reaction that I would not care for from the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 718</span>
(Mr. O'Neill), but I spent some time in a wheelchair and I have had some firsthand experience in recent months of navigating through difficult corridors. It was a salutary lesson to me.<br><br>
I had not intended speaking on this, because I feel that it is my heart rather than my head which is responding, which can often be dangerous. Nevertheless, I agreed with almost everything that the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said, until he got on to his favourite piece of humbug. I am sorry about that, because I thought that he was making a very good case until then.<br><br>
The hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian said much of what all of us would have wished to say. As recently as yesterday I was conducting a party of disabled RAF pilots round the House. They came from RAF Headley Court, where I spent some months. The Serjeant at Arms made special provisions so that I could get them into parts of the House that would have been difficult otherwise. I discovered lifts that I did not know existed, because I mistakenly tried to take some of the chaps in wheelchairs into lifts that were not wide enough. Then I found that there are lifts in this building that cater for the disabled. Before yesterday I did not know that they existed. This shows how important it is.<br><br>
When one stands for election anywhere—certainly in Perth and East Perthshire—there is no way in which one can get onto the platform for the count in a wheelchair without a hoist of some sort. I found that I was required to be at the count on my feet. As far as the RAF were concerned, I should have been in a wheelchair. This made it clear to me that we are not fully aware of the problems that people suffer, and that something must be done.<br><br>
Talking to those who are injured on a permanent basis—thankfully I was not—I find that they have a more practical approach to the problem than any of us. We approach it emotively; they approach it in a practical way. They are looking for a public awareness of their problem and an awareness that provisions must be made in buildings which, for the purpose of living normal lives, they are required to visit. I underline "for the purpose of living normal lives", because it is wrong to imagine that the disabled do not live normal lives, but there are places where they would never wish to go and other places where they would wish to go regularly. Where they are required to go regularly—one thinks of public libraries and places of that sort—there is no doubt there is a need for facilities. I hope that my hon Friend can confirm that the Government's new clause is practicable and will improve the lot of the disabled in practical terms.<br><br>
I do not wish to be associated with any kind of sham, nor do I wish to line up with the kind of humbug that comes from those who, for whatever emotive reasons, wish to use this matter as a political platform. It is much too serious and important to be used as a political platform. This is why I did not wish to speak on it, but I was provoked into speaking on it by some of the comments made by the hon Member for Fife, Central. We should all adopt a more realistic and practical approach in our everyday lives to making sure that those who are less able than we are are not disadvantaged to any great extent.<br><br>

I conclude by again congratulating the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian. He has done a splendid service to the House and to the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by echoing the remarks of my hon Friends the Members for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) and Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) in congratulating the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) on focusing the attention of the Committee on this important topic. I can only agree with everything that has been said about the extent to which the hon Gentleman has devoted himself to acquainting himself with the problem and the needs of the disabled in Scotland.<br><br>
This is a matter which hon Members on both sides of the Committee and the House have taken a considerable interest in for some years. The provisions of the 1970 Act were a tangible expression of the concern felt then about ensuring that the needs of chronically sick and disabled persons were properly met.<br><br>
I shall confine my remarks to the position in Scotland.<br><br>
I shall not comment on what may or may not be the position either south of the border or with respect to the Private Member's Bill currently before the House.<br><br>
The hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian drew attention to section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, and in particular to the duty on an applicant who is involved in the construction of a building to make access for the disabled
<br><blockquote><p>"so far as it is … practicable and reasonable".</p></blockquote>
Hon Members on both sides of the Committee, including my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) have pointed out that this phrase, which is perfectly sensible, gives an opportunity to developers to avoid their duty under the Act if they can plead that the provision of such access would not be reasonable or practicable.<br><br>
A civil remedy is available—although I would not want to make much of it—to seek in the courts to enforce the duty placed upon a developer and for the developer then to show that it was not reasonable or practicable for him to comply with his duty in the circumstances of the case in question. I am familiar with the difficulties that that involves and would not suggest that that in itself would be of major assistance. But the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian was also correct in saying that there is no formal enforcement machinery for section 4; that although it imposes a duty, it does not provide either for the local authority or for anyone else to add a formula procedure for enforcing this particular duty, even though there is the remedy in the civil courts.<br><br>
But this is not the only legislation that is relevant to this debate. The substance of my comments and my response to the hon Gentleman's proposals is essentially that, so far as the position in Scotland is concerned—I make no comments about elsewhere in the United Kingdom because I simply do not know—his amendment is unnecessary because of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972.<br><br>
Essentially the hon Gentleman's amendment seeks to enable local authorities to impose conditions that would provide access for the disabled as a condition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
of the Planning permission that was being granted by that local authority.<br><br>
I refer the Committee to the 1972 Act and in particular to section 26(1) where it says, and I quote the relevant parts of the section:
<br><blockquote><p>"where an application is made to a local planning authority for planning permission, that authority, in dealing with the application, shall have regard to the provisions of the development plan, so far as material to the application"</p></blockquote>
which is not relevant to this debate—
<br><blockquote><p>"and to any other material considerations and, subject to sections 38, 39, 68 and 75 to 78 of this Act, may grant planning permission, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as they think fit; or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"may refuse planning permission."</p></blockquote>
I have taken very great care over this because I am aware of the point of the various quotations that the hon Gentleman has made from various local authorities to which he has spoken. I am advised that the reference to "any other material considerations" not only refers to questions of access and obviously of egress from a building but will also enable, as suggested in section 26 (la) which refers to the imposition of:
<br><blockquote><p>"such conditions as they think fit",</p></blockquote>
a local authority at the present time under existing law, if it is satisfied that on planning grounds—and access clearly is a planning matter—that it would be appropriate to impose a condition which enabled access for the disabled, to impose such a condition.<br><br>
As with any other planning condition that a local authority imposes, it is obviously open to the applicant, if he thinks that it is unreasonable, to appeal to the Secretary of State in the same way as would be the case with any other planning condition that had been laid down by a local authority. But there is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of those who advise me on these matters, that in general terms the question of access to a building is clearly a legitimate planning consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'> The Under-Secretary is, as always, being helpful. To recap, am I right in thinking that at the moment, if any local authority which is examining an application for a planning development considers that no adequate access arrangements have been made for the disabled, it could then impose such a condition and, in doing so—assuming that it was reasonable and practicable—it would have the support, in principle at least, for using such a power of the Secretary of State for Scotland?<br><br>
My second question to the Under-Secretary at this stage is that I think that he will agree that, to have that power under the blanket phrase of "any other material considerations" perhaps means that it gets rather lost. If it is not necessary, why is there not some virtue in having a specific reference to access for the disabled of the kind mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) to draw the attention of local authorities to the fact that they have the specific power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the local authorities, as planning authorities, are entitled to impose any condition they think fit when they have received a planning application as long as that condition is based, and is entitled to be based, on planning considerations.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0917">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
The question of access to a building is clearly a matter affecting planning considerations.<br><br>
It may be—perhaps I am anticipating a point that hon Members wish to raise—that a planning authority cannot impose a condition but the applicant observes the terms of another Act which is not, strictly speaking, a planning Act. The 1970 Act is not a planning Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not for a moment suggesting that a local authority would be entitled under a planning Act to impose a condition which relates to a duty imposed under a non-planning Act. But that is not the point that I am putting to the hon Gentleman or to the Committee. What I am saying is that, even if the 1970 Act were not on the statute book, and if a local authority —here we are talking about the powers of the local authority—believes that access for the disabled to a building is a legitimate planning consideration, it can impose such conditions as it thinks fit to ensure that access is provided. Only if the applicant then appealed and it was felt to be an unreasonable condition in the circumstances—on exactly the same criteria as would, in any event, apply under the 1970 Act—would that be overruled.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I appreciate that the hon Gentleman has been given information by one or two planning officials to whom he has spoken and who do not seem to appreciate that they have this discretion. I was concerned when the hon Gentleman informed me of this because it suggests that there is some doubt about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like clarification on one point. I have been advised over my shoulder by the hon Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) that the Minister has just made an earth-shattering statement—that access is a planning consideration and can be considered as such. This apparently is new ground and I wonder if the Minister would like to say it again, more loudly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am making it abundantly clear that I am not commenting on what might be the legal position in England and Wales. I am simply referring to the terms of the 1972 Act. I am saying that if the local authority were dealing with access to a building, whether for the disabled or for the general public, it would be unusual to assume that it was not a legitimate planning consideration. Clearly, if there was inadequate access or egress, that would, apart from anything else, bring in considerations of fire and other emergencies. if the access was inadequate for the population as a whole, that would be a planning consideration and, if it were legitimate for the population as a whole, it must, in principle, apply equally to groups of the population who might be expected to use that building in reasonable circumstances.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman said that certain planning officials may not be aware of that. Perhaps they are not, but others certainly are. I have checked on this and I understand that Glasgow district council—I give it simply as an example—has on occasion imposed a condition requiring access for the disabled to an office
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
block in exactly the sort of circumstance to which hon Gentlemen have drawn attention. I understand that on that occasion it was not appealed against. The applicants simply accepted the condition and it was inserted into the building. But it is wrong to suggest that local authorities as a whole are not aware that they have such an opportunity.<br><br>
What may be creating the problem is that the officials to whom the hon Gentleman has spoken have correctly said that a local authority cannot impose as a planning condition a requirement that the 1970 Act, which is not a planning Act, be observed. That would not, technically speaking, be a planning consideration. But they seem to have overlooked the wide discretion that they have under section 26 of the 1972 Act to impose such conditions as they think fit, subject to the right of appeal by the applicant to the Secretary of State. As long as planning considerations were being dealt with, that would be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The longer I listen to the debate, the more I am convinced that it is, sad to say, all a con trick. Can the Minister say whether any planning appeals in the last year or five years have been the subject of any reference to provision for the disabled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very annoyed at what the hon Gentleman has suggested. It is disgraceful to suggest that it is a con trick. That implies that I am deliberately trying to deceive the Committee. I hope that he does not mean that and that he will withdraw it immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that in general terms I was satisfied that this is a con trick. No one so far, including the Minister, has said that my hon Friend's new clause or the one to which the Minister has not yet spoken, actually imposes any additional duties on a local authority. To that extent it is a con trick.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that respect the hon Gentleman is perfectly correct, that neither his hon Friend's new clause nor any of the other matters which the Committee is considering this morning impose any duties on a local authority. If that is all he was saying, there is no problem.—[Interruption.]—He can make that point to his hon Friend. We are very grateful for the hon Gentleman's intervention, which has not added very much—on this occasion unusually—to the debate.<br><br>
What we are concerned with are the legal rights of local authorities. At the moment local authorities, if they wish, on planning grounds, can in Scotland impose such a condition, subject to the right of the applicant to appeal to the Secretary of State. Glasgow district council has already done so. Because of the current uncertainty and doubt that the hon Gentleman has identified among a number of local authorities, I am happy to indicate to the Committee that we would be perfectly willing to consider issuing a circular to all Scottish local authorities reminding them that this is a facility available to them to use if they think fit. If there is doubt about the matter and they think that it is not available to them, I am perfectly content that they should be made aware of that. That is the situation so far as the law is concerned. It is in that context that we consider the amendment before the Committee. The hon Gentleman's amendment is, for the reasons I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0918">Image</span>

have indicated, unnecessary. So far as the Government new clause is concerned—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all respect, and I am not being difficult, what the Minister has said is that there is a general power under planning law to impose conditions about access. He very fairly said that the 1972 Act would not allow reference to the duties under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. Clearly the intention of the hon Member's amendment is that there should be specific powers to impose conditions in light of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. That may be a good or bad thing, but it is certainly not unnecessary because it is covered by the 1972 Act, in terms of his own argument. Will he address himself to that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially a technical point. If the hon Gentleman wishes the 1970 Act to be enforceable, that would really require amendment to the 1970 Act. What we are concerned with are the rights of a planning authority. The question is whether a planning authority at the moment can impose comparable conditions. That is a question of planning law, not a question of the 1970 Act. There may or may not be an argument for amending the 1970 Act, but when we are talking about the rights of a planning authority, the question is do they or do they not have such a right at the moment. If they do have one it is unnecessary to amend the law. If they did not have one, that might be a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we want to give planning authorities the power to enforce section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, surely this is the right place to insert the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we want to do is to ensure that planning authorities have the right, on planning grounds, to ensure that access to a building should include access to that building for the disabled, as a legitimate planning consideration when dealing with a planning application. That is what we are concerned with. We are dealing with a planning application that has been submitted to a local authority. It is being dealt with by the planning authority and the question is whether, under existing law, in considering planning applications—and they can take into account only planning considerations when making a decision on that matter—they are entitled to impose such a condition. My information to the Committee is that they are entitled to do that, even if a significant number of local authorities do not appear to be aware of that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Labour Members seem to suggest that if the Minister were to issue a circular covering access for disabled people, that would simply be a sop. May I urge him to make it absolutely clear that he will issue such a circular? If planning authorities are so minded to include such a condition, they would be more confident of doing so if, following a circular, they had the clear indication from the Scottish Office that if an appellant were to take an appeal simply on the matter of access for the disabled,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
every indication had already been given that the Scottish Office would be supporting—in that planning application—the provision of an access provision for the disabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly take the point that my hon Friend has made. I am willing to give serious consideration to the question of a circular to local authorities. If doubt presently exists among local authorities as to their entitlement, that is a matter which should be clarified. A circular would certainly achieve that objective.<br><br>
Some of the doubts have been caused because some of the local authorities have rightly seen that they cannot enforce the 1970 Act. They have not appreciated that under the planning Acts they have a wide discretion as long as they are imposing conditions on planning grounds.<br><br>
Turning to the Government's new clause, I accept that it does not impose an obligation—indeed, nor does the hon Gentleman's new clause—but it is an improvement that when an applicant is before the local authority he should be reminded of his duty under the 1970 Act. Although many will already be so aware, there is no harm in ensuring this in all cases. While the major developments may be undertaken by those who are familiar with the terms of the Act there are, undoubtedly, a large number of minor developments which are also important for the disabled where that might have been overlooked.<br><br>
I do not suggest that the Government's new clause itself is a major change because it is clearly not entitled to such a description. An important point for the concern of the Committee is whether conditions can be imposed by a local authority to deal with questions of access for the disabled, and I am advising the Committee that as far as Scotland is concerned that is a power which is available on planning grounds to a local authority under the 1972 Act. Therefore, no further change of law in that respect is necessary at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to speak again, Mr. Gourlay, so may I make one more last intervention to make my point to the Minister? I accept that under the 1972 Act there is a right on planning grounds to consider adequacy of access for anyone, presumably including the disabled. I would not dispute that. But there is a positive virtue in drawing attention to the statutory duty under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act and that is why the Minister has brought forward a new clause to make sure that people are aware of their duties under it. It seems, therefore, a logical continuation—and a much more adequate way of buttressing the powers of local authorities in this regard to ensure action—that instead of just making them aware, we should continue by saying that if they do not react satisfactorily to that knowledge then there should be a specific power within a local authority to impose conditions in the light of their duty under the 1970 Act. That seems an important change in quality from the assurances given by the Minister. At the moment I think that it is something that this Committee should insist on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon Gentleman. I hope that he will listen to my reason further as it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0919">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
genuine. Unfortunately it is a technical argument. Some hon Members may think it is a quibble about semantics, but I think that it is valid. I do not think it would be right to say that a planning authority when dealing with a planning application should impose as a condition a requirement of a non-planning stature. I do not see the logic of that. But I see a good argument for saying that many local authorities will wish to impose a planning condition when dealing with a planning application, the condition being that there should be access for the disabled. If that is something which is reasonable and practicable, and if not there would be grounds for an appeal in any event, that is a legitimate consideration from the point of view of a planning authority.<br><br>
We are not concerned with whether it is done under the 1970 Act or 1972 Act. The disabled will not lose much sleep either way. I hope that the hon Gentlemen are concerned with the substance, not with the appearance, of the matter. We are concerned that in practice a Scottish local authority can, if it wishes for planning reasons, require access for the disabled, and that where it would be reasonable and practicable to provide such access it should be able to make that a condition of granting planning application. I have said that not only can local authorities do that under the 1972 Act, but I have given an example of the Glasgow district council which has already done so in respect of an office block. I am not aware of any circumstance in Scotland where such a condition has ever been overruled or been shown to be invalid in any way. if there was evidence to the contrary that would alter the whole nature of the argument and discussion. If local authorities already have a power which the hon Gentleman wishes to give them, that suggests that the amendment is unnecessary. On that basis I invite him not to insist on his amendment.<br><br>
I concede that there is uncertainty and perhaps confusion in the minds of some planning officials in various parts of Scotland, although not throughout Scotland, and a circular may very well be desirable to clarify this matter once and for all. On that basis, I hope that the hon Gentleman will agree that the debate has been extremely valuable, because it has enabled the matter to be clarified in the way that it clearly needed to be clarified. Therefore, he has done a great service not only to the Committee, but to the whole subject. However, for the reasons that I have given, it is not necessary for the Committee to approve the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that we should be able to achieve such unanimity and consensus in the Committee that there would be no need for anyone to talk about voting. In principle we are agreed. I am still not entirely happy that what the Minister suggests will do anything practical. He is just amplifying through his new clause, unless we succeed in amending it, a piece of legislation that has already been seen to be ineffective. I am becoming increasingly aware during this sitting of the immense power of inertia in the Civil Service. One can almost see it flowing over and engulfing the Minister. Some of his arguments seemed to be basically about semantics and details.<br><br>
I am grateful to practically all those who have taken part in the debate for their contributions. I want to refer briefly to what the hon Members for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) and for Renfrewshire, East (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
Stewart) said. The hon Member for Edinburgh, South stressed the problem of whether access to a new development should be " practicable " or " reasonable ". The point that I would make is that at present the judgment whether something is " practicable " or " reasonable " lies with the developer. Through my amendment I seek to enable a planning authority to make that judgment and, where it is " practicable and reasonable ", impose it as a condition of planning permission.<br><br>
The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East summed up the whole debate in asking whether new clause 14 did anything. As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, all that it does is to make it mandatory that applicants for planning permission should be made aware of their unenforceable obligations under section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. I am not sure what good it does anyone to draw attention to a duty which people cannot be compelled under any circumstances to carry out. This is why it would be helpful to add the amendment at the end of the new clause, which, so far as it goes, is certainly helpful. The suggestion of a circular is also helpful.<br><br>
The amendment says
<br><blockquote><p>"and may impose conditions to ensure that such a duty is carried out".</p></blockquote>
Either it is a statutory duty or it is not. if it is, it is only reasonable that someone, somewhere should have the power to ensure that it is carried out. I suggest that we insert these words in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act to lay that discretion on planning authorities. Who better to do it, since they already handle the planning applications?<br><br>
There is still some confusion, which has been brought home to me by my discussions in the past few days with planning officers from all parts of Scotland. They feel that under the basic regulations which concern the determination of planning applications they can adopt criteria only in areas where a condition is necessary and reasonable and where it is not controllable under any other legislation. It has been made abundantly clear in the course of the debate that this law is controllable technically under other legislation, but no one can control it. It is like the proverbial Catch 22; no one will get anywhere. I am concerned that if we accept the new clause as presented by the Minister, we shall simply draw attention once again to the needs of disabled people without making any provision to ensure that their needs are met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman saying that the power does not exist? My understanding—certainly from my hon Friend the Minister and my own reading—is that the power exists but that it is not being used, because many people do not know that it is there. If that is so, surely the way to deal with the matter is by a circular reminding planning authorities that they have the power to impose conditions. Is the hon Gentleman saying that he disagrees with the Minister and that that power does not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My advice from planning officers is that they, having researched the matter in detail, feel that they do not have the power. In fact, it has been made perfectly clear in the course of the debate that power under section 4 of the Chronically
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0920">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
Sick and Disabled Persons Act does not exist. As it stands, it is a whitewash. The question must be whether this can work under the general authorities planning committees. We have evidence that in England—and in Wales certainly—these have been challenged, and that the inspectors at the inquiries have found against those who wanted to enforce the provisions of the Act.<br><br>
I think that we are after exactly the same thing. I should be prepared to seek to withdraw the amendment if the Minister would give a clear undertaking that he will look at the matter again between now and Report and that if he finds—as I suspect, and as I have been advised—that planning authorities cannot impose these conditions specifically tied to the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, he will bring in a further amendment on Report. if he is not prepared to give that undertaking, I shall have reluctantly to force the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have told the hon Gentleman that I entirely accept that local authorities cannot specifically enforce the 1970 Act. There is no dispute about that, and I suggested nothing to the contrary. But, although they may not be able to enforce that Act, under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972, they can impose such conditions as they think fit on planning grounds. That includes questions of access, as Glasgow district council has already shown. That is the basis on which I tell the hon Gentleman that his amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But those conditions can apparently be challenged on all kinds of general planning grounds which have nothing to do with the needs of disabled people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They can be challenged on exactly the same grounds as the hon Gentleman has proposed—that if it were reasonable and practicable the Secretary of State would overrule such a statutory condition. That is exactly what the hon Gentleman's amendment suggests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that we should reach this stage. I have listened carefully to what everyone has said and read over and over again new clause 14. It certainly needs strengthening. All that it does is to make applicants for planning permission aware of duties which everybody knows will not have to be carried out—and they have been seen to take advantage of the fact. The Minister's new clause does not take us very far. It needs to be beefed up. The form of words that I suggest tagging on to it may well be grammatically defective, and no doubt we could tidy it up on Report. But, in the circumstances, 1 feel that I must reluctantly press my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon Friend should reconsider that if the Minister is prepared to respond. I said that this was a con trick. We are getting in a tangle. The Minister has at least made clear to me—and my hon Friend has to some extent endorsed—that there is total confusion among the planning officers whom he has consulted as to their powers under existing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
legislation. A circular would not only be a useful way of drawing it to their attention but would give us all time between now and Report to find out exactly what is involved.<br><br>
I have had no representations, for instance, from DIG. I should have thought that we would have had some detailed comments on this. I mean no disrespect to my hon Friend, but to get a submission from the lord provost of Dundee—all credit to him—is not enough. I hope that that authority applies the planning considerations. This is the kind of research that is needed. In fairness to the Minister and to all of us, it would give us time to find out whether any authorities are using the planning powers that they rightly have, and to which the Minister has referred, to exercise their discretion.<br><br>
I must be quite clear about this. There is quite a responsibility. I do not have to hand the references in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 as to what buildings we are talking about. But I presume that it contains some reference to the size and kind of building to which even these recommendations should apply.<br><br>
It is difficult for a planning committee to decide what is reasonable. Suppose there are applications for two pubs, and one happens to be up a hill or three storeys up. This is where we are all dodging the issue. If there is any money involved, of course we are not prepared to insist on it. That is the honest approach to it, or the real approach at the moment.<br><br>
I am not unmindful of the responsibilities of planning authorities that have to exercise in good faith that kind of fairness, balance between one application and another. But, in the light of what has taken place this morning, I feel that there is certainly a need for clarification of the powers contained in the planning Act and indeed how they have been used and have operated.<br><br>
If I was provoked into saying that the whole thing was a con trick, I am not withdrawing that. I really want us, in the interests of disabled people, to use the next couple of months to find out exactly what is happening in Scotland. Nobody has produced any great evidence. In fairness, my hon Friend has not produced any, nor has the Minister. So a cooling-off period would do us all good until we find out what is actually happening in the world outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and to agree with virtually everything that he said. I am inclined to be convinced by what my hon Friend the Minister said.<br><br>
It is entirely up to the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) if he wishes to press his amendment to a Division. If, however, the amendment is lost here he cannot reintroduce it on Report. In the light of the debate and in consideration of the sympathy that he has from both sides, he may wish to reserve to himself the right to raise it on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be near agreement here. Will the Minister come some way towards my hon Friend's position? I am not satisfied with his arguments, unlike the hon Member for Renfrewshire East (Mr. Stewart), because I think that there may well be virtue in having
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0921">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
a plain statement of the right of a local authority to take cognisance of the 1970 Act when considering a planning application. I think that that would put it in a stronger and less ambiguous position than perhaps having to go to the somewhat bland "any other consideration" of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972.<br><br>
I am conscious that we want to get this right. We do not want symbolic votes here to try to force people into voting against matters which they would like in principle to be seen to be supporting. That would be unfortunate. There could be a conspiracy—perhaps "understanding" is a better way of putting it—between the two sides of the Committee that we let this matter rest at the moment, but that it will reappear on Report stage. It need not be a long debate; perhaps we could have a compact debate on agreed lines. We might be doing a service to the interest group which we are trying to help by leaving our options open at this stage for further consideration.<br><br>
I do not thing that that is an unreasonable point to make. If the Minister will go along with it, I shall urge my hon Friend not to press his amendment now.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I in no way dissent from what the hon Gentleman has just said. We shall obviously give consideration to the points that have been raised during the Committee stage, and the hon Gentleman will no doubt be able to discuss with those who advise him whether what I have said is acceptable as a statement of what is available to local authorities at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on whether anything is acceptable at this stage. I gather that there is no way in which I can reserve the right to raise this matter on Report, but I hope that we shall be able to do so, particularly in view of what has been said on both sides of the Committee. In view of the helpful remarks from both sides, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

I think that there is a developing consensus in the Committee, and I hope that it will continue during what I hope will be a short discussion on this new clause. When I made my original comments on the abuses, as I saw them, in twinning, I gave the total number of days' holiday by two lord provosts of Edinburgh as 121
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
days between March 1975 and 26 October 1979. That was 121 days in four and seven-twelfths years. But that figure has to be slightly corrected. It is in fact 128 days in that same period. Each of the two lord provosts on those occasions were accompanied by their wives on 13 of the 18 world jaunts that they engaged in.<br><br>
Between November 1976 and April 1977 the late Provost Miller had trips to Florence, Athens, Rome—twice, Munich and Nice and 19 days in New Zealand and Australia. Lord Provost Borthwick between August 1977 and October 1979 went to Helsinki, Seville, Munich—three separate visits, Malawi, the United States and Canada, Berlin—twice, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Australia, China, Florence and Nice, all the time taking £12 attendance allowance daily, plus his £5,500 a year for his services to Edinburgh. From 18 January to 15 February 1978, accompanying the lord provost to New Zealand, Hong Kong, Australia and China were the lady provost, the director of public relations and the city officer. If one looks at the 17 visits, one sees that not only the lord provost went, but his wife went on 13 occasions and others went.<br><br>
The total number of people on all those tours was 59. If one multiplies that 59 by the number of days, one finds that what I might call the man-day holidays amount not to the figure 1 gave but to 7,552 man-day holidays for these officials in Edinburgh in 55 months. That is not bad going. There is an undoubted abuse in this matter. I have discussed this in private with hon Gentlemen and they agree that it is a non-party matter. What I am about to say will not be very popular with some of my own colleagues in local government, but it needs to be said.<br><br>
I had a letter from a retired person in A lloa,
<br><blockquote><p>"Scots born of Scottish parents",</p></blockquote>
who writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"the situation is becoming ridiculous at a time when there is no money to spare for home helps, aid to disabled, etc. etc."</p></blockquote>
She then quotes some Labour councillors on a
<br><blockquote><p>"jolly jaunt to San Francisco"</p></blockquote>
and goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"it should be noted that about a year ago a Strathclyde rep was set up at colossal expense in San Francisco and is still there finding jobs."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether that is true, but if it is it is an absolute scandal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend's enthusiastic attack on the local authority's expenditure is remarkable, but will he accept that the San Francisco trip was in connection with the industrial promotion of Glasgow? The gentleman in San Francisco is there to attract more investment. One may argue how cost-effective this kind of exercise is, but it certainly was not a jolly jaunt; it was with serious intent. It was thought to be useful, and in these circumstances it clearly falls within the legitimate discretion of the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just quoting what irate taxpayers and ratepayers are saying about these trips. Undoubtedly some visits are well-intentioned and worth while, but some of those of the two lord provosts cannot be defended by anyone in his right senses.<br><br>
These are the minutes from the Edinburgh council regarding the purpose of the visit. The resaons given
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0922">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
for the visits in 1977 to Florence, Athens and Rome were:
<br><blockquote><p>"Invitation from the Mayor to visit Athens for three days prior to visiting Florence."</p></blockquote>
The minutes go on to justify the visit to Rome:
<br><blockquote><p>"Invitation from the Mayor to visit Rome for two days following the visit to Florence."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon Gentleman to advise the Committee whether those towns are officially twinned with Edinburgh, because visits to places other than towns which are twinned are not relevant to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You forestalled me by 10 seconds, Mr. Gourlay. At that time Edinburgh was twinned with San Diego in California, Dunedin in New Zealand, Nice in France, Vancouver in Canada, Munich, Berlin and Florence. This is one of the reasons why I put down my new clause. I should like to quote from a Labour supporter, a well-wisher from Leith:
<br><blockquote><p>"I wish to draw your attention to the number of excursions our Labour Councillors have taken—to Nice, America to give Jack Nicklaus his putter, and the proposed visit to San Diego, Texas and Houston."</p></blockquote>
Whilst Edinburgh was twinned with all these salubrious resorts, Dundee has settled for Nablus on the West Bank. God knows what the advantage is in twinning with a place like that.<br><br>
There is undoubtedly an abuse going on, and my new clause tries to deal with it. There are three propositions in it. It is very clear, because it was written by me and is not legalistic in any sense. I propose that twinning by any town or authority in Scotland shall be allowed with only one town, city or place; that £5,000 per year shall be the maximum allowed for visits; and that the overall safeguard shall be that all arrangements should be approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
If the first proposition were accepted, at least it would eliminate many of these jaunts. Edinburgh would have to choose between San Diego and Dunedin, but it could not have all the other places—Vancouver, Munich, Florence and the rest.<br><br>
If proposition 2 were accepted, proposition 1 would be unnecessary, because if one put a financial limit on the overall amount that would control the number of excursions to anywhere in the world.<br><br>
The final arbiter, which is probably the most effective proposition, should be in all instances the Secretary of State for Scotland. I have talked to Willie Ross—now Lord Ross of Marnock—and to my right hon Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). Both served as Secretary of State, and both have told me that they exercised control in one way or another, although they were vague about how it was done. They clearly thought that there was abuse and took powers. I do not know whether they exercised them or whether the threat was enough. They realised that there was a problem to be dealt with.<br><br>
I do not say that the sums of money involved are large, but the irritation and anger caused to ordinary ratepayers who are struggling with increasing rate bills and taxes is out of all proportion to the sums involved. I hope the Minister will make some noises about whether he will attempt to deal with it, even by a circular warning them that there is a lot of dis
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
satisfaction and irritation about this abuse, and unless they do something about it, he is prepared to act himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether a statutory control on twinning is appropriate, I consider that the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has a point. We have had to regard his narrative of Edinburgh with an embarrassment somewhat akin to that which he experienced when, during our last sitting, we considered the activities of Kirkcaldy district council.<br><br>
For some 12 years I have paid rates in Edinburgh, and until the hon Minister raised the twinning arrangements that that fair city has, I was not aware of the great international links that I enjoyed as a ratepayer. Perhaps it is my own fault that I am so lamentably ignorant of this, but I am sceptical about whether these vital international links benefited the city as a whole, or its commercial and business interests. Although it was expensive, it was probably harmless, but the case of Dundee district council, twinning with Nablus, has probably done positive harm to the city. It could certainly have done little to help solve problems in the Middle East. Although I share his views on the expensive arrangements that some local authorities have made in twinning, I hope that he will be prepared to make it clear that the twinning ideal is one that deserves to be encouraged where smaller communities are involved.<br><br>
In my own constituency the borough of Kirriemuir has been twinned with a little town in the Auvergne in France called Volvic. The relationship has been extremely successful and, I would consider, of genuine benefit to both communities. Every year schoolchildren from Kirriemuir go to France and this Easter there will be schoolchildren coming back. This year even the fire departments of the two towns are to have holidays at each other's expense. It causes some anxiety to contemplate what happens in one place when the others are visiting. The point of this is that not only are international links forged with children and their parents, but no expense is involved to other ratepayers.<br><br>
While the hon Gentleman has a point in drawing attention to the abuses that have undoubtedly existed, I hope that in summing up he will make it clear that he is not wholly against the principle of twinning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The terms in which the new clause is couched indicate that, I hope, I am not ruling out twinning; I am simply saying that it ought to be under some control and accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has done the Committee a service in bringing this new clause forward, because there is no doubt that the object of twinning is often forgotten or lost because it becomes just a series of expensive junketings. Twinning is supposed to help and improve international understanding. Sadly, in recent times twinning has sometimes become a kind of political exercise. The people of Dundee find it difficult to understand quite what the object of the Nablus twinning was. Indeed, many

people in my constituency who live in Invergowrie and Longforgan have written to me about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman tell us how it is possible to improve international understanding without getting involved in politics?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's intervention will show clearly just where he stands on this matter. It also shows clearly that he is not willing to listen to the other point of view. I will continue, if I may.<br><br>
It is inevitable that there will always be an element of political impingement in these matters, but when it is used blatantly as a political exercise, when the public at large are hostile to the expense incurred, there are no advantages; in fact, there are decided disadvantages. I would go as far as to say that the people in my constituency living in Longforgan and Invergowrie have no wish to be part of Dundee. So, they start off from a position of disadvantage. They already have an objection, and then they see the district council indulging in an exercise of this kind. One ought not to be surprised if they then adopt what can only be described as an unhelpful and, in some cases, hostile attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman keeps telling us that he has this great interest in the affairs of Dundee district council. Just for the record, could he tell us how many constituents are actually in Invergowrie and Longforgan, and how many have made representations to him on this? May 1 remind him that it was a Conservative Government, in spite of the wishes of his predecessor, that kept them in Dundee district council in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are about 5,000 electors there. I believe that that is a substantial number—a big enough number for me to be caring about their interests. I have had representations from about 35 in total. I would think that with 35 out of that number any hon Member would be concerned. if one receives 35 letters from one housing estate anywhere—and there are housing estates with that many people in them—one will be concerned that there is something far wrong in that area, and there is.<br><br>
I am deeply concerned, because I believe in twinning. I believe that the best way to get an understanding is to understand the other chap's point of view. My only concern is that the ratepayers must believe that they are getting value for the money that is being spent.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central made the point that if he was living in Edinburgh he would wonder whether he was getting value for the amount of money that was spent. I would say that where genuine benefits flow, and where the charge on public funds is not seen to be excessive, or, better still, where there is virtually no charge on public funds, then, of course, we should encourage twinning as much as possible. If that is so, if we cannot introduce this clause into the Bill because we are told that it is not practical or possible, I hope that the message of this debate will go out to the country, to show that we care about how the ratepayers' funds are spent and try to take a genuine interest, in the hope that we can improve international relations, but only at a price that the ratepayers are prepared to meet.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This short debate has been of interest and of some importance in that it has highlighted a concern that is expressed by many people in the wider community. The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) referred to the number of twinnings that the city of Edinburgh has. Indeed, Edinburgh and Dundee seem to be at the head of the Scottish league. Dundee, I understand, is twinned with five towns; Nablus does not have the sole distinction of its links with Dundee.<br><br>
The United Kingdom record appears to be held by Coventry, which is twinned with 19 other places. It would appear that the expression " being sent to Coventry " has a meaning slightly different in this context than it normally has. I think that Edinburgh has about six and Dundee five, so compared with Coventry they are amateurs.<br><br>
Having said, that, I would not wish to treat this issue in a trivial way. It is important when contacts are made between Scottish towns or local authorities and local authorities elsewhere that this happens only when there is an obvious benefit to the community. I certainly agree with the observation that these twinnings should be kept to a reasonable number and should not develop in the way that some hon Members have suggested.<br><br>
The advice that is given to local authorities by the local authority organisations is exactly the right advice. The Joint Twinning Committee, which represents all the British local authorities throughout the United Kingdom, has recommended:
<br><blockquote><p>"Care should be taken to see that any visits funded from public funds have a sound purpose, that the results will be beneficial to the community, that the purpose is understood by the community and that there is wide local support, and that they are made only by those who are interested in them or promote the twinning."</p></blockquote>
Undoubtedly there have been a number of examples in Scotland where it has been difficult to argue that these criteria have been met.<br><br>
I do not think that the Committee would seriously believe that legislation was appropriate to deal with this matter. It is really something which must be dealt with at the local level. But I hope that this debate will have served to make clear to the local authorities in Scotland that they should take the advice given to them by their own local authority organisation and ensure that they do not abuse what would otherwise be a very viable form of international contact and good will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee any longer in view of what the Minister has said. I hope that the local authorities will take notice of it and will obey the spirit of what is laid down by their own organisation.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

COMMUNITY COUNCILS</div> <!-- title -->

<p>'Local authorities and public authorities shall be obliged to give due consideration to, and to respond to, representations made by community councils in the exercise of their general purpose as defined in this section.'.".</p>
<p>[<i>Mr. Home Robertson</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
Section 51 (2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the general purpose of a community council shall be to ascertain, co-ordinate and express to the local authorities for its area, and to public authorities, the views of the community which it represents, in relation to matters for which those authorities are responsible, and to take such action in the interests of that community as appears to it to be expedient and practicable."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me and to many community councils that that simply gives community councils, the democratically-elected bodies, statutory bodies, the right to be heard by deaf ears in many parts of Scotland. That point has been forcibly made on a number of occasions, I dare say, to a number of hon Members. In particular, I gather that a number of community councils also made representations to the Stodart committee, which reported recently. Paragraph 254 of the committee's report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We detected in the evidence from community councils a good deal of frustration about their lack of powers, and the scant attention which was paid to their views by regional and district councils."</p></blockquote>
I have no doubt that the same would apply to a number of other public bodies.<br><br>
The clause would ensure that if a local authority, the electricity board or anybody else were to receive representations from a community council, exercising its statutory right to convey the opinion of the community which it represents, at least those representations would be taken into account and responded to. At present, they can be treated with complete contempt, and often are, and be flung into the wastepaper basket.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is making a serious allegation. Does he have knowledge of community councils that make representations to district or regional authorities and do not get even an acknowledgment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could go on at length on this subject, but it would not be appropriate to do so, because the Committee is anxious to make haste.<br><br>
I simply make the point that this is a serious problem, which has been drawn to my attention and that of the Stodart committee. I am concerned that, for instance, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, when community councils were first set up, indicated that it was not prepared to deal with representations from them and simply referred them to the electricity consumer council.<br><br>
Often community councils receive good co-operation from local authorities and indeed from Members of Parliament. Late on Tuesday night I moved a new clause concerning public transport in rural areas, as a direct result of representations made by community councils. The system can work, but there is evidence that the opinions and representations of community councils are not being given the consideration due to democratically elected councils set up under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The new clause would make it mandatory on public authorities at least to take into account and to respond to representa
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
tions made by community councils, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister to give critical consideration to the new clause. We do not want to make a big issue of it, but outside cities community councils have a status which we urban politicians do not always appreciate. Certainly in small communities which no longer have burgh status these bodies have been able to achieve some respect. Unfortunately, they are not always accorded similar respect by other authorities. I have found, for instance, that in my own constituency in negotiations and communications between these bodies and such bodies as the Scottish telecommunications board on the question of post offices or telephone boxes there are often problems that the public authorities do not give adequate credence to the often legitimate and highly specialised claims of the community councils.<br><br>
I am not aware of the scant attention being granted to the community councils that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) suggests. But it would do no harm to beef up the legislation and to give some point to it in the way suggested in the new clause. It would give some support to the lowest form of living democracy in Scotland. I say that in a purely hierarchical sense. These people, who are not paid attendance allowances but who give up their time, are becoming in some instances frustrated by the neglect—or apparent neglect—by public bodies. We should give a vote of confidence to community councils if we accepted the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what giving due consideration to the lowest form of democracy would amount to, but it was an interesting phrase that the hon Gentleman used.<br><br>
May I make three points. First, there is no widespread evidence of community councils finding their representations treated with utter contempt. No doubt it may have happened in certain areas, but community councils often seem to feel that because their views are not accepted by the local authorities they are being treated with contempt or ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And by public authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful to avoid the suggestion that, simply because a community council's views are not accepted, it means that they have been ignored. It is not true in that case, any more than it would be in any other area of similar representation.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon Gentleman's new clause would not make any difference to a local authority determined to ignore a community council. It would be entirely up to the local authority to decide what was and what was not due consideration. If it thought that the community council was, to use the words of his hon Friend, the lowest form of democratic life, it might feel that due consideration did not require it to spend much time on it.<br><br>
The third point, and perhaps the most important, which the hon Gentleman will enjoy reading about, even if he cannot respond to it directly, is that the amendment would give to community councils a right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0925">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
that local authorities themselves do not have. Local authorities have no right to insist that their representations will be given due consideration, by other local authorities or by public bodies, such as the SSEB, or anybody else. It would be curious and anomalous if local authorities were to find that community councils in this respect had greater statutory powers than the local authorities or other public bodies.<br><br>
On these grounds, while I can understand the hon Gentleman's feelings on the matter, and while I cannot in the circumstances expect him to seek to withdraw his amendment, I hope that it need not involve a Division.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I have exactly a signed mandate. The clause was tabled by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who has been cruelly kidnapped by the Whips on the Committee considering the Forestry Bill. I think that it was his intention to draw attention legitimately to the need for local authorities to take community councils seriously, and I am sure that he would be happy if it were negatived at this stage. I do not feel competent to seek to withdraw it on his behalf.</span></p>

FIRE ESCAPES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPANCY PROPERTIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"Subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may by order make, a local authority shall make a grant in respect of work for the provision of a means of escape from fire from a building which, or a part of which, is let in lodgings.".—</p>
<p>[<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
We now come to the last two new clauses. The fact that they are at the end does not mean that they are unimportant. Both raise substantial matters. I am glad that we shall have a few minutes—and I think that with your indulgence, Mr. Gourlay, we may even have a few minutes after one o'clock if necessary—to discuss them.<br><br>
Like new clause 13—I make no bones about it—this new amendment is tabled as a result of representations that were made very energetically to me and to some of my hon Firends, and I suspect to the Minister, by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, an organisation with a great deal of expertise in this field. I believe—and I speak with some knowledge of the matter—that it does a great deal of very useful work.<br><br>
The problem of fire escapes in multiple occupancy properties is simply that in Scotland they often do not exist. That is clearly unsatisfactory. They are often extremely expensive, and at the moment, as I understand Scottish legislation, there is no provision for help in the provision of fire escape mechanism which can be given by a local authority. It has been put to me that there is no designation under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and hostels or multi-occupancy properties are not presently treated as residential accommodation under the various social work Acts. Therefore, they are left to some extent in limbo.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
I do not want to over-dramatise. I am not suggesting necessarily that we are staring tragedy in the face, but there is no doubt that there are a large number of hostels and multiple occupancy houses which were built in Victorian times and there can be considerable dangers arising from that. I have here a letter from Mr. Laurie Naumann, the Director of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, in which he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Here in Edinburgh, for example, there are two establishments in which the sleeping quarters are made up of wooden cubicles and which can be described as 'tinder boxes'. The only fire precautions in one of the hostels, which until recently accommodated over two hundred men, were sand and water buckets and fire doors."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to point out that, as I am sure is true, those who operate premises like that often would very much like to see improvements, but it is totally impractical, given their financial resources. He tells me:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fife's last hostel for the single homeless"—</p></blockquote>
no doubt my hon Friend will be aware of this—closed in 1977
<br><blockquote><p>"because the owners could not afford the improvements required by the fire officer.".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the previous year, in 1976, an Edinburgh hospital had to close a dormitory of 30 beds for exactly the same reason.<br><br>
We need an expansion of hostel provision—I think that will be common ground—as soon as the financial climate allows it. Hostels are being provided very often in the private sector, but the fire precautions are unsatisfactory, as those who operate and manage those hostels know, but there is no way in which help can be given. Some may say "So what? There are many people who have to struggle with fire precautions without State assistance". But what is salt in the wounds, understandably, is that there is provision for local authorities to give assistance in these circumstances under English legislation, so that hostels south of the border are placed at a considerable advantage.<br><br>
Schedule 12 of the Housing Act 1980 contains in paragraphs 16 and 17 provision for mandatory special grants. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In so far as such an application relates to the provision of means of escape from fire, the authority shall not refuse it if it is duly made and the authority are satisfied that the relevant works are necessary for compliance with … a notice under Schedule 24 to the Housing Act 1980."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps for the sake of completeness one should go to schedule 24, which deals with:
<br><blockquote><p>"Houses in Multiple Occupation: Means of Escape from Fire".</p></blockquote>
Under schedules 12 and 24 there is a mandatory duty in certain circumstances on local authorities in England to give assistance and grants. I have been told that the grant in England is 75 per cent. of the work, to a maximum of £6,750, or £9,000 in London.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment in circular 21/80 recommended that the grants should cover
<br><blockquote><p>"Works needed for constructing the means of escape and for securing that it can be safely and effectively used."</p></blockquote>
That is a considerable help to those who are operating hostels of this kind south of the border.<br><br>
I recognise that even a £6,750 grant is often quite a small sum against the cost of, say, putting in outside fire escapes, but that help should be available to people who are trying to provide this very valuable facility in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
Scotland. It is as an appeal for this that the new clause has been put down.<br><br>
This matter came up in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill, and in particular in the debates in the House of Lords, where those two formidable heavies, Lord Mackie of Benshie and Lord Ross of Marnock, made attempts to introduce legislation to cover Scotland, but in vain. Powers were given for local government to help under section 69 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and certain housing legislation. That help has not been given. That kind of wide permissive power is very different from the specific, defined circumstances in which mandatory grants have to be given under English legislation. I do not believe that those general enabling powers are an adequate substitute for the English statutory provision. I hope that the Minister will take that point on board.<br><br>
Subsequent to efforts made on the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Bill, there was some correspondence. Mr. Alexander Murray, chairman of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless wrote to Lord Mansfield, one of the Minister's colleagues in the Scottish team. He received a reply from Mr. Alan Fraser, the private secretary. It dealt with a number of points, with which I will not weary the Committee, but I should like to road the last paragraph, 'because I think that it is very relevant:
<br><blockquote><p>"The question of grants to hostels and lodging houses for improvements in fire prevention facilities is complex in view of the acknowledged difference in registration arrangements for these buildings in Scotland as compared with England and Wales and you will realise that matters of this degree of difficulty cannot ordinarily be introduced at so late a stage of a Bill's Parliamentary consideration. The Scottish Development Department is giving urgent consideration to this and other aspects of houses in multiple occupation with a view to identifying the future action which should be taken in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Fraser was perhaps making a fair point that to pop it in at a late stage of that Bill was perhaps trying to take advantage of the Scottish Office and catch it unprepared. But he made it very clear that urgent consideration was being given to the problem.<br><br>
We have now 'moved on a considerable period of time, with fresh legislation which I should have thought was ideally suited to dealing with this point. The Minister may not feel able to accept the wording of the new clause, because 'it may not be the 'best way of achieving the objective, but I hope that he will come up with some positive results from the urgent consideration that was being given to the matter by Lord Mansfield and his colleagues. I hope that he will be able to indicate 'that those who operate hostels and multiple occupancy accommodation in Scotland are to be given this measure of support, and are to be helped, as their English counterparts have been since the 1980 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the time, I do not wish to detain the Committee. I just want to associate myself with what the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has said about this problem. I believe that it is a real one and one that requires to be investigated carefully by the Scottish Office.<br><br>
As the hon Member said, when we were debating the Committee stage of the Tenants, Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 it was recognised on both sides
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
of the Committee that there would in future be considerable problems of the single homeless in Scotland. The facilities that exist at present are not as good as they ought to be, and we want to do all that we can to improve them. I 'associate myself with what the hon Gentleman has said, and hope that my hon Friend the Minister will bear in mind that 'the concern on this matter is felt on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was gratified to receive the correspondence of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, partly because Laurie Naumann is from Fife—he comes from Kinghorn—and it is very encouraging to find that there is somebody outside who is interested in what we do in this Committee. He made valiant attempts to keep the hostel in Lochgelly open. The Minister may recall that it had a long history. It was run by a dedicated family as a private non-profit-making organisation for single homeless men. Between us we made a valiant attempt to keep it open. Finally it had to close some time ago, because the family could not bring the fire provisions up to the standard required by the local fire authorities.<br><br>
Laurie Naumann brought in a university research organisation that was interested in these matters, and as far I know it is still working, vetting the way in which the people who were thrown out of accommodation in that hostel found accommodation privately, through the local authority. Glenrothes development corporation co-operated to house one or two of them, and it was a heartening example of the way in which voluntary organisations could help resolve the problem where the Government were failing to do so.<br><br>
My hon Friend has drawn attention to the fact that the English provisions are much more generous than ours, though I gather from Laurie Naumann that he thinks that the Government made 'sympathetic noises when the Tenant's Rights, Etc. (Scotian) Act 1980 was being debated in Committee. I was not on that Committee, so I am unable to say whether that is accurate. The English law seems to be more generous in this matter than the Scottish law, and since the Government are, I think, anxious to bring Scottish law up to the levels of English law where it is known to be less generous, I hope that the Minister will make some appropriate compassionate noises.<br><br>
I say that particularly since Mr. Naumann in his letter makes the point that successive surveys have shown that not only is there a greater proportion of the population in Scotland in this kind of accommodation—not only single men and women, but also mentally retarded people, offenders, old people and so on—but the accommodation generally is of a much poorer quality than it is in England and Wales. For all these reasons, I think that a gesture, particularly at this late stage, would be a nice wind-up to what is otherwise an obnoxious Bill.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by paying credit to the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, and in particular to the work done by Mr. Naumann, whom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0927">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
I have met on a number of occasions. He has done a great deal for this group, which is one that does not receive much attention from the media and public bodies. His work has been extremely valuable.<br><br>
I think that I can give some reassurance to the Committee. The matter was raised some months ago, and following the passage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, a review of the whole question of multiple occupation was initiated by the Scottish Development Department. That review is going on now, and the work is expected to be completed some time later this year. It covers not only the question of fire escapes but standard amenities and a number of other matters of importance to properties involving multiple occupation of the kind referred to in the clause.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman is correct in saying that the statutory position in Scotland is less favourable than that south of the border, for various historical reasons. It is appropriate that consideration should be given to remedying this discrepancy. We hope that the review now in progress will come to a conclusion around October this year. It will almost certainly be necessary to consider some legislative change to the existing situation in the light of the recommendations that will be made.<br><br>
The matter is complex, because the area in which change may require to he initiated covers a number of different issues in respect of the single homeless. A considerable quantity of legislation, in terms of the number of clauses concerned, may ultimately be required. All that I can tell the hon Gentleman is that it is the Government's intention, once the review has been completed, to consider appropriate legislative means of implementing the changes considered desirable in the light of the review. At this stage it is premature to pronounce upon it, but the matter is actively in hand, and the Government will try to initiate action once the review has been completed and the recommendations have been considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister says. From a cursory look at the subject, I recognise that the legislation may have to be fairly complex. There are many cross-references in statutory terms to be picked up and knitted into a coherent whole. Plainly this will be a lengthy process. If the review is completed in October, I fear that it may be a long time after that before the legislation can be put together and then before it can find a slot in the queue. With no conspiracy involved, we may be looking at a time scale of two or three years in practical terms before we obtain the legislation we need.<br><br>
In the interim a significant number of cases may arise in which important units in our over-thin provision of hostel accommodation are threatened by problems over fire precautions and fire escape provision. Is there any way in which in the interim the Minister could ensure that a sympathetic look is given to these individual cases, to ensure that we do not have the kind of event that apparently happened in Fife, where substantial facilities just dropped out of existence because of the problem dealt with in the new clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give consideration to whether
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
there are means of making interim improvements. Clearly, one would not wish to change the legislative position until the review was completed. I know that hon Gentlemen appreciate that. But I shall certainly consider the point raised by the hon Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a short debate, but in view of what the Minister has said there is no point in prolonging it. I shall certainly not force the issue to a Division. It was a stratagem for raising the matter and reminding the Minister of the importance and urgency that we attach to the subject.<br><br>
I hope that the hon Gentleman's final remarks, about considering the interim possibilities, will be taken seriously. If he will let me know his thoughts later it will be helpful, because I know from personal experience in my own constituency, and from experience before I returned to the House of Commons, that the shortage of hostel accommodation is chronic and at times reaches crisis dimensions. It would be a tragedy if there were a significant diminution in the number of places available due to this lack in the statutes, which has meant that managers and operators of such accommodation cannot reach the requirements which the fire authorities, I am sure very properly, insist on.<br><br>
In seeking to withdraw the motion, I hope that this review will be pushed ahead energetically and that we will be kept in touch with what is happening, and, secondly, that legislation will follow as quickly as is practical and in the interim the Minister will take seriously the undertaking he has given. With those remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

RATING OF HOSTELS AND LODGING HOUSES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"Any building offering hostel or lodging accommodation and operated either for charitable purposes or on a nonprofit making basis shall be treated for the purpose of the valuation or revaluation of lands and heritages as a dwelling house in terms of section 6 of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956.".</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This is the very last of this Committee stage, though, of course, not the last of the Bill, which still has to go to Report and then to another place, so it will no doubt haunt our dreams for some time.<br><br>
We come to the ratings of hostels and lodging houses—again a point raised by the Council for Single Homeless, as I have indicated. It is a rather more complicated position, and it is one where unashamedly I want some information as well as help from the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
The position as I understand it is that a house which is in multiple occupancy is presently not classed as domestic for rating purposes. It is seen as that rather strange category of non-industrial; it is neither fish, flesh nor fowl. It is non-industrial, but it is not taken as commercial and it is not taken

as domestic. It appears—I put it no higher than that —that as a result of this there has been a considerable difficulty for those who operate or own such accommodation because they are paying a considerably higher rate bill—their rate assessment is higher—than if they had been treated purely as domestic accommodation.<br><br>
I give a practical example. Again, I am indebted to the Council for Single Homeless for this. I am told that the council knows, for example, of a charitable organisation in Edinburgh. I should underline that many of these organisations are charitable; we are not talking about people who are trying to make money out of the single homeless. A charitable organisation in Edinburgh sold a hostel for young people in order to purchase two flats in which former hostel residents could live and look after themselves. That is a positive and constructive development, Mr. Naumann remarks in his letter, and I agree.<br><br>
The flats were in different tenements and each normally accommodated four young people. They did not involve staff. When the charity made an appeal to the local authority for the 50 per cent, rate rebate which went with their charitable status this alerted the assessor to the fact that the flats were being used as hostels, although very small hostels with a settled number of residents. As a result, the flats were then reassessed as non-domestic, and the ratable value went up from £172 to £467. Even with the 50 per cent. derating, the result was that the rates which had to be paid went up from £167 to £248. That would not have happened if these flats, which were in this case individual flats with a very small number of residents, had been treated as domestic. It would have meant a considerable saving for the people concerned.<br><br>
I give just another example of a larger unit. The housing association in Edinburgh, again, rehabilitated a tenement block to contain 15 'bed-sitting rooms with shared facilities and 24 independent flatlets. The 15 bed-sits were 'treated as one multiple occupied unit and the result was a rate bill of £7,000 even after the 50 per cent. relief, while the 24 individual flats were treated as domestic and their total rate bill was approximately £6,000. So, for the 15 bedsits, even with 50 per cent. derating, it was £7,000 and for the 24 individual flats it was £6,000 in total because they were treated as domestic and, therefore, were given a much lower valuation.<br><br>
I am attempting to say that where we have hostels and lodging houses it seems that they should be rated as domestic. They are seldom businesses in the normally accepted sense, but often are the settled home of the rest of the people who will live in them for a lengthy period. This again is an area of development which we all want to encourage, and a marginal, perhaps, but an important financial advantage of being treated as domestic should be extended to them. That is the simple purpose of this new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear to the Committee that I was prepared to use my discretion to extend the sitting for a few minutes, but I must get to the question on reporting of the dole before 1.15 pm.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again I hope to be very short in my reply. It was a generous tribute by the Minister to Mr. Laurie Naumann. His contribution to the previous new clause and this one are very well merited. It is important to get the problem of the rating of facilities being offered for the homeless sorted out. There may be some doubt as to whether a statutory change is required. It is certainly a problem. It is important in view of the problem of the single homeless in Scotland that the changes in hostel provision away from crude dormitories, or rather clumsy cubicles with shared common facilities are very much desired. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain to the Committee that either he will accept this kind of change or reassure us that there is another remedy open to those people who are running those very worthwhile institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly the case that the problem to which Mr. Naumann has drawn our attention has certain anomalies. We are of course dealing with a very complicated area of the assessor's role in determining the value of the property. It is always a matter which can seem rather arbitrary, being based as it is on the rather obscure principles of violation of law. My hon Friend said there may be some doubt as to the statutory position and it is difficult to say exactly what that is. I understand, for example, that in 1968 an appeal before the lands evaluation appeal court confirmed an assessor's decision to value a nun's hostel as commercial property. I am not sure upon what grounds it came to its conclusion but it does show that the criteria that were being applied were no those which would be obvious to the layman.<br><br>
We are not only concerned with the kind of property described by Mr. Naumann. The Scottish assessors have indicated that, for example, hostels, boarding houses, service flats, old people's and children's homes, university halls of residence and residential school living accommodation have all been treated on a commercial basis despite the fact that some are not normally considered to be commercial types of property. On the other hand, certain other types of property which might be considered comparable to the types already mentioned—for example, old people's sheltered housing, or residential homes composed of self-contained flatlets—have been valued as individual dwelling houses. That shows that the distinction is sometimes arbitrary.<br><br>
We should like to consider the new clause in some detail because there may well be some need for legislative change to clarify the matter. It would be appropriate to discuss this not only with the immediate interested parties but also with the officials of the local authorities and with the assessors themselves. It would be useful to have the views of the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council on something which is relevant to its function.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the one we did not abolish, for precisely this reason. They clearly are a desirable

source of advice in an area of great complexity where it is difficult to conceive of anyone else who could give the same value of advice to the Secretary of State or indeed to this House. This is a legitimate point requiring further consideration and consultation. There are clearly anomalies as the existing factors indicate and if the Committee agree we intend to pursue this in the way that I have indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just a few comments that may be helpful to the Minister. All of us appreciate the submission that was received from the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. May I make one or two observations on the spirit behind the new clause and what the Minister has said? He might have added that he could have kept the Social Work Advisory Committee to look into this. Although it is a question of valuation and rating to some extent, there is no doubt that confusion arises in the grouping of single homeless between any single person who is adequate and, whether working or not, is capable of handling his affairs, and someone who has a psychiatric or drink problem. To my mind—I think I have had the same sort of experience as the Minister —this is mixed up when we are looking at the problems of the single homeless. I say this, I hope, with some sympathy and understanding.<br><br>
I should not like us to leave the impression that we should add problems to assessors. The simplest way to help people seems to be to treat living accommodation on all fours. In other words, charitable status for all sorts of organisations is a nuisance in rating and valuation; I am sure it must be for the assessors.<br><br>
Therefore I am trying to arrive at some kind of even-handed way on the valuation side, but really to investigate whether adequate support is given to the specific bodies or organisations who look after people with problems. I do not know whether I make myself clear. A charitable organisation should not merely be involved in providing living accommodation for single people. I do not whether I am making clear the distinction I am trying to draw between single people who need help and just single people. I hope I have indicated adequately to the Minister that I recognise that this is a complex problem and we really need to try to separate the charitable status on the one hand from the commercial interests in encouraging accommodation for single people and finally the kind of social problems associated with many single people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should be satisfied at this point with what the Minister has said. I notice Mr. Naumann himself says
<br><blockquote><p>"As far as the rating provisions are concerned, I must emphasise that there are some aspects which still confuse me."</p></blockquote>
That is a modest claim. I would be very happy if it were only "some aspects" that still confused me. If the Minister wishes still to have a look at this, but is seized that there is a genuine problem, I am to that extent reassured.<br><br>
As always, we would be anxious about the time-scale and we hope the delay will not be too long. I warn him that I shall keep these points at the back of my mind. I will not say I shall find an occasion to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
harry him if the delay continues, but at least I shall remind him that they are on the agenda and we hope that progress will be made as rapidly as possible. Certainly the whole situation is confused, and it is important that we encourage the provision of an adequate and sympathetically staffed hostel accommodation for the single homeless wherever possible.<br><br>
Having said that, Mr. Gourlay, we must leave it in the Minister's hands and hope that the results of his deliberations will be productive. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that we have come to the end of our deliberations, Mr. Gourlay, may I, I hope on behalf of the whole Committee, thank you for the excellent and courteous but firm way in which you have chaired our proceedings, which I am sure will be agreed by all Members of the Committee?<br><br>
If, as I presume is possible, you are shortly to chair similar considerations on the Education (Scotland) Bill, I am sure I speak for all the Committee in saying that you will look back on this Committee as a very tranquil, pleasant and perhaps short experience compared with that which you may still have to look forward to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, Mr. Gourlay, associate the Opposition with the remarks of the Under-Secretary. I thought that when he enumerated your many virtues in the Chair, he perhaps put a slight emphasis on the word "firm" which was not entirely misplaced.<br><br>
May I say that under your amiable authority, time has flown. Indeed, I find myself wondering how I shall put in the weeks that lie ahead without the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill to keep me happy and content. But, genuinely, I am grateful for your help, Mr. Gourlay, and for the help of everyone—the Clerk and those who have organised us and got us in and out of here at the appointed times. I would merely like to thank you, Mr. Gourlay, and all of them for their assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank both the Minister and the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for their generous remarks. With reference to time passing quickly, may I say that one of the first things that a Chairman has to do is a little statistical exercise. Of the 43 hours 50 minutes that we have spent in the Committee, the two hon Members who have just spoken have absorbed about 51 per cent. of the time, the hon Member for Garscadden leading by about 'two and a half hours.<br><br>
May I thank the Clerk, Mr. Cooper, and the other gentlemen who have assisted us up here, not least Mr. John Parker, the Hansard Senior Reporter.<br><br>
I hope that the next Committee is as amenable and quiet as this one.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at seven minutes past One o'clock.</i></p>
