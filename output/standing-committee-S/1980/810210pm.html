	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)(Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 13</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>REDUCTION OF RATE SUPPORT GRANT WHERE LOCAL AUTHORITY'S ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>this day</i>], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned, I was replying to points made by the Opposition and, in particular, describing the timetable that might apply if these provisions were passed and the Secretary of State wished to apply them. I said that we hoped, if an order proved necessary under these provisions, to make it available for consideration by Parliament in about June or July of the year in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although that might be the time when Parliament considered those matters, the local authority would know some time before that an order was contemplated in respect of it, for the Secretary of state would have had to submit the order to the authority for its comments. Therefore, for some time before the month in which Parliament considered such an order an authority would be well aware of the implications for itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that there is any possibility of litigation taking place, in the sense that a local authority may have recourse to the courts for a legal opinion on the criteria for what is "excessive and unreasonable" that are applied by the Secretary of State? If that happened, would it prolong the timetable that he has described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Courts do not exist merely to give opinions. A local authority could consult its lawyers if it wished for an opinion. Anyone—private citizen or local authority—can have the matter resolved by the courts if it is believed that the Government are acting unlawfully or contrary to statute. It is not for me to speculate what the courts would determine in a hypothetical situation. What we are discussing in the clause is the discretion of the Secretary of State. It would have to be shown that the Secretary of State had exercised his discretion in bad faith, or something of that kind. I only give an opinion here. It is not for me to say what the courts would consider relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I appreciate that I am not quite as au fait with the technicalities as the Minister is.
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
I am trying to get on record that it is not inconceivable that a local authority which feels aggrieved could have recourse to the courts, by whatever means is appropriate, and that that could slow down the procedures. The authority might not act with such an aim in view, but it might drag the whole process into August and so frustrate an early consideration of the matter by the House, as it would probably be in recess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not come to such a conclusion. The procedure laid down by Act of Parliament would simply be that the Secretary of State had to submit to the local authority the reasons why he proposed to ask Parliament to sanction the withdrawal of grant. The local authority could make its representations, and, if the Secretary of State were still of that mind, he would then present the order to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority believed that the Secretary of State, either on this issue or any other, is acting contrary to statute, it might seek to raise the matter in the courts. But unless and until the courts ruled that the Secretary of State was acting unlawfully he would be entitled to do what the Act says he is permitted to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether the mere fact that the local authority was considering taking the issue to court would delay matters, the answer is "No, not automatically." The Secretary of State would, of course, respond to any order of the courts. But, if there is no such order, the mere fact that a local authority is aggrieved is not sufficient to determine the outcome. The Bill provides, as did the previous legislation, that if the Secretary of State cannot persuade the local authority of the rightness of his cause, Parliament might wish to take that into account. That is for Parliament to decide when considering whether to approve an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the hon. Gentleman can be reassured, if he is concerned that the local authority would not be able to accommodate a reduction in its rate support grant, that the question is at what stage the local authority had reason to believe that it might be likely to lose rate support grant. A local authority which is setting out to be extravagant by having major increases in its expenditure probably has a good idea before even the Secretary of State contacts it that it may be a target for such proposed action. Even if the local authority did not expect to be considered as one of those authorities indulging in unreasonable and excessive expenditure, it would discover that fact at an early date, because of the consultations and opportunity for representation provided by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is that the procedure under the clause will be far easier for the local authority than the procedure under existing statute. Under the existing statute, if the Secretary of State wishes to withdraw a grant, not only does the local authority not find that out until the following year, but it finds it out at a time when it is unable to reduce its spending because the spending in respect of which the RSG has been withdrawn has already taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects, therefore, the proposals under the Bill are far more attractive from a responsible local authority's point of view than would be similar powers exercised under existing legislation, because under existing legislation it would be too late to try to economise and to make savings in that year. The savings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
would have to be made from future years' expenditure, although the withdrawal of RSG related to an earlier financial year. That is exactly the problem that the existing legislation creates and that the provisions before the Committee are designed to assist in dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The major attraction of the existing legislation is that it has never been used, and people would be happy for the status quo to be maintained. As regards the choice between legislation which has never been used and legislation which will be used, if the Minister is to be believed, it is clear which the local authorities concerned would find more attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must accept that on two occasions Labour Governments re-enacted the provisions. If they thought that they were unnecessary and had outlived their usefulness, never having been used from 1929 onwards, presumably they would not have included them in their legislation. But in the 1940s and the 1960s, with local government Bills before Parliament, they took the specific decision to re-enact the provisions, indicating, as is clear to anyone who reads the debates of that time, that in certain circumstances they would be perfectly prepared to use them. Maybe those Labour Governments had more-cooperation from Conservative authorities than we receive from certain other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether there were reasons or not can be debated, but the fact remains that the Labour Government were prepared to use those powers, if necessary; otherwise, they would not have re-enacted them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), hit the nail on the head as regards the effect on ratepayers. Their best interests will undoubtedly be served if a local authority does not plan for excessive and unreasonable expenditure, not only because that will remove the need for an excessive rates increase but because, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) acknowledged, it would be irresponsible for a local authority, having been warned that excessive and unreasonable expenditure would result in an equivalent loss of rate support grant, could nevertheless go ahead and squeeze the money from ratepayers—who are in no position to resist such demands—knowing that they are likely to lose equivalent sums of rate support grant. It would be an extraordinary and irresponsible authority which acted in that way. If an authority insists on acting in that manner, it must bear the responsibility for the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities cannot say that the possible application of those powers will be a surprise to them. They have been warned again and again during the past 18 months that if local authorities insist on budgeting irresponsibly for unreasonable and excessive spending, they will lose rate support grant. They are the first to admit that they expect that to happen if they continue in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that knowledge, if authorities insist on budgeting unreasonably and excessively, they must accept the responsibility of explaining and justifying that decision to the ratepayers. The withdrawal of rate support grant
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
in these circumstances would inevitably follow. It is on that basis, therefore, that the clause is a more sophisticated version of a Labour provision. It does not embody any new principle regarding a local authority losing rate support grant because of excessive and unreasonable expenditure. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition will vote against the clause tonight. This will not come as a surprise to those hon Members who have been present throughout our proceedings, and the information will benefit those who have just returned. I am glad that the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) is present. I hope that he will reply to the charges made against him for remaining silent when he was confronted with a Tory budget which would have reduced the rates in Lothian had there been enough members of the council to support it. I shall return to that subject later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the clause primarily because the powers of the Secretary of State to withdraw rate support grant finance will be available on prospective figures rather than on retrospective outturn information, as was the case following the 1929, 1947 and 1966 legislation. The Minister claims that in principle the powers are no different from those acquired under, I believe, three Labour Governments for there was probably a Labour Government in 1929, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was Baldwin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was responsible for many things. Certainly the 1929 Labour Government did not take advantage of the Liberals' support to overturn the legislation. It has to be admitted that, on one reading anyway, there is no issue of principle here in that respect, but our argument is that the circumstances of the 1980s are very different from those pertaining to the 1940s and 1960s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At no time until the mid-1970s had the Government seen fit to request substantial cuts by local authorities. The Co-operation achieved by my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Milian) was not simply on the basis of loyalty; the general thrust of the Government's policies was seen to be fair, and it had a degree of support from the Labour local authorities in power then. It is a convenient conjunction for Conservative local authorities to have their political wishes reinforced by a Labour Government, in the sense that the Conservative Party invariably wishes to cut back on local authority services, in the view that the rates have to be kept as low as possible. The co-operation that my right hon Friend received as Secretary of State was based on the cuts being temporary. It was clear that as the economy under the last Government improved so the opportunity to expand local government services would increase. The support received in the 1978 and 1980 elections by these policies and the local authorities responsible for co-operating in them—certainly the Labour authorities—is a clear indication of the widespread acceptance by the people of Scotland of the good faith of my right hon Friend the Member for Craigton and his administration at St Andrew's House at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, such is the deterioration in relations between Tory central Government and local government that local authorities of all political persuasions, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
organisations such as COSLA, even in the form of its Tory spokesman, are not persuaded of the desirability of this legislation. In fact, the lesson of last year was probably that without special treatment Tory area rate rises would have been as high as those in Labour areas. The switch in the needs resources element in the rate support grant settlement meant that many of the Conservative authorities would have had rate rises almost as high as those of some Labour authorities and, indeed, higher than other Labour authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman aware that today, for example, Grampian region announced an 11.4 per cent. rates increase for the forthcoming year? Will the hon Gentleman say which of the Labour-controlled regional councils is likely to achieve a similar result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point, though I had not heard that the figure was 11.4 per cent. I knew that it was around 12 to 14 per cent. If the people of Grampian are happy with the services that they will receive with an 11.4 per cent. settlement, that is well and good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>[Aberdeenshire, East]</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might interest the hon. Gentleman to know that not only has Grampian been able to set the rate at 11.4 per cent., but it has increased the social services by about £80,000, and there is a further increase in the home help figures for the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for that information, though I am not sure of the significance of the £80,000 figure. If the hon. Gentleman would say what the total budget was and what the planned increases in expenditure were, it might mean a little more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the increase in expenditure on social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A figure of £80,000 is meaningless unless one knows what the total budget is. If the hon. Member is impressed by such a figure, he is easily impressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the needs resources element in the rate support grant settlement, the last three settlements have shifted away from a kind that was financially acceptable to Labour authorities and now favours what are predominantly Conservative authorities. I accept that there are exceptions to that rule. The shift in the ratio from 1.4 to 1.7 and now to 1.9 has severely affected areas, such as Strathclyde, which have problems of inner urban decay and difficulties that are not necessarily related to historical local government factors. It is fair to say that, in the lifetime of the Labour Government, some preference was given, on the basis of extra need, to places such as Glasgow and the depressed areas of Western Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the changes in the ratio for 1980-81 to which he referred affected his regional council—Central regional council—and Falkirk district council very much to their advantage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have come to that point if the Minister had waited. The nature of Central region, its industrial base and the Grangemouth complex—which to a large extent distorted local government financing—has operated, since the reorganisation of local government, against the best interests of that region. Central region is not doing outstandingly better than it did under Labour. I appreciate that there is a small improvement, but it is not particularly significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regions such as Central and Fife were only marginally affected by the reorganisation of local government. In the case of Central region, it simply meant the addition of Clackmannan county, which is a very small area. The addition of the extra services required there made little impression on the administrative and bureaucratic structure of that region. In Fife, the county was simply replaced by a region. Both Stirling county and Fife county had good records of levels of expenditure on the provision of capital buildings, on education and so on—as I am sure you, Mr. Gourlay, are aware from your long experience in Fife local government. Those local authorities, therefore, experienced few of the changes that were so traumatic for other areas in Scotland, when their requirements had to be reassessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem that Lothian had to face when the reforms came was that, over decades, Tory neglect, especially in Edinburgh, had resulted in the region requiring greatly increased expenditure on, for example, education and social work. Lothian wanted over the period to improve the services to a common level that would be available to everybody. The record of Lothian region has been such that there is now a common level of service almost across the board. There are still areas where the authority would like to see a measure of improvement, but, since the reorganisation of local government and since this Government have sought to put the screws on local authorities, the authorities that have suffered most have been, in the main, those such as Lothian and Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there were also Conservative authorities which were similarly affected last year. We have to classify authorities such as Borders as Conservative authorities. The rates in that region rose by 37 per cent. to 38 per cent., which was within only 1 per cent. of Labour Strathclyde and within only 3 per cent. of Labour Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for this legislation to single out Lothian, although I believe that, in the Odeon cinema on Sunday evening, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South singled out Strathclyde—an authority which had been reasonable and had sought to compromise with the Secretary of State last year and tried over the year to introduce cuts and, for all its efforts, was left with a rates rise of 39 per cent., which was only about 2 per cent. below that of Lothian region. The difference between 39 per cent. and 42 per cent. is not great, but it is enough, in the mind of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South for Lothian to be singled out for special treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is prepared to have in his area cuts such as my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) suggested—savings made through changes in school lets for community use which, in the housing estates of South Edinburgh, are clearly important; in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
creases in fees for overseas students to economic levels to save £75,000; course developments postponed in colleges of further education to save £ 1/4 million; the withdrawal of support for the Hillend ski centre; the sacking of nursery teachers or a reduction of 250 secondary teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say that I am not only a Lothian region ratepayer; I am also the husband of a schoolteacher, so I might be thought to have a vested interest in some of these cuts. However, my wife is employed in an area of teacher shortage, so I do not think that they would directly affect her. I must get that in before I am accused of special pleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That list of cuts was proposed by the Conservative group on the Lothian region council. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, in his repeated attacks on Lothian region in the House, has not the guts to tell us which cuts he would defend and which he would support. That is an act of gross political cowardice by the hon. Member. I am waiting to give way to him, but I cannot hear a syllable from him. It seems that the now mute, inglorious hon. Gentleman has finally been silenced. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, who has finally shut him up. It seems that people from his constituency are very good at silencing the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this legislation is to be directed only against the Lothian region, the Bill and the clause are very ill-conceived and spiteful. We know of the services that have been provided by the authority and of its achievements. I refer to the speech made by the Labour leader of the Lothian region, Mrs. Phyllis Herriot, in which she pointed out some of the achievements of this authority which is regarded as profligate and spendthrift. For example, 18 primary schools have been opened since 1975, as have 14 nursery schools, secondary schools and community centres. Bus fares have been kept down. If there is anything which is likely to keep down the cost of living for ordinary city people, it is an attempt to subsidise the Scottish bus group fares or to keep down the cost of the Edinburgh corporation's transport activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prices have been held down for lunch clubs and meals on wheels. Help has been given to the mentally handicapped. Help for the elderly has been quadrupled. There is one home help to every two registered old people in the Lothian region. Is the provision of such services the sort of profligacy that is regarded as excessive and unreasonable? If we cannot look to labour-intensive activities, we can look to the addition of a new sewerage system, which decades of Tory rule denied to Edinburgh. The Tories refused to do anything about providing a decent sewerage system, and the sewerage was pumped into the river Forth for many years. But we are considering the record of an authority whose expenditure is regarded as unreasonable and excessive. We believe that it will be the only authority likely to come under the Minister's microscope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was good enough to reply to some of the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden about the timescale. However, I am still at a bit of a loss. As I said earlier, I am not a lawyer and I may therefore be unduly ignorant or thick about these matters. Nevertheless, in view of the advice that some of us have taken, our reading of the situation is that
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
there is no guarantee that a motion can be put to the House by July, no guarantee that the Bill will be tidied up before the aristocrats on the other side go off to the grouse moors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should look behind him, at his hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The grouse moors are not the sole preserve of the upper classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is every likelihood that this procedure could take until October. I know that the Minister has already said that if an authority thinks that it will be the target, it should not embark on the exercise. I find that statement absolutely ridiculous because it assumes that the House will blindly support the Secretary of State at every turn. If the courts disagree and find that the expenditure is not unreasonable and excessive, the Minister may be seen to be using the criteria in a subjective and political way—acting against what could be regarded as the best interests of the people in the region. Therefore, the courts should have as much say in the matter as the Government, so it is not unreasonable to assume that this expenditure might not have to be clawed back until October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that even if it were October, it would still be far easier for an authority to accommodate a reduction in grant than if that happened a year after the year in which the expenditure was incurred. That is what the Labour provisions would result in if used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Labour Government ask Lothian region Labour Party to make cuts, it is prepared to make them, but when a Conservative Government make a similar request, to which most local authorities have responded, Lothian now decides that it cannot make a single cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I explained earlier that, for different reasons, the circumstances of Lothian and Strathclyde were similar. They both had roughly the same level of rate increase last year. With regard to the good faith of the Labour Party as shown by its ability to be successful and deliver the goods—[Interruption.] Hon Members may laugh, but they may recall that the express purpose of the cuts requested by the Labour Government was to ensure a reduction in the level of inflation. [Interruption.] I accept that the hon Member for Edinburgh, South is both politically cowardly and a lawyer. But if he does not understand that, he will not listen to what I am trying to say. That is probably to his disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am endeavouring to point out in this respect is quite simple. The Labour Government asked for concessions to be made on the basis that the policies would succeed. To the extent that inflation was reduced to 9 per cent. at the time of the general election, these policies were successful. Labour local authorities placed their trust in the Secretary of State in making these cuts, and the cuts proved to be worth while, as they could be used by the Secretary of State to ensure the success of that Government's policies. This Government are clearly not acting in the interests of those whom the local authorities have been democratically elected to protect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is that not the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend, with his great experience of the detailed administration of Lothian region, brings the point clearly to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to one point made by my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden, which I think the Minister forgot. Can the Minister assure us that the cash flow following from the rate support grant will not be affected—or that the Scottish Office will not cut the rate support grant of a local authority in dispute with the Minister—before the House votes on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon Gentleman an assurance, but there is no intention at present to interrupt the flow. He will appreciate that there is no statutory control at present over the way in which rate support grant is paid to local authorities. It is entirely discretionary. We have no intention at present of acting in the way suggested by the hon Gentleman, but I cannot go beyond that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the rate sup-
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
port grant is paid out in instalments, which would not be interrupted prior to a vote in the House of Commons on the authority which would be in dispute. Will the Minister put it on the record that that is so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what I have just said. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an assurance on that point. I can only indicate that at the moment we have no intention of acting in the way he suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, although I am sorry that he cannot be more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition and the Government are poles apart. We recognise that former Labour Governments introduced or inherited legislation which they kept largely intact. In many instances the legislation was equally designed to encourage local authorities which under-spent to meet their statutory responsibilities in future years. In neither case—for excessive spending or underspending—has there been any need to use the legislation which the 1929, 1947 or 1966 Acts encompassed. The Opposition do not see any need for the Government to extend the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government's inability to obtain the co-operation of Labour local authorities—and until this year, many Tory authorities as well, because the level of rates increase was just as high in some areas under Tory control as it was under Labour—is due more to the general thrust of their policies than to the unwillingness of local authorities to assist in reducing public expenditure. Local authorities consider that they have a duty to assist those who are at risk in areas where statutory provision is inadequate--for instance where old age pensions have not kept up with inflation or disability allowances are not adequately supported. Local authorities have the closest responsibility for personal services, and they feel it necessary to sustain levels of expenditure which the Secretary of State considers to be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that local authorities have been elected on programmes expressly intended to provide these services. In the heat of ill-informed and often hysterical debates, of the kind which I understand took place in the Odeon cinema the other evening, it is easy for dishonest politicians to obtain cheap cheers. We have seen today that when confronted with different options the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South was unable to defend the Tory alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will oppose the clause and will continue throughout the passage of the legislation to take every opportunity to defend the rights of local authorities. Many organisations have said that the cause strikes at the heart of local democracy. We are not ashamed to oppose the clause, and my hon. Friend the Member of Garscadden and I will encourage Opposition Members to vote against it. We hope that one or two Conservative Members will summon up the courage of their convictions to join us to defeat this odious clause once and for all and thus render the legislation totally irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that you and my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) will forgive me if I mention two points which have arisen since this morning's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
The Edinburgh Evening News is unduly sensitive because I referred this morning to its meeting as a put-up job—a set-up. I rise, not to apologise, but to amplify the points that I made this morning. That meeting was set up to put the Lothian region on trial. I gather that the Under-Secretary was invited to participate, but refused. It is interesting that when asked to attend a meeting that was avowedly concerned with the Bill and with clause 13 in particular—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The meeting may have been called to discuss the Bill, but what we are discussing now is clause 13 stand part. The hon. Gentleman's remarks do not seem to me to be in order. I allowed him to make some reference to the matter because of his remarks this morning and his reference to the paper, but I cannot allow him to discuss what the meeting was or was not about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that, Mr. Gourlay. I was trying to relate my remarks to clause 13. It is clause 13 that imposes these restrictions on local authorities. The Under-Secretary is the Secretary of State's representative on this matter, and the clause gives the Secretary of State draconian powers. I was pointing out that although the Under-Secretary is willing to talk about these matters in the Committee, he seems unwilling to talk about them on a public platform. That seems to me to be unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you take this debate as an example, Mr. Gourlay, I think it indicates what the Government are trying to do through clause 13 and the Bill as a whole. Their aim—and I think that some of the newspapers are aiding and abetting them—is to put the onus on the local authorities. The very build-up of that meeting, of the great rates debate, shows that people are falling into the trap that Conservative Members want them to fall into. We are talking not just about the amount of income that local authorities get through the rates but also about the income they get through the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary should have the courage of his convictions. He should go to the meetings and explain why he has cut back the rate support grant. He should explain the powers that the Bill will give him to cut back even further. He should explain what the effect on services will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reading through the newspaper account again to study the coverage of the discussion of these items. It is interesting that whenever a Labour Party member is quoted the word "claimed" is used, almost as if there were some doubt in what he or she said. But whenever a Tory spokesman is quoted—like the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram)—the words are "he said" or "he said with affirmation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to be as helpful as I can to the hon. Gentleman, but what happened in Edinburgh on Sunday is not relevant to this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree 100 per cent., Mr. Gourlay. You have indeed been helpful. I have said all that I wanted to say on that topic. I hope that there will be some reaction, here or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is more important and even more relevant. I am sorry that I was late for this afternoon's
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
sitting. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South knows, I was attending another meeting. But I gather that the Under-Secretary has not dealt with the point that I have raised repeatedly in the Committee. If he is to make any pretence to be a Minister of the Crown and to act on behalf of the Government, he must be aware that the properly elected members of a local authority have a number of statutory responsibilities under the health and safety at work legislation, the social work legislation, the chronically sick and disabled persons legislation and various education Acts. The officers of the authorities say that if they adhere to the Government's guidelines they will be in breach of those responsibilities. Does the Under-Secretary condone that breach? Is he encouraging those officers to break the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes without saying that if a local authority, in making representations to the Secretary of State after an indication that these powers might be used, could satisfy the Secretary of State that it could not forgo the expenditure to which he had taken objection without breaking its statutory obligations, the Secretary of State would have to take that into account in considering whether the expenditure was excessive and unreasonable. Keeping the law is not normally an excessive or unreasonable matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time the Under-Secretary has referred to that point. Is he assuring the Committee that if regional and district councils can show beyond doubt that their adherence to the Government's guidelines would result in their breaching one or more statutory provisions, it would be accepted as a reasonable argument and the guidelines would be altered to take account of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we are talking not about guidelines, but about clause 13. I should have thought that this was so self-evident that it should not require saying. We are not talking about whether a local authority claims that its expenditure is necessary to avoid its breaking the law. I said that if the Secretary of State was satisfied that the expenditure that he had thought to be excessive and unreasonable was necessary to avoid a local authority breaking its statutory obligations, that would have to be taken into account in deciding whether it would be right to withdraw rate support grant on the basis of that aspect of expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is not being as helpful as I had thought. He is saying that after the Government have set ridiculously low guidelines, if a local authority goes above them because it feels that it will otherwise breach its statutory responsibilities, the Secretary of State will accept that as an argument for not considering the expenditure excessive and unreasonable when deciding whether to use the powers. That is helpful as far as it goes, but it does not help those authorities that adhere to what the Secretary of State is asking—that they cut their expenditure—and thereby break the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My interpretation of what the hon. Gentleman is saying is that local authorities should budget for what they believe is necessary to carry out their statutory responsi
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
bilities and should then justify to the Secretary of State that that is reasonable under the terms of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend find it rather depressing and a little alarming that all that the Under-Secretary can say is that if there is a question of excessive and unreasonable expenditure and that the defence advanced validly is that that expenditure is to ensure that there is no breach of statutory duty—so that the authority keeps within the law—that will be taken into account. There will not be an automatic agreement that that expenditure could not be excessive and unreasonable. Is that not just plain alarming, and does it not say a lot about the Government's priorities and actions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual my hon. Friend, with his perceptive mind, has put his finger on the point. It is depressing that the Secretary of State would take into account only the fact that local authorities were about to break the law. Where is the party of so-called law and order which keeps telling poor little weans that if they pinch green apples from their next door neighbour, they should be arraigned before the children's panel? Here, that party not only condones but encourages local authorities to break the law by underspending and therefore being unable to carry out their statutory responsibilities. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench will pursue this matter, because it is one of the most serious points that have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quoted Councillor Mackie earlier. There are local authorities which are being put in a position of breaking the law. It is not only Tayside, it concerns the whole country. I am sure, that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said, the Lothian regional expenditure is required to enable it to carry out the services and meet the needs of the Lothian region. If it had to rate at that level to carry out its statutory responsibilities—which is all that it is doing—it is self-evident that the other local authorities are in breach of the law. Both the Secretary of State and, in particular, the Under-Secretary must take the blame for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) asked me to clarify the £84,000 increase on social services in the Grampian region, with only an 11.4 per cent increase in the domestic rate. Last year Grampian region spent £14 million on social services, and the increase of £84,000 this year includes £54,000 for help for the elderly and the employment of a further 31 home helps, which, in circumstances of severe financial restraint, is very good for any local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that those figures are not in constant terms. Making allowances for inflation, that is almost certainly a cut in real expenditure on social work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a cut in real expenditure. There is an increase of £84,000 on the gross figures of last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may wish to correct my arithmetic, Mr. Gourlay, but I worked that out to represent
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
an increase of about 0.4 per cent. Perhaps that figure could be checked by one of the scribes toy our right, but it does not seem that impressive. A figure as modest as that does not really merit a line in the Press and Journal tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before moving the amendment, may I have your guidance on a couple of minor points. Mr. Gourlay? As you will be aware, perhaps even more than I, a number of amendments have not been favoured by selection—namely, amendments Nos. 97, 102, 98. 103, 99, 101 and 104, all of which refer to clause 14. As I understand it—I take responsbility for this—the reason for their non-selection is that a group of technical amendments were moved in the debate on clause 13, some of which apparently related to sections of clause 14. My attention has been directed to page 521 of Erskine May, where one reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An amendment must not be inconsistent with, or contrary to, the bill as so far agreed to by the committee, nor must it be inconsistent with a decision of the committee upon a former amendment."</p></blockquote>
I take that to mean that although the amendments that referred to clause 14 were extremely technical they have led to the striking out of substantial amendments which had they been down at that stage, would no doubt have been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that it will be possible at least to raise some of the principles involved in the clause stand part debate, but there is one almost typographical point about which I should like to be clear. In clause 14, at line 35, the word "such" appears on its own. Government amendment No. 47, which is to be moved only formally for the reason that I have given, which I regret, seeks to:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out subparagraph (ii) and insert."</p></blockquote>
certain words. Does sub-paragraph (ii) include the word "such" on line 35? I assumed that it did not, and typographically it does not appear to do so. It affects the grammatical sense of the Bill. I am anxious to have your guidance, Mr. Gourlay, whether amendment No. 47 removes that word "such".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the custom of the Chair to give reasons why amendments are not selected. I understand that the hon. Gentleman has discussed the matter with the Clerk. If he had cared to, he could have discussed the matter with me before the sitting. I am still willing to discuss it at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, the word "such" is not included in sub-paragraph (ii).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information, Mr. Gourlay. That was my impression. I draw your attention to amendment No. 104, which has not been selected and which would take out the word "such". Perhaps you would like to consider this at some length. Putting it all together is a complicated matter, but if we take the amended part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act, read into it the new amendments in clause 14 and substitute Government amendment No. 47 for subparagraph (ii), it seems that we have a grammatical nonsense which can be corrected only by amendment No. 104. It would take a long time to piece all that together, but perhaps it will be easiest if I quickly read the bones of it. Part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act would read as follows:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to any provisions made by virtue of section 4(5) of the Act and paragraph 3 below the amount of the resources element payable to a local authority for any year shall be the product of</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the number of pence in the pound of the regional, general or district rate, as the case may be, or where the Secretary of State is as regards the local authority of the opinion"</p></blockquote>
we now take in another Government amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) that they have fixed a rate higher than that required to provide the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973; or"</p></blockquote>
we then leave out sub-paragraph (ii) and incorporate Government amendment No. 47—
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) satisfied as is mentioned in subsection (1)(c), as read with subsection (1A) of section 5 of this Act,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>such"—</p></blockquote>
then we go back to the original part II—
	<br><blockquote><p>"such lesser number of pence"</p></blockquote>
In those circumstances we shall need an amendment along the lines of amendment No. 104. 1 wonder, Mr. Gourlay, whether it would be more convenient to select it and deal with it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The effect of amendment No. 96 would be to take out the words "among other things". I do not think that we need to have these words, as they are redundant. What would be left is the information that part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act specifies the method of calculating the amount of any of the resources element payable to a local authority.

I need not refer to what else there is in this liquorice allsorts clause. Although I do not wish to be seen to be a fidget about matters literary, and about grammatical and stylistic points, those words are redundant, and we might as well have them out of the Bill at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 105 covers a similar point. As you fairly indicated, Mr. Gourlay, clause 14 is a complicated clause which requires scurrying around from the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 across to the 1966 Act and then through a series of competing amendments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
which appear in the present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 contains a very long explanatory passage in brackets:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which, for the purposes of the said calculation allows the Secretary of State, if he is of the opinion that the rate fixed by the local authority is unnecessarily high, to use as multiplicand a lesser figure than the number of pence in the pound of that rate".</p></blockquote>
That seems to me to be extremely infelicitously phrased, and I took a slight allergy to the word "multiplicand".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assumed when I first read those words that if I were to go to part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act, I should find—as always with clauses in the main body of an Act—that there was a side rubric explaining what was in the section, and that those words were a straight lift of that rubric. In that case, I might have groaned heavily in spirit, but I should have learnt to live with, if not love, it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at the schedule to the 1966 Act, I discover—as I should have remembered—that there are no such side notes, no such rubric and no such running summaries in the schedule. Therefore, the pretty horrific form of words in brackets in clause 14 is the product of the fertile, but I think rather tendentious mind, of some civil servant in the inner recesses of the Scottish Office. I know not if he is here present, but in any event he should be asked to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The version in my amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"allows the Secretary of State to use in said calculation a figure lower than the number of pence in the pound levied as a rate by the local authority."</p></blockquote>
Those words seem to be more comprehensible to the ordinary mortal. Either version assumes that the reader has some knowledge of how the resources element of the rate support grant is compiled. Without knowing that, both versions take one only a little way down the road to enlightenment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we assume that people know that there is a multiplication sum, and what is involved in that sum, we are in a better situation if we remove words such as "multiplicand" and the complexity of the form which has been picked by the advisers to the Secretary of State. I do not claim that the words which I am substituting are elegant prose: they are not likely to be included in anyone's compendium of gems of the English language. For all that, they seem to possess a few basic and homely virtues which avoid unnecessary words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a small point, but the Secretary of State's version has 47 words in it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am prepared to accept the Minister's figure. No doubt he has been counting on his fingers and his toes, and perhaps even the fingers and toes of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), because at 48 he is getting into some difficulties if he sticks to his own outer extremities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept that 48 words is right, but—this is the killing point—my version has only 29 words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, we agree that there is a substantial saving in using the form of words which I have suggested. It is more easily understood and, although I do not wish to dignify it with the word "elegant" because it cannot claim such finery, at least it is less objectionable than the somewhat pompous and pseudo-technical phrases such as "multiplicand" which have been dreamt up by the Scottish Office, which have been smuggled into what is admittedly a technical Bill, but which do it no service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this amendment, without pretending that it is a matter of principle or that it will alter the sense of the Bill, but as a small contribution to drafting sanity and to console the reader of this otherwise depressing legislative effort. I shall be asking leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to be becoming a tendency of those who claim to speak on behalf of the Labour Party that they have little knowledge of arithmetic and great interest in philosophy. It seems that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is following his Leader in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the first amendment, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect. If there is to be a reference to previous legislation, it should be correct. If the phrase "amongst other things" is to be used, it is necessary because, apart from the matter which is then described, there is an addition to provide for the calculation of the amount of a local authority's share of resources element. Part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act goes on to provide for recalculation in consequence of any significant change in the rateable value of the area and for recalculation in appropriate circumstances of the penny rate product. It would not therefore be appropriate to remove the words to which the hon. Gentleman has objected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the second amendment, I share the hon. Gentleman's distaste for the word "multiplicand", which I cannot claim to have used before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a minor drafting point. I will ask the draftsman to consider whether his form of words is absolutely necessary, but I cannot give an assurance to the hon. Gentleman. I agree with him in principle that we want these provisions to be as simple as possible, but we must not seek simplicity at the expense of accuracy. The hon Gentleman, as a lawyer, will appreciate the importance of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recommend the hon. Gentleman's first amendment, but we will consider his second amendment and decide whether a simpler form of words would be more appropriate and, if so, whether the hon. Gentleman's proposal would be an accurate reflection of what this part of the clause is intended to refer to. With this explanation, I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My worry about "multiplicand" is that I have difficulty pronouncing it, never mind understanding it. Without being thirled to the form of words I put down, I think we could do better than what at present is in clause 14. With the happy thought that as the Under-Secretary goes home to his Horlicks or cocoa in the nights ahead, he will be experimenting with new and more acceptable forms of words to insert within these brackets, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was put down in a rush of enthusiasm. If I may make a confession to the Committee, it would have been withdrawn if certain other amendments had stood their ground. However, as they have disappeared, I intend to move the amendment formally with a view to discovering a thing or two about the Government's state of mind. It is a brave man who wishes to know about the Under-Secretary's state of mind. However, we must steel ourselves to face even the most unpleasant of prospects. The clause is of some substance, and perhaps--I put it no higher than that—we shall vote against it on stand part. My present inclination is to recommend that course to my hon. Friends. It may be useful if we discuss the amendment briefly and obtain further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision purports to insist that, before the Secretary of State can use a figure below the number of pence in the actual rate poundage levied for the calculation of the resources element in the rate support grant, he has to be "of the opinion"—not "satisfied", but "of the opinion"—that one of two alternatives applies. I stress that as an aide-memoire to the Minister, who will recall that in clause 13 the Secretary of State has to be "satisfied". The argument came up the other day that consistency had certain merits, and the Minister conceded that perhaps the word "satisfied" should be repeated in later parts of clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought, therefore—although I merely animadvert to the point, Mr. Gourlay, as my amendments have not been called—that it would have been better to use the word "satisfied" instead of the phrase "of the opinion" in the new form included in clause 14, which is to be grafted into part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a suggestion that the words that appeared in the old schedule to the 1962 Act—that is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the local authority have fixed an unnecessarily high rate"—</p></blockquote>
should be amplified so that the Secretary of State must be of the opinion either that
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"they have fixed a rate higher than that required to provide the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973; or (ii) that the total estimated expenses mentioned in the said section 108(2) are excessive and unreasonable, regard being had to the financial and other relevant circumstances mentioned in section 5(1)(c) of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I have already fallen into a trap; I made the terrible mistake of reading clause 14 as it was published. You will have realised my mistake, Mr. Gourlay—we should take out sub-paragraph (ii), and the word "or", mentioned in the amendment, will run on to the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied as is mentioned in subsection (1)(c), as read with subsection (1A), of section 5 of this Act."</p></blockquote>
That shows how easy it is to get confused between the various pieces of paper, statutes and occasional thoughts emanating from Government quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I consider the amendment, my first impression is that it does not make much sense, and is hardly worth an argument. However, when I think again, I believe that by pressing it we may underline one of the essential difficulties of operating the clause. There may well be a case for inserting the word "and", if only because that will draw attention to what seems to me the extremely peculiar situation developing in the amplification of the machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made the point on clause 13, and he could make it again now, perhaps with a little more justification, that this is really a question of practice rather than of principle, a question whether a new definition will change the atmosphere in which a statutory provision will be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, in the original part II of schedule 1 of the Act there is the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the local authority have fixed an initially high rate".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the new form of words that we are being invited to consider—whether it should be "and" or "or" which governs the two possibilities—would operate in the same sort of argument. It is not a totally new departure, but again is a re-vamp. I suppose that it is an attempt to give the proposals teeth. Alternatively, if one wanted to be more neutral—as politicians can be when they are being devious and slipping in wicked proposals by the back door—it might be called a matter of clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new proposals will make a considerable difference to the way in which the legislation operates. It is as well to put that on record. When we come to clause stand part—which I believe will be shortly, because there are few amendments—many of us will want to say something about the way that the Government have changed their attitude to the resources element as against that of need, and about the movement in the ratio of the past two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that there has been some local government support for what has happened in that respect, but it is a matter of some controversy, which we shall want to consider. But this amendment, concerning the words "or" and "and", clearly goes to the heart of how the resources element is calculated, leaving aside the wider question whether there should be a ratio against the needs element of 1 to 9 or 1 to 7 or 1 to 4—or any of the formulae that have been bandied about or used in the recent past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
Many members of the Committee and those who take the trouble to read its proceedings will be familiar with the way in which the resources element is calculated. One of the good points about a parliamentary report is that it often gives that sort of information in a convenient and compact form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Under-Secretary of State will confirm whether my facts are correct. As I understand the matter, which is fundamental to the amendment and the clause, the resources element for any local authority is based on a multiplication. "Multiplicands"—to use the current jargon of the Committee—are employed. The multiplication is of the number of pence in the rate poundage—or a lesser number than that, as the Secretary of State considers appropriate—by the difference between the penny rate product and the local authority's penny rate. There will be no great difficulty between us about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to tell the Minister—again, I may be displaying my lamentable ignorance, but 1 am probably not alone in that—that I have never been very clear about how the standard penny rate product is arrived at. Clearly, if the total amount of money is altered, what goes to each local authority will also be affected. But to achieve the right result at the end of the calculations—I make no charge of duplicity against this Administration; it is true of any Government—the standard penny rate product must be arrived at rather arbitrarily, or subjectively. When the calculations are done, the correct global amount of money has to equate with what has been decided subjectively by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene, but I understood the hon. Gentleman to be moving the amendment formally. However, he now seems to be making a clause stand part speech. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Formally" was a rather quaintly-chosen word, Mr. Gourlay. It was meant to indicate that I did not intend to divide the Committee. I did not expect that my amendment would find a great deal of favour, but I think that it illustrates some important idiosyncracies of this part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be, Mr. Gourlay, if you will allow me to go rather wide—I am in the hands of my hon. Friends—that we might well treat this largely as a clause stand part debate. We recognise that we would not be able to trespass on your tolerance at that stage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that might be for the convenience of the Committee, because I fail to appreciate the arguments in favour of "and" or "or" from what the hon. Gentleman said. Therefore, for my part, I shall be quite happy to allow a wide debate on the amendment and to do away with a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that would be sensible, Mr. Gourlay. I make no bones about the "and" or "or" amendment being misconceived, fundamentally. I think it might be better to make this a clause stand part debate, and we could proceed from there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having got that clear—I am grateful for your help, Mr. Gourlay—I am aware of the general outline of the resources element calculation. What I have never been
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
clear about and would genuinely like to know is exactly how the standard penny rate product is fixed. We know that the effects of its fixing or, perhaps, of its calculation, are that certain authorities do not benefit from the resources element, but I believe that that could usefully be explained to the Committee and, certainly, to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the criteria laid down—the position about which the Secretary of State has to be satisfied before he can avail himself of the change in the calculation which we are debating and before he can set the "multiplicand" at a number which is below the number of pence in the actual rate poundage levy. In passing—perhaps this is something I should know and about which the Minister may be able to enlighten me—there is reference in the statute to "regional rate" and "district rate", which I well understand, and "general rate". I have never been terribly clear about what is "general rate" in that form of words, and I wonder whether that is now archaic, because, although I hear many complaints about regional rates and district rates, I have never had a complaint about general rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It refers to the islands. The island authorities, of course, are all-purpose authorities and, therefore, they use this phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows how sometimes the most obvious of explanations can be overlooked. No doubt if I lived in one of the islands, I would not have asked that question. I was somewhat relieved to notice that whispering took place before that answer was forthcoming and, therefore, I suspect that I was not alone in being momentarily puzzled by that turn of phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the important point is that, before the Secretary of State can have that variation in one factor in this interesting multiplication which leads to the resources element being apportioned, he must be satisfied or be of opinion that the local authority has:
	<br><blockquote><p>"fixed a rate higher than that required to provide the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973".</p></blockquote>
Very understandably, when first I read that, being something of a tyro in this sphere, I went with eager enthusiasm to section 108(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act. I shall paraphrase what I found, Mr. Gourlay. You will probably be grateful to know that I shall take out what I call the grammatical guts of the paragraph rather than reading it in extenso. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every local authority to determine such regional, general or district rate … as will provide sufficient moneys to meet such part of the total estimated expenses to be incurred by the authority during the financial year in respect of which the rate is to be levied … as falls to be met out of moneys raised by rates, together with such additional amount as is, in the opinion of the authority, required—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… to cover expenses previously incurred,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… to meet contingencies,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… to meet any expenses which may fall to be met before the moneys to be received in respect of the regional, general or district rate, as the case may be, for the financial year next following the first-mentioned year will become available."</p></blockquote>
So far as I can see, that means that the local authority will fix whatever rate seems appropriate. There is nothing obviously set about that. After all, even the guidelines mentioned in the circulars that flow every year from the Scottish Office are not mandatory, we are told, but merely advisory. We may have been dis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
cussing for many a weary day the threats which lie behind some of the new provisions but, for all that, they are not mandatory, and there is nothing in section 108(2) which helps a local authority. It has only to decide how much it wants to meet from the rates, to levy the rate appropriately to meet that, and to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards paragraph 1, dealing with an authority that may have levied a rate higher than is required to meet its expenditure, there is nothing new in this provision. It is taken directly from the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966, schedule 1, pt. II, paragraph 2(a), and is simply brought together with the other circumstance for convenience for the future use of the Bill. In other words, clause 14(i) of the Bill is not new law, but is a straight repetition of the provisions of the 1966 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful. There is sometimes a childlike faith among Ministers that if they can explain where a certain form of statutory words comes from that, that removes any sort of query, discussion or speculation about the meaning or possible effect in operation of that form of words. The fact that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has been able to give me a genuine pedigree, in regard to earlier legislation, does not stop me from asking a few questions about how it is likely to operate. It is on that course that I am endeavouring to set out, although I agree that the preliminaries have been somewhat long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In studying section 108(2), it is clear, as I have said, that the local authority has a wide measure of discretion. I agree that there are indications in the guidelines, but the discretion remains, at least nominally, unfettered. I find it peculiar that we are now in a situation where the Government are allowing local authorities unfettered discretion, and that in subparagraph (ii), which follows, they are trying to remove that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation now exists where local authorities will have a statutory duty, under the 1973 Act, to rate as they see appropriate—which it almost amounts to—and yet under subparagraph (ii) they are immediately told that if, in the mind of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the rating is excessive and unreasonable, they will be hammered, because they will then find that the calculation of the resources element is adjusted, presumably to their disadvantage. It seems strange that these two provisions have been combined as alternatives in the same clause in this amplification to the 1966 Act. Subparagraph (i) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that they have fixed a rate higher than that required to provide the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2)."</p></blockquote>
Can the Secretary of State tell us exactly when, or how, he judges that local authorities have done that? We know that it is entirely at the discretion of local authorities how much money they want to raise under the provisions of section 108(2). Presumably his knowledge, or his judgment, about whether they have raised more money than necessary is based upon a sort of return at the beginning of the year which indicates the intention of the local authorities at that point, and, if they then rate to produce a surplus, they are presumably caught under this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a new provision. As with the 1966 Act, the budget which the local authority supplies under section 199 to the Secretary of State indicates its total estimated expenditure. If it were to fix a rate which provided greater income than was required to meet that expenditure, that would be the circumstance in which both this and the previous provision applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that if a local authority rates to provide more income than at the beginning of the year it said it required, in relation to its budgeting, it is likely to be caught under this provision, and the effect of that will be that it will be open to the Secretary of State—it is not then an automatic consequence—to decide to take as the multiplicand in the resources calculation not the actual number of pence in the rate poundage but some lesser figure. I presume that the Secretary of State will agree that the effect of doing that would be less money for that local authority.

The hon. Gentleman will be more familiar than I am with the Fifth Report of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland which came out in September, 1980. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to appendix F, which shows that a surprisingly large number of local authorities had a rating revenue surplus as at 31 March 1980. The rating revenue surpluses are shown as a percentage of net rate income for the year. Let us take Stewartry as an example. It is a small local authority, but it may be of interest to the Under-Secretary. Stewartry is in a constituency held by a Conservative Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the skin of his teeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says "By the skin of his teeth." Stewartry has a rating revenue surplus which is 263 per cent. of the net rate income for the year. Presumably, that means that Stewartry has been rating for a surplus for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. We are talking about where a local authority indicates in its budget its total expenditure for that year and then sets a rate figure that, together with its RSG, would provide it with a sum greater than that budget. The fact that the authority has surpluses which it has chosen not to use is not directly relevant to the 1966 Act or to the clause. We are talking about a situation where the rate income, plus the RSG income and any other income that the authority receives, is greater than the proposed expenditure as disclosed in its budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. I am not mistaken on the assumption on which I am working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if an authority over a period of years has an RSG settlement, and on top of that has raised a certain amount of rate revenue, and those two combined have exceeded its expenditure, it will have built up surpluses. If we take, for example, the councils which appear in appendix F, I assume that what has happened over a period of years is that they have a surplus because of two factors that the Minister has just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that section 108(2) of the

1973 Act requires a local authority, in determining what its expenses and budget ought to be, to take into account any balances which it has outstanding. Line 5 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"(after taking account of any balance or estimated balance at the end of the financial year immediately preceding that year)".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the local authority is expected to consider the use of its accumulated surplus, but I am advised that that is not an automatic requirement as a result of this provision, as it must apply the whole of that surplus to contributing towards the expenditure which it proposes in the following year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely on a voyage of exploration in trying to get information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether the Minister should help the Chair, too. I understood that, since 1947, the practice had been that local authorities could not rate for a surplus but had to use any surpluses which were outstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that they have to take account of any surpluses outstanding, but they do not automatically have to apply the whole of an existing surplus for expenditure purposes for the following year. You are correct, Mr. Gourlay, in saying that authorities cannot rate in the knowledge that the sums they will raise from rates will be greater than the sums they intend to spend as disclosed by their budgets. They cannot rate for a surplus in that sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, but to tie up the information and make things clear for me, is there anything in the criterion in (i), namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that they have fixed a rate higher than that required to provide the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2)".</p></blockquote>
—I agree that this is not mandatory because he would use his discretion—that would allow the Secretary of State to use the section 14 powers and to make a change in the calculation of the resources element in the rate support grant in order to stop what has been happening in Stewartry, Annandale and Eskdale, Kincardine Deeside, Badenoch and Strathspey and Tweeddale, the top 10 in this list, and in many other authorities which all have rating revenue surpluses that are 125 per cent. of net rate income for a year or more? Those authorities appear to have been building up substantial surpluses. If they have to take into account under section 108(2), they have done so to little effect because the surpluses have been building up. Can the Under-Secretary of State say whether the machinery would allow him to recalculate the resources element in the way outlined in the change in section 14? And, if they did recalculate, what would be the effect on those authorities of the money they received under the rate support grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that, under the provision in clause 14, it might well be competent for the Secretary of State to act in the way that the hon. Gentleman indicated. But clearly it would be more advisable for individual local authorities to respond to the comments made by the auditor as regards the use of surpluses. If there was a gross example that the Secretary of State felt it appropriate to take into account, that power would probably be available to him both under this
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
provision and under existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be caught under clause 13, which relates to expenditure, because that is the very opposite issue. This is a matter of accumulated surpluses. As the Minister will no doubt accept, the Controller of Audit is fairly critical of those local authorities, which is why the list has been compiled. So I urge him to consider whether, if there is no response, he wishes to think again about the clause 14 machinery. Perhaps we can return to this point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the criteria in subparagraph (ii) because they interest me greatly. I will not try the Committee's patience, but it would be possible to have again each of our debates on clause 13 in terms of the criteria, the lack of control and what seems to us to be the despotic and dictatorial reign that could result from clause 13. Amendment No. 47, the proposed new subparagraph (ii), would provide that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"is satisfied as is mentioned in subsection (1)(c), as read with subsection (1A), of section 5 of this Act".</p></blockquote>
That takes us back to subsection (1)(c), which we considered to be excessive and unreasonable, given the financial and other relevant circumstances of the area of the authority—there are the joint board clause, the comparability criteria, the general economic conditions criteria and, above all, our favourite—what "he", that is, the Secretary of State "considers appropriate". So all the dangerous provisions of clause 13 are being happily smuggled in to clause 14 under the guise of a minor clarification of existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have spent many hours discussing the provisions and the clause against which we have just voted—unsuccessfully, unfortunately—I do not wish to raise them all again in detail. Let me record the Opposition's feelings that the safeguards are totally unsatisfactory and that the way in which this has been done seems unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made one or two, not sweeping, but tentative promises to consider rewording certain parts. The "area of" was a phrase under dispute and is now being taken to avisandum, or at least the Civil Service drafting department. Also we have had a promise that criterion (c)—"as he considers appropriate"—will also be given scrutiny. I hope that these matters will be given serious consideration because they not only appear in clause 13 but, if the serried ranks of the Patronage Secretary's vote is deployed, they will no doubt also appear in due course in clause 14. We find the whole matter to be thoroughly unsatisfactory in every way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 has been considered at some length by a number of the bodies which have a direct interest in it. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, has made it clear that it does not favour the clause and that it should, as it baldly puts it, "be deleted from the Bill"—liquidated, so to speak. It has given reasons for that opinion which other hon. Members on the Committee may wish to take up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in histrionics. At this time of night, on the second sitting of the Committee today, I do not think that histrionics will impress anyone. I certainly do not intend to indulge in them. But we have seen again the smuggling in by the back door of a large number of unjustified powers which the Secretary of State should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
not be taking upon himself. That has added to the general atmosphere of suspicion between local and central government, and will do nothing to bolster the Secretary of State's reputation for fairness and impartiality as the months roll on. I almost said "years", but I remain a firm optimist and 1 shall not inflict on long-suffering Scotland, even as a figure of speech, the prospect of some years of this sort of legislative initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many questions which could be asked about the way in which the resources element has been manipulated. There are local authorities which have liked the change in the ratio between the resources and the needs element. We live in a practical world and there are local authorities whose opposition is muted because they have not benefited. Those local authorities, Falkirk district, which is well-known to my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire and Central region, are examples. They are authorities which, because of peculiarities—Edinburgh district council is one—have had idiosyncratic rating structures and have not, therefore, previously benefited from the resources element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The councils of Falkirk district and Central region will be most concerned if it is suggested that their opposition to this legislation is in any way muted by the pure chance that they happen to be treated similarly to some Conservative authorities as a result of the Government's gerrymandering of the resources element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be. My hon. Friend is very properly putting the record straight in regard to his own local authorities. There are local authorities which have undoubtedly benefited from the change. That is inevitable. If there is a change there will be winners and losers. But the vast majority of local authorities in Scotland feel that if there is to be a change it should be managed in a much more gradual manner. They are unhappy at the way it has come down from one to four, if I remember rightly, to one to seven and one to nine. We are still suspicious about the way in which these matters are being managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lothian region, which constantly crops up, has almost, in fact, has reached, the stage where it gets very little out of the resources element, as I understand it. If the Secretary of State continues in his present fashion and reduces the equalisation amount within the rate support grant, he may benefit that particular local authority. I would not necessarily complain about that, but it is, perhaps, a surprising development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point concerns the powers that have been taken in and imported from clause 13 into clause 14 and which are other examples of the way in which local authorities are being stripped of their independence and their discretion fettered, cabined and confined. I do not think that that can be defended under the guise of qualifying the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the local authority have fixed an unnecessarily high rate".</p></blockquote>
I have made a few points. Others may crop up to which I may wish to return, but other members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
Committee may want to join in and, although expressing our strong dissent from the way in which the clarification is taking place, and in which the Secretary of State's powers are being expanded across local government activity, I shall await the Minister's defence with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many respects the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has, by comparing this clause with clause 13, misunderstood much of the purpose and significance and, indeed, much of the effect of clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 deals with the total amount of resources element the aggregate of which is available for local authorities in Scotland. In so far as any local authority might lose any part of its resources element as a result of the application of clause 14, such sums as it might lose will automatically fall, not to the Secretary of State or to the Government, but to be redistributed among other local authorities. That is a fundamental difference between the effects of clause 14 and the effect of clause 13. The effect of clause 13 is that, unless the Secretary of State chose to redistribute that sum, the money would be lost to the local authorities as a whole. From their point of view, that is a less attractive situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel obliged to divide the Committee on this clause. I expected him to do so on the earlier clause, but I would be surprised if he found it necessary on this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns the fair distribution of the total sum available for the resources element. The total sum is determined by the Secretary of State. Once it has been decided, the question arises of whether an individual authority or a minority of authorities are getting an unfair share of that resources element. It they are doing so, they get it not at the expense of the ratepayer or taxpayer, but at the expense of other local authorities. That cannot be avoided unless provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why an authority which was proposing either unnecessarily high spending or excessively high spending gets an unfair share of resources element. It operates as follows—and this explanation answers the hon. Gentleman's question. A local authority's entitlement to resources element is calculated by multiplying the authority's rate poundage by the amount by which its actual penny rate product is less than its standard penny rate product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that we are multiplying the rate poundage of the authority. Therefore, the higher an authority's rate poundage, the greater the amount of resources element it will receive. The local authority is in a beneficial position. It is in control of deciding its own rate poundage, but it can do so in the knowledge that the higher it fixes its rate poundage, the more resources element it will receive. It will receive a larger slice of the available cake and, therefore, less will be available for all the other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fix the sum due to an individual authority by multiplying that authority's rate poundage by the amount by which its actual penny rate product is less than its standard penny rate product. The standard penny rate product is found by multiplying the authority's total population by the national standard amount per head of population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the next question is, how do we determine the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
national standard amount per head of population? The aggregate amount that is available is determined by the Secretary of State when he fixes the needs to resources ratio. But the national standard amount per head is determined by the Secretary of State and it represents the amount that every authority receiving resources element will thereby be enabled to raise for every member of population from a local rate of 1p in the pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe the formula in algebraic terms, which may give the hon Gentleman a chance at his leisure to see how this matter is determined. The formula for the national standard amount applied by successive Governments is the total rateable value divided by the population and multiplied by the rates plus the resources element divided by the total rates. I do not expect the hon. Gentleman to have absorbed that as 1 said it, but he asked how these matters were determined, and they are inevitably complicated. This is not a new formula but the one which has been applied over the years. However, it determines the national standard amount used in the calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister give us a numerical example to illustrate his point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is anxious to have a numerical example, I shall write to him and give him such an example, but he will have to wait.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that one thing at least is abundantly clear to the hon. Member for Garscadden, as it is the point that is relevant to the clause. Because the local authority has the power to determine its own rate poundage, it also has the power to determine the amount of resources element that it receives. It is for that reason, and because a local authority that acted irresponsibly would be acting not only against the national interest but against the interests of all the other local authorities, that clause 14 is before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 allows the Secretary of State, in two sets of circumstances, for purposes of the formula to apply a rate poundage different from that fixed by the local authority in calculating the amount of resources element to which it should be entitled. One basis on which it can do that is found in clause 14(1). The subsection is a rewording of a provision which has been available for many years and which allows a local authority to rate for a sum greater than it needs to carry out its expenditure objectives as indicated by its budget. The provision was in the 1966 Act, and although the wording was slightly different, the objective is the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second provision relates to local authorities which are proposing excessive and unreasonable expenditure. There, too, the rate poundage applied to determine its resource element entitlement can be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that we are seeking to provide a more sophisticated alternative to the means used by my right hon. Friend over the last couple of years of reducing the needs to resources ratio. Because we wished to give encouragement to prudent local authorities and not to allow those acting excessively to benefit directly from the high rates poundage, the slightly crude approach of reducing the needs to resources ratio was taken. In general terms it has benefited authorities, such as the Central region or Falkirk, which have not had an
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
excessively high rate poundage, and has been against the interests of authorities with high rate poundages. It is clearly preferable to have a system which operates more specifically in regard to the authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following with great interest what the Under-Secretary is saying. Do I take it from the general tenor of his remarks that in future we are unlikely to see a substantial change from the present ratio, which has varied greatly in recent years, and that, as a substitute for that if adjustment is needed, these powers will be used? If that is the measure, what puzzles me is why the rather crude method of changing the ratio was used when powers existed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: indicated dissent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that I misunderstand, but under part II of schedule 1 of the 1966 Act the phrase occurs that is excised here:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the local authority have fixed an unnecessarily high rate".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps that lacked a clarification that has been added in terms of the criteria to be applied, but basically the power was there. Why was it not used if this is so much more advantageous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase "unnecessarily high rate" referred to the circumstance in clause 14(1), where the rate being fixed was higher than even the local authority needed to pay for the expenditure that it proposed. If the total proposed expenditure was, say, £100 million, but the rate support grant entitlement plus the rates that the authority was levying would give it £120 million, clearly it would be fixing a rate that provided £20 million more than even its own budget suggested it needed. That is what "an unnecessarily high rate" would have meant. That is the provision under clause 14(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I answer the hon. Gentleman's general point about the needs-resources ratio. If the provisions had been in force over the last two years the reasons that led my right hon. Friend to change the needs-resources ratio would not have existed. Therefore, it is certainly possible that there will be no further change in the ratio. Indeed, there may even be an argument for restoring some of the earlier balance. I do not say that that is what would happen, but the factors which led my right hon. Friend to see no option but to change the ratio would no longer exist with anything like the same force if a much more sensible, sophisticated alternative was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause, therefore, is, without qualification, to ensure that the vast majority of local authorities do not lose out in resources element because one or two authorities are hogging a bigger share than they are entitled to. It is quite different from clause 13. Under clause 13, if a local authority loses RSG, the money goes to the Secretary of State, not to other local authorities. That is a fundamental difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point but, as the Minister will remember, schedule 3 paragraph 8 gives the Secretary of State power to redistribute among other local authorities. I hope that, when we come to that, we shall have assurances, if, as we hope it will not, it comes to the point where money has been clawed back, that those powers will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that at the appropriate time. In terms of the Bill, that must be a purely discretionary matter for the Secretary of State. The important point about clause 14 is that it does not matter one whit what the Secretary of State might like to do with the sums that a local authority might lose in resources element. It will automatically be redistributed to the other local authorities. The Secretary of State's wishes in the matter do not enter into it because the grand sum that is available for resources element would not be changed once the RSG order had been approved by Parliament, and the sums would therefore automatically be redistributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a different situation, where we are anxious to ensure that the vast majority of local authorities do not lose out on resources element simply because one or two authorities may be putting an excessively high rates figure. They may not do so because they wish to obtain more in resources element, but for other reasons. But an inevitable consequence of high rates being fixed is that such authorities get an unfair share of resources element compared to other authorities. It may not be their intention but it is an inevitable and inescapable consequence unless the figure used to determine their own resource element entitlement can be adjusted as the 1966 Act provides and, in this expanded way, as clause 14 of the Bill provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reason for the clause and why I said that I should be surprised if the hon. Gentleman felt obliged to divide the Committee on the clause. Naturally, I expected such action on the earlier clause but, in the light of my explanation, I hope that he will think seriously before dividing on a matter that is quite different from the matters that we have been considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the Under-Secretary. I appreciate that he is trying to convince us that the clause serves merely to clarify the question. Among others, the submission we received from Central region, which has been mentioned several times in the debate as a beneficiary of changes in the needs-resources element split, said that the measure
	<br><blockquote><p>"seeks to clarify the Secretary of. State's power, in calculating the resources element of rates support grant where he considers an unnecessarily high rate has been fixed, to substitute a lower rate by providing reference to section 108 of the 1973 Act."</p></blockquote>
The Director of Administration and Legal Services said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This does not greatly clarify the position and substantial discretion will remain with the Secretary of State in the interpretation and application of the provision."</p></blockquote>
That is one local authority. COSLA, which represents a wider range of views, speaks about the technical aspects. It says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause enables the Secretary of State when calculating the resources element of Rates Support Grant payable to a particular authority to replace the rate poundage actually declared by that authority with a rate poundage which is in his opinion more appropriate. Here again the Secretary of State is taking unto himself arbitrary powers for which there is no justification."</p></blockquote>
COSLA goes on to explain how that has happened over the last three RSG settlements. The last paragraph of COSLA's submission say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed powers are repressive and unnecessary especially when weighed against other powers contained in the Bill. The Clause should, therefore, be deleted from the Bill."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
Central region has benefited in recent years from the shift in that it is very much in the middle. It did not do too well under the Labour rate support grant settlements. But it had a rate base, largely because of Grangemouth, which we shall no doubt refer to under the new clauses. It is because of the rate base that these industrial areas have always done quite well; they have never been short of a few bob in terms of the provision and for other historical reasons which I mentioned in a previous debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that these areas benefit from the new RSG, they are not convinced by what they presume are the Minister's arguments. I should imagine that, had their representatives been here today, they would probably not have been any more impressed than my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and I have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not cite Lothian Region, which one would assume to be against most of the financial provisions in the Bill. I refer to two sources—Central region, which one can say is relatively unbiased, and COSLA, which is nothing if not representative of the views of the authorities of Scotland—neither of which is in great sympathy with the measure. Therefore, for those reasons, if for no other, we can look towards two relatively unbiased sources and say that they were not impressed by the reasoning put forward by the Scottish Office and the discussions which they clearly held prior to the Bill appearing. Once the Bill appeared in its present form, they felt that we would be well advised—I hope that my colleagues take the same view—not to include the clause in the Bill. Assuming that the amendment is defeated, my hon. Friend having pressed it to a Division, I hope that we shall then seek to delete the whole clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I am not clear about why the hon. Gentleman suggests that the Committee should vote against this particular proposition. He has quoted the submission from Central region, and yet that region merely said that in its view the proposal may not clarify the matter as well at the Government might wish. They have made no objection to the principle of clause 14. Indeed, the reference to the Convention does not itself indicate any reason of principle why the Convention should be opposed to such a provision. The hon. Gentleman has not indicated why Central region dislikes what is in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Central region feels that the Secretary of State has far too much discretion. As in so many matters, the local authorities are looking after their own rights and preserves. Although from the point of view of resources Central region could benefit from the way in which RSG works at present, it considers it more important to defend the rights of local authorities and to seek to control and hem in the Secretary of State's discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA's view is quite clear. COSLA considers that the width of the discretion is repressive and unnecessary, especially when other provisions in the Bill are taken into account. The basis of COSLA's opposition is that it does not trust the Secretary of State and so does not wish the Secretary of State to have any more power than he had under the 1966 or the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have also listened with genuine care to what has been said. I should like to reassure the Under-Secretary that, although we shall vote against this change, we do not suffer from the misapprehension that what we are considering is directly comparable to clause 13. I take the Under-Secretary's point that this is a matter of distributing the cake. There is no possibility of the cake being reduced in size, as would be possible under clause 13, although I hope that in practice it would not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like every member of the Committee, I shall be looking for assurances that, if there is any clawback from a local authority's share of RSG, the discretionary powers under schedule 3 under which it could be redistributed among the other authorities will be used by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that clarification is valuable if it makes the position clearer. If it genuinely throws light on how something will work, no one can object to it. But sometimes clarification can be anything but helpful. The English have a very much more sophisticated method of dealing with the resources element. No doubt those who first embarked on stepwise multiple regression analysis thought they were improving the situation. But they have created in England a system which is much more artificial and fractured—much more seriously flawed—than our system in Scotland, although our system has its difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we all want to know how something works. I also accept that the Under-Secretary has said one or two things that are quite interesting. I will read the formulas he has put on the record. I recognise that they are available to those who have been members of the committees that work out such matters. But the layman—and even the unsophisticated political operator such as myself—will no doubt find them enjoyable and improving reading. So, despite your cynicism, Mr. Gourlay, the debate has not been without its uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the new machinery is not just clarification. As the Minister himself went to some lengths to explain, we have imported into the explanation paragraph 2(a)(i) which was already on the statute book. However, paragraph 2(a)(ii) has been added to it, and I understand from what the Under-Secretary of State said that paragraph 2(a)(ii), in this context, is new. Paragraph 2(a)(ii) imports into this procedure the possibility of deeming that a local authority is about to spend in an excessive and unreasonable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, before, we had this somewhat opaque phrase, which I accept was open to argument on interpretation, about the local authority fixing "an unnecessarily high rate". I understand from that argument that this is now equated with paragraph (i)
	<br><blockquote><p>"that they have fixed a rate higher than that required to supply the sufficient moneys mentioned in section 108(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973."</p></blockquote>
If that was all that that was doing, I would agree with the Under-Secretary and not advise my hon Friends to vote against the clause, because that would be merely putting in more precise words what was originally in paragraph 2 of part II of schedule 1 to the 1966 Act. I should have thought that that would have been helpful and would indeed have made the position more explicable to anyone who wanted to follow these interstices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we also have paragraph (ii), which is totally
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
different. It does not say "All right, it is the old criteria made slightly more precise and it is a matter of rating higher than is necessary to meet budget." It is bringing in the subjective test, which must lie entirely with the Secretary of State, that in his view a particular authority is spending excessively and unreasonably. Of course, the Under-Secretary proceeded to make a virtue of the fact that that would allow him to be more selective. So it will. What he will be doing is selecting those authorities which are, in his view, maintaining services of too high a standard to fit easily into his somewhat mean, and restricted view of what public spending totals ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we can all accept that Governments on occasion, because of financial crises, will have to restrict public spending totals. We have been in that situation before, and it would be a brave man who would say that a Labour Government would never been in that situation again. It may well be so, but if the Under-Secretary were fair, he would accept that there is something more fundamental than that in the opposition of such hon. Members as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), and his colleagues on the Government side, to public spending and public services.

I fear that importing paragraph (ii), which is totally new, with all the paraphernalia which we are talking about in clause 13—the total lack of control over the discretion of the Secretary of State—will be used selectively. But selectivity is not in itself a good thing. It was advanced by the Under-Secretary as though that were the end of the argument, that per se selectivity was good. But the trouble is that the merits of selectivity depend on the merits of he who selects, and the criteria by which the selection is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our basic contention is that in the whole climate and attitude of the present Government we suspect that the selection will not be made merely to get a more rational distribution of the resources element, and indeed of the rate support grant as a whole. It will be made in an attempt to ensure that those authorities which are seen as committing the fiscal equivalent of original sin by keeping standards up to a reasonable level are to be penalised in this machinery as they will be penalised under clause 13, as they may no doubt be penalised under clause 23, and as they will be penalised because as district authorities they are not raising their rent levels and so their housing capital allowances will be attacked, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the selector's attitudes are important and we do not like the basis of the Under-Secretary's selectivity. We also fear the criteria, as we have debated for so many weary hours, which are being imported. I think that the Under-Secretary misunderstood me. He thought that I was saying that clauses 13 and 14 contained the same mechanism in terms of intent. I was not, 1 was saying that the criteria in clause 13 were being transferred across into clause 14. For those two substantial reasons 1 must advise my hon. Friends to vote against this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made myself clear-1 do not wish the Under-Secretary to be under any misapprehension about the basis of our opposition. I have put it on the record. 1 am afraid that what he said showed that he had not picked me up clearly enough earlier. On that basis, I invite my hon. Friends to vote against the clause. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments all relate to the timing of the introduction of clauses, in particular clauses 13 and 14. As the Committee will recognise, clause 15 as presently drafted assumes that clauses 13 and 14 will have effect for RSG purposes in the year 1981-82 and for any year thereafter. We had a considerable debate this morning on the stand part debate for clause 13, when I raised the very real timing difficulties. The Under-Secretary replied that, taking clause 13 as an illustration, in a normal year he would hope to have his
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
order for the clawback of funds on the grounds that spending or investments were "excessive and unreasonable" through Parliament by perhaps July in that financial year. I made it clear that I considered that optimistic. Even if he were successful, the effect would be serious. We should already be far into the year, and there would be difficulty in making the cuts to non-statutory services being forced on the local authority concerned—which could not, of course, increase its rates part way through a year—during the remaining part of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister answered, as I could have anticipated, that a provident local authority would recognise that the machinery was in train and would start cutting in anticipation of the inevitable rubber stamping by the well-disciplined payroll vote in the House of Commons. Be that as it may, the point remains valid. It is even more valid in view of the possibilities for the year 1981-82, because my figures were for, say, a year in the future when the machinery was established and the Act was on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The year 1981–82 might show the difficulties in which the Secretary of State could become involved. I do not know how he sees the legislative passage of the Bill—that is, the date on which it is likely to become law—but it will leave Committee in a few weeks. It will then be on Report even though this busy Administration do not give time on the Floor of the House easily. It will then be sent to another place to be considered by their Lordships and, knowing the complexity of the matter and the number of men of skill there, we can assume that some amendments will have to come back to the House of Commons. That is inevitable. Even if things run reasonably smoothly for the Under-Secretary they do not always do so—I do not believe that this Bill will reach the statute book until the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume at that point that, having got the measure safely on to the statute book, the Under-Secretary says "Goody. I can now start to implement the rate support grant for the year 1981-82. I shall therefore clobber wicked local authority A." Let us not presuppose that it is a particular local authority. But it is a real sinner: a sinner unrepentant and shameless which must be cut down by the wrath of the Secretary of State. The Under-Secretary then begins to put in his report and lays his parliamentary order. Therefore, with the best will in the world, I believe that it will be well into the autumn—perhaps into the winter—of the year 1981-82 before he can start his clawback.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Under-Secretary in all seriousness that, if that is so, we shall have retrospective rather than prospective clawback. But, if he is to do anything about the year 1981-82, he must act—it would be more honest and convenient for everyone concerned if he accepted that he must act—under section 5 of the 1966 Act. He would have to act at the end of the year. Those provisions have never been used, but if he is misguided enough to try to act in that way, I think that, as a matter of expediency he will be doing it more or less in the same way. If he does not, he will have all the clawbacks and all the cuts in services to make up the money that he is removing from that local authority telescoped into the last three or four months. I believe that, inevitably, he will find that there is a carry over into the following year. Anyway, it will be physically impossible to make substantial savings in the very short time that is available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a point of principle or a root and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
branch attack on the philosophy of the measure at present. I am telling the Under-Secretary that, given the practicalities of the legislative programme as well as the further legislative steps that must be taken before anything can be done in a year, to say that this should be available for the RSG year 1981-82 is nonsense. I ask him to recognise that by importing into clause 15 the admirable and sensible phraseology that he will find in clause 12 in connection with sections 4 to 9. Therefore, I suggest that clause 15 should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amendments made by sections 13 and 14 of this Act [shall] have no effect as regards any financial year earlier than that immediately subsequent to the financial year in which this Act is passed."</p></blockquote>
That will mean that the Minister may get the Act on to the statute book; it may well become an Act some time in the financial year 1981-82. But, rather than see an undignified scramble with all the justifiable, practtical complaints that will result from it, he should reconcile himself to the fact that these particular provisions will roll cumbersomely into operation in 1982-83. We have waited a long time for this change, which we do not think is necessary. Not only is it not necessary; it is fundamentally a bad proposal. But even if we leave aside that proposition, it would be better to give it a clean start by ensuring that when it is first used—if used it is—a full financial local government year stretches ahead so that … it can be put into effect at leisure and with some chance not of good will—because it is a punitive sanction of the most miserable sort—but of being effected in an administratively tidy way and with a measure of efficiency. I am a generous man, and I am giving the Under-Secretary a choice of two admirable amendments—Nos. 106 and 107—which are addressed to the same argument. He should accept them in the spirit in which they are offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of your grouping of the amendments, Mr. Gourlay, which I know is for the Committee's convenience, we are considering not only amendments Nos. 106 and 107 but amendments Nos. 108, 109 and 110, which refer to clause 16. They are on the same lines and can be defended in much the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 deals with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Failure of local authority to supply information timeously."</p></blockquote>
"Timeously" is an ugly word. I have always had difficulty in pronouncing it, which merely underlines its ugliness. I think that the provision has been introduced—although it is not specifically confined to clauses 13 and 14—with an eye on some local authority that intended to default on its need to provide the information that would allow the Secretary of State to judge whether expenditure was excessive and unreasonable. This is a paving clause to allow the punitive penalty under clause 13 to be applied at the whim of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My arguments on the amendments referring to clause 15 and the suggestion that it should not operate in 1981-82 largely hold for clause 16. The clauses are morally, if not technically, linked. Therefore, it would be better if they both took effect in the year 1982-83 and not 1981-82.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 seeks to make the simple substitution of 1982-83 for 1981-82. Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 are the equivalent of amendment No. 106, which applies to clause 15. They seek to ensure that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
provision will come into force in the financial year
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsequent to the financial year in which this Act is passed".</p></blockquote>
There is no point in speaking at great length on these matters. The intention is clear to the Committee. The practical reasons for it are stark. We often hear that the Conservative Party is made up of men of business—practical men who are not perhaps too nice about the philosophical rights and wrongs but who know a spade when they see one. Well, this has nothing to do with spades, but it has a lot to do with practical local government efficiency. if we are to go in for this type of nonsense, we might at least try to do it in a reasonably businesslike manner. These modest amendments will do something to help achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 can say "as soon as possible", but it is not entirely a matter for me to decide. It is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House in regard to the subsequent stages of the Bill and for another place to determine in its handling of the Bill. Therefore, it is not possible for me to give a firm date, but the Government's view is that the Bill should go forward as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not necessary for the Secretary of State to await the Royal Assent before considering the budgets of local authorities. As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, the circular sent to local authorities last week not only asked for details of the budget but made it clear that it would be scrutinised on the basis of the Secretary of State's intention. Indeed, that was made clear in the RSG order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time the Bill receives the Royal Assent, the Secretary of State will be in a position to indicate right away whether he intends to use these powers and, if so, against which authorities. All that will be required at that stage is consultation with the local authority. Once that consultation has taken place, either the Secretary of State will be persuaded to drop his proposals or, if he is not, it will simply depend on when my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House can find time to debate the appropriate orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's suggestions about excessive delay—months here and months there—do not hold much water. Even if they did, they are not a terribly persuasive argument in the circumstances. His objection seemed at one stage to be that, if such an order applied only towards the end of this year, it would be almost retrospective. That might be true, but it would compare with the existing provisions in the Labour Government's Bill, which would be entirely retrospective, because they can be used only after the year in which the local authority has incurred the expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
Therefore, under the Labour Government's Bill, a local authority would be required to make reductions in its spending in a subsequent year because of overspending in a year which had since been completed. In this Bill, the retrospective aspect either will not be present or, at the very least, will be far more modified as a result of these provisions than it would under the provisions of the Labour Government's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying when we were so rudely interrupted by bells afar, the Minister misunderstood the point that I was making. He suggested that it was better to be almost retrospective than to be clearly retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, as I understand the distinction—I may have this wrong, so it is worth airing the point-the new machinery envisaged in clause 13 is a clawback of rate support grant for the year in which the clawback is ordered—in other words, if the adjudged excessive expenditure is for the year 1981-82, the clawback has to be in 1981-82. The difference with the other machinery is that it would be judged that the expenditure had been excessive in the year 1981-82 and the rate support grant for 1982-83 would be hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be illogical—we could argue at length about the good sense of these proceedings—but it is clearly a different matter. I am arguing that it would be much better to accept that the whole point of the new procedure, if it has virtue at all, is that the penalty will fall upon the year in which the expenditure has been excessive. In such circumstances, in order to do that conveniently and efficiently, one has to get off to a flying start, so to speak. One has to get the machinery rolling early in the financial year, not almost half way, or perhaps more than half way, through it, which is inevitable in 1981-82. That is the year we are discussing. Whatever speculation we may make about Royal intentions or Royal Assent, with the best will in the world there will be a long delay before Her Majesty can consider an Act that is ready for her assent, because of the stages that I outlined. Let us make the penalty fall in the right year, but let it be the whole year so that it can be done sensibly, which means waiting until 1982-83.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point made by the hon. Gentleman, but the Secretary of State made it abundantly clear that, if these provisions were necessary, it would be the forthcoming year to which they would apply. Local authorities have been aware of that ever since the Bill was published. In any event, at this point we have no reason to believe that it should not be possible this year to submit an order to Parliament, if one is required, at approximately the same time as will apply in subsequent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has given various estimates of when Royal Assent might be received. Clearly we do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
know that, but the date of round about June or July as the time when an order could be submitted to Parliament may not be possible. Even if that is not so, I must repeat that I believe that an order that was submitted in October or November would—given that the financial year runs to the following April—still be preferable to the retrospective nature of the present provisions which penalise the year which is not the same as that in respect of which the penalty has been exerted. So, compared with the status quo, I feel that this is an improvement, but I accept that there may be a difference of view on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that statement, why are we meeting tonight in our second session today of what is now our third sitting?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I should comment on that now. I merely say to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We remain resolutely unconvinced about the merits of the Minister's case. I will probably creep up behind him some time about July and say "I told you so", because I do not believe that his optimism about the passage of the Bill is justified. We are now locked in Committee stage. I agree that we have broken the back of the Bill, but we still have some way to go. There are many stages to go through, and another House through which the Bill must wend its way—and there is nothing that Members of another place like better than complicated local government Bills of this kind. I can see my noble Friend Lord Ross of Marnock literally licking his chops at the approach of this juicy morsel. I see no reason to think that the Bill will go through the upper House quickly, quite apart from what will happen when it returns here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point, but the statement that there is no reason why the parliamentary order required for authority for a clause 13 deduction should not be laid in 1981-82 at about the same time that it would be laid in any other year, strikes me as extremely surprising. On reconsideration, I think that the Under-Secretary would find that a somewhat rash prediction that he would be rather hard put to defend in a more lengthy debate than we are allowing ourselves the luxury of this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would prefer that 1981-82 be struck out. I cannot pretend that anything will give a fair wind and good will to these clauses, but I think that there will be at least a realisation that our amendment was a gesture towards making it a little more workable and giving the provision a platform on which a modus vivendi could be worked out on the technicalities of clauses 13 and 14.

However, if the Under-Secretary is set in his ways, it is not for me to spend many a long weary hour trying to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have objected consistently to the amount of discretion given to the Secretary of State. If certain powers have to be given to the Secretary of State, we feel that there ought to be controls on them. The purpose of the amendment, quite simply, is to ensure that, if a local authority feels that it is being imposed upon unfairly by the Secretary of State, in the sense that the Secretary of State wishes to hurry along in an unreasonable manner the local authority which is seeking to present its budgets, the clause should make provision for the courts to consider what is a reasonable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not so fastidious as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on the pronunciation of the word "timeously", but however it is pronounced, we feel that the expression is inadequate in itself, and that it is desirable that there should be some check on the power the Secretary of State is taking to himself. I believe that it is about time that the Under-Secretary started to make one or two concessions. We have been battered into the ground by the silent majority on the Government benches and at this late hour we ask, in the phrase used by my hon. Friend the other day, for some crumb from the dictator's table. It would certainly give local authorities some small crumb of comfort in the sense that it is not solely at the behest of the Secretary of State that the arrangements for the treatment of their accounts or budgets be considered. Therefore, in respect of the first amendment, we would prefer that the phrase "given timeously" be withdrawn and replaced in a reasonable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the second amendment, the usefulness of the Controller of Audit's publication and work was mentioned by my hon. Friend today in testimony to the valuable information provided by that body and its staff. Certainly, we feel that this body, which is held in high esteem by those in local authorities and in some respects can be regarded as an independent referee or arbiter, could be called in. On the basis of its investigations, the Secretary of State could satisfy himself as to the excessiveness or unreasonableness of the pattern of the expenditure to be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
These are not attempts to slow down the process. In the first instance, we simply suggest that a clearer definition be provided of the word "timeously". Secondly, in the case of the information, that it be not quite audited but overlooked by the Controller of Audit, because we know that the Scottish Development Agency or whichever part of the St. Andrew's House warren will have responsibility for these investigations are very much regarded as the creatures of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a climate of opinion which I think will be soured by the confrontations that may well ensue, it would be better if there were some more neutral investigator appointed. As I said earlier, at present the Controller of Audit is an individual who enjoys the respect of many of those in local government. While not wishing for one moment to deflect any of the justified opprobrium which the legislation will create away from the Minister, nevertheless, in order to try to improve relations with local government, which will inevitably deteriorate as the legislation gains momentum—regardless of when it receives the Royal Assent—we are happy to debate them together as they are concerned with the same considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many of those most likely to be severely affected by the legislation are in our party, we would like to think that in local government there may be one or two aspects of this wretched legislation which will cause less aggro than would otherwise be the case. It is not for us to encourage confrontation in the political system in a purely destructive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the two amendments will help good relations within the community and within the Scottish political system. We ask the Minister to think seriously about this at this late hour, and to make, for the first time in days, a meaningful concession to prove to us that the reasonableness which some of us were prepared to attribute to him has not disappeared completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the amendment timeously, and say to the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) that, while I am always anxious to be as conciliatory as I can, I can assure him that the two amendments are unnecessary and inappropriate. I can deal with the matter briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "timeously" means within the time that was specified. The provision refers especially to section 199 of the 1973 Act, under which the Secretary of State requires a local authority to provide information. Section 199 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority … shall, within such period as the appropriate Minister may require"</p></blockquote>
provide the necessary information. So the clause comes into effect only when the Minister, using section 199, has indicated a specific time by which the information is to be provided. If the local authority has not responded within that time, it means that it has not responded timeously. "Timeously", therefore, has a specific meaning—it is not a general or vague meaning. It refers specifically to the time that the Secretary of State indicated when he made a requirement under section 199 of the 1973 Act. It would therefore be meaningless, having indicated a specific time, to accept

	<br><blockquote><p>"after due investigation and consultation with the local authority."</p></blockquote>
On reflection, I think, the hon. Member will appreciate that it would be contrary to the purpose of the provision, because we are dealing with a situation where local authorities fail to supply the information. There is no reason why, a local authority should be unable to provide the information. If it has failed to provide it, it is because it does not wish to do so. It is seeking deliberately to avoid making the information available to the Secretary of State. Given that that is the only circumstance in which a local authority could conceivably refuse to provide such information, it would be pointless to seek to remedy that by providing for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Controller of Audit after due investigation and consultation with the local authority,"</p></blockquote>
because, if the local authority wished to avoid making this information available, it would be no more prepared to co-operate with the controller than it would with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that any local authority which does not wish to see the provision applied simply provides the information, as is its obligation under section 199 of the 1973 Act. This is not a new provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must obviously be some machinery if a local authority, in default, refused to comply with its obligations. If the Secretary of State simply used the normal default powers, he would possibly have to wait months before use of the powers could be considered. That clearly would be absurd given the basis upon which the clause is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, with that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will accept that one of his amendments is totally unnecessary, given the specific meaning of "timeous". His second amendment would be completely contrary to any sensible interpretation of the clause and, for that reason, could not be recommended to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the Under-Secretary has said and I have some sympathy with his point about the amendment concerning the word "timeously". I think his reference to section 199 of the 1973 Act was fair. It might have been better done when these amendments were "manuscripted". I considered whether it might not be better to try to lay down some minimum time limit which would ensure that a local authority had a reasonable opportunity of gathering information without running the risk of falling foul of section 16. I concluded that it would be too difficult to get the right period and that, therefore, an amendment should be tabled which would allow us to draw attention to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly there is some alarm. We have received representations from COSLA about the supply of information and the hon. Gentleman will have seen the COSLA document. The point is well expressed in the opening statement on clause 13, which says:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new powers strike at the very heart of local democracy"</p></blockquote>
we have heard that phrase before and it echoes round these hallowed chambers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and enable the Secretary of State on the basis of criteria which are both vague and at the same time virtually limitless to impose on local authorities his own largely ill-informed views".</p></blockquote>
That expresses the local authorities' anxiety. The paper goes on to argue that sometimes the difficulty in producing information is the fault of the Scottish Office and not the local authority concerned. Page 3 says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local Authority budgets are based to a certain extent on information supplied by government departments e.g. capital allocations. The protracted delay in reaching this year's Rate Support Grant settlement does not encourage local authorities to think that they will at all times be in possession of all the relevant information which we will enable them to submit information timeously. It is also difficult to envisage how the Secretary of State without knowledge of the facts pertaining to an authority can make an estimate which has any bearing on the true needs of that authority."</p></blockquote>
That leads me from the first point, which is that sometimes a local authority is not in a position to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, if the local authority was able to provide a credible explanation as to why the information could not be provided timeously, the Secretary of State would not wish to use the powers provided under this clause. We were talking about the situation where a local authority, without providing a proper explanation, refuses or fails to provide the necessary information. If that is the assurance which the hon. Gentleman requires, I am happy to give it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I do not require it, but I draw the Committee's attention to the fears expressed by COSLA, which is a representative and respectable reflection of local authority opinion. Sometimes the Under-Secretary sounds reproachful of the points made and gives the impression that all is well in the Tory world and that all is well in the best of all possible worlds. Anyone with half an eye can see that that is a gloss which has no foundation. He ought to recognise the reality of these objections, but I am grateful for that assurance and I hope that we will never need to remind him of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendment relates to the last part of the quotation which I have just read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also difficult to envisage how the Secretary of State without knowledge of the facts pertaining to an authority can make an estimate which has any bearing on the true needs of that authority."</p></blockquote>
I think that it is genuinely felt that if the Secretary of State moves in and, under clause 16, says "We shall make estimates and deem them to be information given by the local authority", the Secretary of State is, by definition, having a quarrel with that local authority and is becoming judge and jury in his own cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman surely appreciates that the Secretary of State is entitled to use these powers only if the local authority has failed to provide the information. If it has provided that information, there is no way in which he is entitled to use any estimates.

	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
Therefore, if a local authority deliberately decides not to provide the information it can hardly complain that the Secretary of State is forced back to using his own estimates, when his power to do so is simply as a consequence of its refusing to comply with the terms of section 119 of the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds to me like estimated gas bills and income tax assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees. He will accept that a lot of people become angry about that kind of process and that kind of shotgun method of obtaining information and action. I accept the point that he will make, that morally there can be no complaint because the local authority is a sinner and is refusing to co-operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be those who will argue that the provisions of clause 13 are so noxious as will justify non-cooperation in a statutory requirement. That is the sort of danger that gives force to the argument; it is one of the unpleasant byproducts of legislation such as this. It is because I think that the maximum reassurance is needed that I would have thought that at least it was worth considering. I put it no higher than that. We will not press this point, but at least it is worth considering whether we need independent scrutiny by someone with the independent status of the Controller of Audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there is a commission to which the Controller of Audit is answerable. I think Tom Fraser used to be the chairman, but I think that the chairman now is a Tory farmer—a Mr. Munro—with whom I am not familiar. But I think that the Controller of Audit, whatever the political complexion of the commission, has an impeccable reputation. If the figures are to be accurate, there is some virtue in independent scrutiny of the kind envisaged in this amendment. We keep throwing the Under-Secretary of State lifelines, and he keeps throwing them back. That is very misguided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Depressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as my hon. Friend has said. I approach the end of this sitting with a slight feeling of sad anti-climax, because the Under-Secretary of State looks fixedly at all the amendments and produces arguments which have some force to suggest that they are not strictly necessary. The point is that they would all help to improve the climate. We would like him to think between now and Report on whether some of our suggestions might not be imported into the Bill, particularly the one in regard to timing, to give some gesture of good will to a local authority world which is, he may think, neurotic, but which most of us would think was tortured by genuine doubts about the intention of the Government and their approach to local authority independence. This is another example of the way in which he could go some way without, in fact, selling the pass on his principal aim, giving reassurance that this new machinery will be operated in a civilised, proper, and as constructive a manner as its noxious substance allows. I hope that at least the Under-Secretary of State will not continue with a closed mind.
