	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 66, in page 4, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>g</i>) on a request to that effect made to them at any time by a parent of a child supply the parent with information about the choice of course available to the child within any school under their management and, if the parent and child opt for a course within the school attended by the child, then the child shall have the right to be admitted to that course.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 70, in page 4, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>g</i>) make available for inspection by the parents of a pupil or by the pupil, if a young person, attending a school under their management the pupil's progress record and all other records or information in their possession concerning the pupil and the education authority shall have the duty of rectifying any false information in the pupil's progress record.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I now reply to Thursday afternoon's debate on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving amendment No. 48, the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) returned to the question of including examination results in the information to be made available to parents to help them choose a school. I have little to add to what has already been said in the Committee on this question. The Government—and, I think, the Committee—recognise that the results should be presented in a way that does not disadvantage one area or school in comparison with another. That is why the Government have laid before the Committee the consultative document on information for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be assisted in the presentation of examination results by two things. First, there is the nature of the Munn and Dunning proposals and the assessment
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
on three levels—foundation, general and credit—which will provide a more broadly based view of a child's performance. I think that the number of Munn and Dunning places taken in a school will itself be a guide to parents and to others as to the population and general academic performance of that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Scottish certificate of education examination board is currently considering a factual report on post-16 examinations. Clearly, that will include consideration of the credit level in the Munn and Dunning proposals and its effect on the Scottish certificate of education. We can feel fairly certain that SCEEB will wish to consider the effect of the credit level on the SCE and to make suggestions for the future. I believe that I can assure the Committee that everyone concerned with providing information for parents intends that this important information about examinations should be presented in a way that is acceptable to the large majority of people both inside and outside the field of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said that assessments should be made in context. That is precisely what we are trying to achieve by issuing a consultative paper on the subject and by trying to make sure that parents who wish to make a choice of school for their children are provided not just with information but with relevant information. Under amendment No. 66, the parent would have the right to be supplied with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"information about the choice of course available to the child within any school",</p></blockquote>
and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the parent and child opt for a course within the school attended by the child, then the child shall have the right to be admitted to that course."</p></blockquote>
I shall consider first the proposal that an education authority should give a parent information about courses available at any of its schools. We are anxious that the fullest possible information should be made available to parents. I believe that that information should include information on the courses on offer at any school, but I do not believe that, on the question of courses within schools, main legislation is appropriate. As the Committee knows, we have issued for comment a consultative paper setting out our proposals for regulations under new section 28B. Paragraph 12 of that paper suggests that the information to be supplied about any school on request should include
	<br><blockquote><p>"the range and level of curriculum provided for pupils of different ages: subject options and choices available and arrangements for parents to be consulted about such choices".</p></blockquote>
The hon Gentleman can therefore be assured that this will be a matter covered by the regulations, but I would prefer to wait for comment on the consultative paper before deciding precisely the terms in which the information should be defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second part of the amendment, I do not accept that because a parent opts for his child to be admitted to a particular course as a result of the information he receives, it follows that the education authority automatically should be required to accede to that request. This takes no account of the possibility that there might be more applicants for a course than there was room for. Where such a case arises it will be for authorities to decide the priorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
for admission to the course. This is essentially a matter for school management, and we cannot legislate for every aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While, therefore, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment, as the hon Member has already mentioned, we are proposing to repeal section 28(2) of the 1980 Act, and this strengthens the position of parents by removing the barrier to the selection of a course from which, in the authority's opinion, the pupil is unlikely to profit. This is a considerable step forward in helping parents with school and with any involvement they may wish to have in courses within a school. The repeal of this provision must strengthen the position of parents with regard to choice of course. I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister said about the repeal of part of the existing legislation which precludes parents' right to choose a particular course for a child. Would it not be better to replace the part of the existing legislation which he intends to repeal with a more positive approach, to give parents more rights? It is claimed that the Bill extends the rights of parents and gives them more freedom of choice in the education of their children. In resisting the amendment the Minister is going against his declared philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, though I appreciate the point that the hon Gentleman is making. First, requires a delicate balance of judgment on the part of parent as to whether his child is capable of taking, for instance, an O-grade mathematics course if the school does not think that it is the right course for the child. It might be argued, with due respect to parents—and most of us here are parents—that teachers are likely to be more objective than parents as to the child's ability to take an O-grade mathematics course. Occasionally we hear of cases where parents feel that their child is not being given an opportunity, when on an objective view of the evidence the conclusion might be rather different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon Gentleman asked for something more positive in the Act. Removing an inhibition on parental choice—although nothing is going in its place—is a positive step. I believe that this goes as far as it is necessary to go to ensure that there is no unnecessary fettering of the steps that a parent might take to try to satisfy himself that his child is being given every opportunity for a choice of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend accept that there is another, completely opposite, way to look at this matter? There are some situations in which the parent and child do not wish to pursue the course, and that in the opinion of the teacher, is wrong. I was at an engagement party the other week. The young lady getting engaged was informing her friends that she had got higher mathematics only because I had refused to allow her to drop the subject. It is, therefore, not only a matter of teachers not allowing children into a course; it is also their professional duty not to allow them out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a splendid example—especially my hon Friend's reference to professional duty. Teachers are professionals who have to make judgments. Having done so, they should be able to use persuasion rather than legislation to achieve the end, whether, as my hon Friend rightly says, they are persuading a child to take a course or not to do so. I would say to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) that the legislation is much improved in the interests of parents by the removal of this provision and, therefore, of this inhibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 68, in the name of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire, would require education authorities to provide parents
	<br><blockquote><p>"on a request … with information about the policy on the use of corporal punishment in any school",</p></blockquote>
and would give them the right to withdraw their children from corporal punishment, at the same time depriving teachers of their common law right to impose moderate corporal punishment on children under their charge. I am sure that the hon Gentleman, as a schoolteacher, is aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the duty to provide information about an authority's policy on corporal punishment, the suggestion is premature, because it anticipates one of the proposals in the consultative paper on information to parents, which is before the Committee. The paper proposes in paragraph 12(h) that when an authority proposes to place a child in a particular school it will 'automatically be required to supply the parent with information on, among other things, the school policy on discipline, which can often be a very important factor in a parent's choice of school. It is not only a matter of academic choice. Often the regime in a school—a tight discipline or a progressive regime—may attract a parent as much as anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parent will know, from the information made available by the local authority, the policy on discipline, and corporal punishment would usually be included in that. Therefore, the first part of the amendment is already covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the regulations are not very specific as to the areas of discipline about which parents will be given information, and the detail of that information. Would the Minister be in favour of corporal punishment league tables in the same way as he is in favour of examination result league tables, so that parents may compare school A with school B—saying "This school is violent; that school is not so violent"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Opposition who want to devalue, not only examination results, but the examinations themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have confirmation that the Opposition do not believe in examinations at all. If they had their way people would not only go through school Without examinations, but they could go to university, spend a few years learning how to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
be a dentist or a doctor, and then inflict their so-called knowledge on an innocent public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish whether the Opposition have no interest whatever in examinations, because if one is not interested in examination results, I think that it is implied that one is not interested in examinations at all. Therefore, there is a wide gulf between the two sides of the Committee on this important matter. Yet again the Opposition have proved that they do not listen to their constituents but follow a dogma that has little to do with improving the quality of education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a remarkable idea that we wish to abolish examinations because we believe that at present they are overvalued and should therefore be slightly devalued. That is not logical. Many believe that the pound should be devalued, but that does not mean that they wish to abolish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know about slippery slopes. The hon Member's constituents in Scotland will be interested to know that his party wishes to devalue and possibly to eliminate examinations to produce another form of favouritism which they believe would be sufficient for children. We take the opposite view. We believe that examinations are important. As we have often said, a measure of their importance is to ensure that information about examinations is available to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the amendment concerning corporal punishment and parental choice. Does .the Minister believe that difficulties can occur if corporal punishment is applied 100 per cent, throughout a local authority area—in other words, when no provision is made for parents who might object in principle to corporal punishment? It is a matter of getting the balance right, but it seems that, if all schools exercised the right to use corporal punishment the system in some areas might not allow parental choice in relation to the upbringing of their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for bringing up that important point. That is one of the reasons why choice of school should mean more than choice of local authority. We want to achieve the maximum amount of versatility among our schools in respect of syllabus, specialisation within it, sport and discipline, which includes corporal punishment. One of the most important factors for many parents when choosing a school is its discipline. They may believe that a harsh regime and corporal punishment are beneficial, so they must be free to choose a school within their own education area that provides that discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, however, parents may prefer a more liberal regime, where there is no corporal punishment. Therefore, I hope that when education authorities provide information they will allow distinctions to be made on all these matters between one school and another. I believe that that was the point that the hon Gentleman was interested in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point concerns parental choice and human rights. I do not object to corporal punishment in schools, but I know .that some parents do not agree with me. Therefore, I ask the Minister how he will achieve the change that he has in mind. Otherwise the rights of some parents will be adversely affected and, for that reason, I may vote for the amendment of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). But there is the question of how ideas about wider choice can be imposed on democratic education authorities that might not wish to adopt them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that choice should be available between schools. But, it is a different matter if a parent wants to opt his children out the regime of a particular school. Some schools use the belt while others do not. Some use it only in the most serious circumstances, and there are all sorts of degrees in between. That is right and proper. In providing information for parents, and in providing parental choice, we are anxious to ensure that parents are fully aware of the type of discipline as between one school and another, so that those who want to take that aspect into account will be free to do so. We believe that the consultative paper, information and the legislation, which we are studying in Committee, all go towards schools being able to be different from one another. Most importantly, parents will be made aware of those differences when exercising their freedom of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the hon Gentleman's amendment is premature and, in addition, would require much wider consultation. The amendment proposes that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the parent shall have the right to insist that corporal punishment be not given to the child."</p></blockquote>
As the hon Gentleman probably knows, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities set up a working party on alternatives to corporal punishment under the chairmanship of Councillor Dr. Malcolm Green of Strathclyde who is the chairman of its education committee. The working group includes representatives of parents and .teachers and has commissioned a study of schools Where corporal punishment is used and of others where it is seldom or never used. The working group has already made its interim report, but before it frames a final report, with recommendations, further work and study is being carried out in some of the schools originally studied, and in additional schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group hopes to report to the Secretary of State, probably by the late summer and certainly by the end of the year. Unless the Secretary of State and interested parties have had an opportunity of considering the report it would be premature to push ahead with a proposal such as the hon Gentleman sets out in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the hon Gentleman's amendment would also deprive teachers of their common law right to administer moderate corporal punishment. That would be a major step, and, in fairness to both parents and the teaching profession, it would have to be the subject of wider consultation. I am sure that the hon Gentleman is aware of the steps currently being taken on these serious and im-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
portant matters. I hope that by the end of this year we shall he able to make some decisions, once we have benefited from the advice of parents, teachers, local authorities and others concerned with these matters. A matter related to corporal punishment is an interim report on responsibilities and duties of parents by a working group of COSLA. Copies of that report are available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I must advise the hon Member for West Stirlingshire that his amendment is premature, and I do not recommend that it should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70, also tabled by the hon Member, would insert a requirement to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make available for inspection by the parents of a pupil or by the pupil … the pupil's progress record and all other records or information in their possession concerning the pupil".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would give parents an automatic right of access to records about their child held by schools. Paragraph . 12 of our consultative paper setting out our proposals for regulations under new section 28B suggests that the information that parents should have would include a right to ask about individual schools and should include the school's arrangements for assessing pupils' progress and reporting this to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman, as a former school teacher, will be aware of the well-known arguments against making such records available as of right, particularly the need to express professional assessment in terms which might be open to misunderstanding by lay people. Therefore, I should not wish to rush into implementing such a provision without first considering fully the implications of any comments made on this issue by the bodies that have been invited to submit views on the paper. It is a sensitive matter, and teachers, in order to be able to make their assessments confidently and in confidence, would not wish their assessment of children to be a matter of public record. That might be a source of more confusion and misunderstanding than assistance to parents. This is certainly a delicate matter, on which full and proper consultation is required before any further action is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate my remarks on the amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), but I should like to comment briefly on the Minister's reply to amendment No. 66 on parental choice of courses within a school. He said that the local authority and the professionals were best able to take the decisions and to judge whether children should take one course or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the classic case against parental choice between schools. That is what we have said all along. We say that the local authority should retain at least some power to take such decisions in terms of schools. To 90 or 95 per cent, of the school population, however, it will be the choices within the school that matter most; only a small percentage will take advantage of the provisions on freedom of choice between schools. It therefore seems to me that we should be concentrating more on the rights
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
of parents to choose within the school than on choice between schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of examinations. The Minister was trying to sneer at what we said about examinations. I do not care whether the Minister thinks that I am right or wrong. In my view, examinations—particularly external examinations in the Scottish system and to some extent throughout the whole British education system—are overvalued. Too much emphasis is placed upon them already, and as a result of this part of clause 1 an even higher valuation will be placed upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our society relies far too heavily upon external examinations. Children take the examinations on one day after four, five or six years of secondary school life. Whatever happens to them on that day will have a major effect on their whole future careers. We should not have such a system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's memory of presenting in the Scottish State sector may not be all that it might be. There is an appeals procedure. There are preliminary examinations. If a child does markedly worse in the examination than the teacher predicted, there is a mechanism through which he may appeal. The hon Gentleman does not have experience of the State system in Scotland. My experience is that the Scottish certificate of education examination board looks very favourably on appeals. My experience is that, so long as the basis of the appeal is good and the evidence is good, the appeal on a pupil who does markedly worse on the day than the teacher would have expected will be upheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, when I have developed my argument further. Under our system in Scotland—and probably throughout Western Europe—examinations become all-important. The secondary schools are not genuine educational establishments for all children; they are sieves—sifting systems—to sift out those whom universities, colleges and employers wish to take. What the schools are doing is a job not necessarily of educating children, but of selecting people for other establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that schools and school teachers would not wish this to be the case, but it is a fact. Who were the major objectors to the Dunning report? It was the universities in Scotland, not for the same reasons as I or others had, but because they thought that we were moving to a system in which it would be difficult for them to select those whom they wanted for their courses. In other words, they are expecting schools to do their job of selection by operating an external examination system, which allows universities to opt out of that task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

To illustrate what I mean, if a Michelangelo were to emerge from a school in Scotland—one of the most 'brilliant artists for generations who could paint, sculpt, and so on—and he had failed higher English, he would not be allowed to enter a Scottish college of art</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is largely true. I have examined the qualifications for entry into art colleges because, again, I served on a committee considering assessment. I could tell a story which may be apocryphal but is almost certainly true. The example is right. There is a General Teaching Council in Scotland. We are reaching the point where further education lecturers will be obliged to register with that GTC Anyone entering the system is advised that he should take teacher training before taking up a lecturing post. I am told that on one occasion, two lecturers from England applied to go to Jordanhill to take the course. They were to take up posts in a Scottish further education college, but were refused entry on the basis that they did not have higher English in their degrees or school certificates. One was a doctor and one an MSc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of this solid reliance upon examination results, the whole school system has been distorted. We require a movement towards the assessment of children, rather than their examination results. Schools have a better idea of children's capabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who tried to tell a university that all the papers produced by its students should be marked by someone outside that university, would soon hear what it had to say. The Minister has made great play of the professional ability of teachers. Why can we not rely in Scotland upon the professional ability of school teachers to assess their pupils? They are the right ones to do it and not teachers from another school. Let us be clear: the marking of pupils' examination papers is done almost entirely by school teachers, but never by those from the school which the pupils attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such emphasis is to be placed upon professional, judgment in regard to choice—the ability of children to take a course or not—why is there no right to assess children? The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) insisted that a child did higher maths. If he has the ability to judge that a child is capable of doing higher maths, why is he not given the right to assess the child's ability throughout, so that in the end he can say "In my view that child is capable" and can make an assessment of the Child within the school system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now understand the hon Gentleman's argument. It is not that he is against examination certificates. He is against the way in which the conclusion is reached as to how well the child has done. Therefore—if I understand him correctly—he is proposing that there should be a series
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
of examinations, to be called assessments instead of examinations. Will he accept that that is just as difficult for pupils psychologically as the one-off examination? It is certainly more difficult for teachers, because it interferes more with their teaching, as they would have to spend a lot of time assessing and marking and building up files on which to base their conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that that is what the hon Gentleman wants. He is not against external examinations—highers and O-grades or Munns and Dunnings—but simply wants to have internal rather than external assessments. Will he accept that one great problem is that organisations from the universities downwards may decide that they do not like the assessments and—as has happened in some places—may decide to set their own examinations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest single danger would be that pupils would be faced with a multiplicity of examinations for different career opportunities. The school examination prevents that proliferation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course assessment creates extra work for teachers. I am not sure that it creates greater pressure for the children once they are aware of the system and the assessment is over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman appears to be misinterpreting what I am saying. It is an assessment not just of a child's academic ability that is required, but of the child's range of abilities in many areas. That should be taken into account. There may be some dangers in what the hon Member proposes. It has happened already to some extent in some comprehensive secondary schools which have to assess children coming from the primary schools. The move to comprehensive education has been beneficial all round, but one of the biggest benefits has been seen in the primary school, because the removal of the examination pressure from the primary schools has allowed genuine experimentation in terms of curricula and the way in which they operate. Primary schools are now happier, freer and easier places because of the removal of that pressure. Examinations probably cannot be avoided completely in secondary schools, but it would be a good thing if the present emphasis on examinations could be devalued, and the amendment would assist in that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final technical point. The Minister made great play of the fact that, if the Munn and Dunning proposals were implemented, all examination results would be across the board, and all pupils would take the examinations and therefore publication would be less important, but the clause as at present worded refers to external examinations. At least in the foundation course there has been a move under Dunning towards internal assessments and examinations. Will the clause cover foundation courses, because they are not entirely external examinations? Will the school be able to publish the results under the Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The arguments on examination results have been fully rehearsed, but when our examination system is being reviewed, with the likelihood of ultimate radical alteration, there will be considerable amount of confusion about the course content, methods of assessment and, perhaps even more importantly, about the methods of moderation. If there were to be a system of school-based assessment, which is implicit in some of the Minister's remarks, there must be a support system of moderation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not take the point made by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) that the teachers would have extra work. I think that he will agree that a teacher who is doing his job has a process of continuous assessment and is keeping records and those records in some cases only need to be formalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people consider a school's internal assessment procedures, which are going to be an integral part of the ultimate judgment, whether it be a mixture of internal and external, the moderation procedure will require a great deal of effort and money. I know from the experience of my wife, who was a moderator with the Northern examination board which sets the CSE mode 3 courses—which are not dissimilar from the courses which the Scottish certification of education examination board has in mind—that the form of moderation was, to say the least, somewhat haphazard. It caused some disquiet among teachers. It points to the way that we should not go if such a course as proposed were to be adopted. We must take on board the fact that the system of assessment of pupil performance would undergo change from the time examination results were published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week we were accused of being obsessed with league tables. The day before we even discussed the issue, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> headlined an article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Plans for league tables in school results".</p></blockquote>
"League table" was not a phrase coined by any hon Member in Committee because it was common currency anyway, but the press has latched on to it and will be dealing with it in that way. Because of the number of safeguards for an examination system, which is undergoing change about which there will be confusion even within the teaching profession, we think that there is not a strong case for publishing examination results which, as has already been said, will lead to an undue emphasis being placed on the performance of not necessarily the majority of pupils, and will, in some respects, distort the functions and purposes of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister referred to amendment No. 66 he was being a little ingenuous when he said that parents would insist that their children study O-grade courses for which they were not suited. In most schools there is a fairly flexible regime regarding the parental choice of courses. Normally, a compromise can be arrived at whereby it will be suggested to parents that their child may not be up to it, but that they should let him have a six-week or a two-month period during which the teacher will endeavour to give the child a fair crack of the whip. A subsequent meeting could be held with the parents, when they would be shown examples of their child's work which would show that he was not up to it. In most well-run schools, that would not be a major problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
On the other side of the coin, my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was concerned not just about the grades within the courses but about the range of subjects open to pupils. One of our major concerns is that if the exercise of parental choice were allowed to be carried through in an unbridled form, it could result in certain schools having an even narrower range of courses available. There would then be repercussions for O-grade and higher courses. Parents should be entitled to have a basic range of course options. It may mean that there could be four science subjects or three language subjects. Courses should be available in subjects such as classics and modem languages in the first two years. Those studies may not necessarily be linguistic but may concentrate instead on the life of a particular country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many instances, that may be best suited to mixed ability teaching. We believe that parents should have the right to insist on the availability of that sort of course choice. We recognise that, if a child does not have sufficient ability for a particular course, there is a variety of educational, social and psychological reasons for the school almost to insist that the child is not put on that course. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the Minister's remarks have been primarily about choice within subjects while we are concerned about choice of subjects within schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 68. I do not have to hawk my conscience around the subject of corporal punishment because I was fortunate not to have to use the belt when I was a teacher. That may have been because I was bigger, or 'because I could use non-violent sanctions. I concede that it is difficult to discount psychological sanctions, but if some of the parents whom I met had been given the right to choose whether their children were punished, they would have been happy to have had the stocks, the birch or any number of medieval punishments introduced into the school. In some instances, parents were pleased to abdicate their disciplinary responsibilities to the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I believe that there is a serious point to be made about human rights and parental choice. I would like to see the common law right of teachers to administer moderate corporal punishment withdrawn for ever. We may have the opportunity to debate that issue later. But we believe that parents should be able to say that their children must not be belted and that that should be built into a framework of parental choice. I do not think that the right would 'be exercised by many parents, and that is one argument for allowing the amendment to go forward. But teachers and parents who are opposed to corporal punishment have much to do if they are to convince the rest of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a similarity between corporal punishment and capital punishment in that there is a body of opinion which suggests that we should continue corporal punishment. Many of us reject that argument as well as the sort of populist arguments that favour the retention of capital punishment. Certainly I would be prepared to give a lead to the country from this place on corporal punishment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
Having said that, we want to see the amendment passed and, out of the four, we shall press for a vote on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not requesting that records should be made available to everyone. But parents should be entitled to see them. I remember that 10 or 15 years ago one of the causes celebres of universities was that students should have access to records. In those days I sat in and demonstrated for that right. That argument is now long dead in the universities. Certainly, there is a feeling that there is some kind of professional, almost freemasonic mystique surrounding the records produced by school teachers. The biggest single problem about school teachers' records is that they are virtually illegible, but if they can foe produced in a legible and intelligible form, I see no reason why they should not be made available to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of his regulations, the Minister would have to consider again what the school records should contain. There would have to be a common pro forma, and schools would have to give an undertaking that they were not producing a second set of confidential records, available only to members of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can ask—it is a question we shall consider later, in the context of Warnock—whether the keeping of records is of great importance. But in the well-organised places I have worked in two sets of records have always been available. There is the record of the child's academic achievements and the general assessment of that child, and there is a second set of records about a child's physical defects. Children may have handicaps; they may have hearing difficulties, for instance, or epilepsy. It is very important that teachers should know about such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already, in some schools, books are produced giving a note on every subject and containing a substantial area for comments on the child's ability to integrate with the rest of the class and on his discipline record, and so on. These books are usually distributed to the parents once a term. The parents have to sign and return them, and they come in and speak about them. The books are expanded report cards, and an expanded report card is what in many instances we should be working towards—an expanded report card covering not only academic achievements but also the areas where the youngster can be seen to be in difficulties or to be making achievements, and in which all the teachers who come into contact with the youngster could make comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that on some occasions what the teacher says causes concern to parents. Nothing is more annoying or disconcerting for a parent than to discover that the apple of their eye is in fact—for want of a better expression—a little swine. When one writes on a report card, "Your son is an objectionable little boy", it sometimes takes one some time to explain to a parent in what way the child is offensive. But the exercise is useful both for the teacher and for the parent. If the parent takes offence, the teacher has to make quite clear the nature of the child's objectionable behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see no difficulty here. There ought to be a pro
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
forma, and the parents should have an automatic right of access to the records. We do not say that the records should be trailed through the highways and byways of a school's catchment area. We do not think that such a degree of access would result in the reports becoming anodyne. We do not think it would result in whitewash. It would lead to the development of a far more honest relationship between the parents and the youngsters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will be able to accept amendments Nos. 48, 66 and 70. On many of these matters, there is not much difference between the Government and the Opposition. We recognise that there is some substantial area of difference on amendment No. 68. The Minister will doubtless wish to oppose that amendment, and we will take it to a vote. We are not prepared to accept that in the fullness of time COSLA, in conjunction with the teaching organisations and Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all, will produce an agreement on corporal punishment. It is the responsibility of Parliament to give a lead to the country, not to go at the speed of the slowest. We have been going along that road for far too long. On this issue it is up to us to take the lead, and amendment No. 68 gives hon Members an opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we vote, I should like to speak briefly about my amendment No. 68. The Minister did not seem to be opposed to its principle, but he said that it was premature. I remind him that as long ago as 1968 a joint liaison committee reported on the desirability of controlling and eventually phasing out corporal punishment in Scottish schools. So it appears that the education establishment in Scotland has been dragging its heels in this matter for 13 years. I agree with my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) that it is time that the Committee gave a lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter another discussion on the merits or demerits of corporal punishment. I accept that there is a division of opinion among teachers, among parents, and probably among members of the Committee. But I base my case for the amendment entirely on the projected philosophy of this part of the Bill. The Government say that they want to give parents more freedom, and extend parental rights. The amendment is consistent with that overall projected philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parental involvement in education is very important, particularly in regard to discipline. Parents ought to be encouraged to take more responsibility for their children's behaviour. When children misbehave seriously, surely the parents ought to be informed and consulted about the best method of punishment. If that consultation and agreement does not take place, we are risking the alienation of some parents, and confrontation. I cited some cases last Thursday. We risk confrontation between pupil and teacher, between parent and school, between parent and Government and between the Government and the European Court of Human Rights. If we want parental freedom and parents' involvement in the education of their children, there is a great deal of merit in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the disciplinary procedure within the Committee which will affect the way in which members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
of the Committee vote on the amendment concerning disciplinary procedures in schools. I note that the Government Whip is not here now. I say to Conservative Back Benchers—I speak as an Opposition Whip—that it would be unthinkable for members of the Committee to be whipped to vote for the whipping of children against parents' wishes. I hope that the Government will allow their own Back Benchers a conscience vote on this very important matter, because it is a conscience issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Conservative Back Benchers may be under pressure from their Whip, but this is the time for them to be courageous. They have a chance to go down in the history of Scottish education, because if the amendment is agreed to it will be an important milestone in the progress of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene to ensure that there is no misunderstanding of what the hon Gentleman is offering in the amendment? He is offering parents a right to instruct their children to refuse corporal punishment, so that a child who misbehaves can do what he likes and say what he likes to his teacher, and the teacher will not be able to inflict corporal punishment, if that is the school's normal policy. Furthermore, the amendment makes no suggestion as to steps that a teacher might take to deal with un unruly child in that event. It is an amendment for anarchy in our schools. I am amazed that, as a former school teacher, the hon Gentleman should make such a suggestion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is showing his complete ignorance of Scottish education. He is making the fundamental error of equating all forms of punishment with corporal punishment. There are many other forms of non-violent punishment. Perhaps he would like to refer to my speech of 1976 when I attempted to introduce a Bill into the House. I mentioned cases that have made us a laughing stock in Europe. What were the offences? A wee boy playing tig a few minutes after the bell had gone for the start of lessons. What would I have done in such circumstances, if the boy had missed an important lesson? I would have kept him in afterwards and made sure that he caught up with his work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, a boy climbed over a cemetery wall to take a short cut on his way home from school. Is that an excuse for using a violent form of punishment? Would it not be more appropriate for the boy to be given some useful educational activity rather than the violent, non-constructive form of punishment which the Minister appears to support?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said last week that I eventually abolished corporal punishment completely from my own classroom. I assure the Minister that my classroom was never undisciplined or chaotic. There was no anarchy in my classroom. The Minister is doing a disservice to hundreds of excellent teachers in Scotland who have excellent standards of classroom discipline without having to resort to corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
would be able to keep discipline. I imagine that after a tongue-lashing from him some children might beg for the strap. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I wish that the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) on the Back Bench, who cannot do anything other than talk to a script, would not interrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) accept that there is a difference between a teacher—himself or myself—deciding that we would not use the strap on any pupil in the classroom, and a pupil coming in with a badge round his neck saying "My parents say that whatever I do I must not take the strap"? That would cause severe difficulties at the present stage, which is largely transitional, and when—I accept what the hon Member says—the strap will probably be phased out. I prefer to call it the strap. Playing tig in a corridor can be a dangerous occupation if there are stairs and steps, as the hon Member must know, and it could pose severe difficulties for the teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member has not been as bad as he could have been, but when he resumes his speech will he try to moderate his language, because referring to beatings and violence does nothing for the standing of the teaching profession—a standard which has been dragged down by the obsessive publicists who write letters to the papers on behalf of the organisation called STOPP, which appears to be seeking to damage the integrity of the teaching profession? Will he try to desist from that temptation, and will he also answer the question about the individual child in the classroom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member may not like it, but it is fact that corporal punishment, by its very nature, is a violent thing. I make no apology for using the term "violent". It does not matter whether we use the term "belting" or "strapping" or "physical punishment" or "corporal punishment", or "beating children"—it is an act of violence by an adult against a child. That is the heart of it, and I make,no apology for using such language. I am sorry if the hon Member considers that it exaggerates the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be difficulties for some teachers if the teacher wants to resort to corporal punishment and there is only one pupil whose parents have used the power afforded by my amendment to opt out. But such a difficulty pales into insignificance compared with the difficulties that have arisen in the cases I referred to last week, where there was a massive confrontation between pupil and teacher, with the pupil refusing to take the strap, the parent supporting the child in the refusal, with the result that now cases are pending in the European Court of Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before members of the Committee decide how to vote they should ask themselves whether they really believe in the projected philosophy of the parents' charter, and in an extension of parental freedom of choice. If they do, there is only one way in which they can vote: for amendment No. 68. I appeal to all members of the Committee to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ment. However, I have considered the question of corporal punishment in schools, and it seems that a great deal more is being made out of it than the situation merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the children in schools today are much worse than they were when I was at school—justifying so much discussion on whether corporal punishment should be exercised—and they are getting out of hand, as some hon Members have said. I was fortunate enough in my early days to serve as chairman on an education authority and deal with matters of truancy and behaviour. There were very few occasions on which a question of indiscipline arose. It was more often a question of truancy. I am very concerned that the two organisations responsible for teaching in Scotland seem to have a difference of opinion on whether corporal punishment should be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Minister referred to the "Interim Report on the Responsibilities and Duties of Parents", presented to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities working group on corporal punishment in schools. Even that body cannot arrive at a clear-cut decision on whether there should be some form of corporal punishment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when there was a very difficult pupil the headmaster could effectively deal with him without resorting to the parent. I should not like to think that there would be legislation under which the parent could be prosecuted for the child's actions within the school perimeter. If teachers are as qualified as we are endeavouring to make out—I am not in any way denigrating teachers' abilities, because I have a great respect for them and their qualifications—it should not be difficult for them to discipline children. If there are occasions when a child is beyond discipline, there is the ability to refer him to the reporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that so much is made in the interim report of referral to a social worker. I should have thought that one of the worst things to do with an undisciplined child would be to refer him to the social work department of a local authority. I do not say that with any disrespect to social work departments in local authorities, but a child who is not mature—say up to the age of 18—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is going very wide of the amendment, which contains nothing about social workers. I hope, therefore, that he will curtail his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hunt, for drawing that to my attention. I am merely trying to illustrate the fact that in the report submitted to the Secretary of State concerning the application of corporal punishment in schools, recommendations are made in regard to whom indiscipline should be referred to if corporal punishment is abolished. But if you think that I am wide of the mark, Mr. Hunt, I shall refrain from referring to the subject further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I feel that the question of corporal punishment in schools is a wide factor that we have to consider. If the teachers cannot agree with in their organisations, how are we, who do not deal with them day in and day out, to make any decision in Committee conclusively for or against corporal punishment? We
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
have not received adequate information from either organisation which could show clearly what line we should accept. I have given this matter serious thought, because I object in principle to corporal punishment when it is applied just because a teacher who is not feeling up to the mark may lose his temper with a pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter where conscience applies. I have the greatest respect for the hon Member for West Stirlingshire in his remarks on this matter. Conscience can apply only when each hon Member has made his own decision. If an hon Member cannot make a decision it probably is because of the lack of clarity between the two particular organisations that are in charge of the pupils. Whatever any hon Member decides to do at this stage, he can alter his decision on Report if he has the opportunity of going into the matter further. I certainly hope that the hon Member who suggested that there was any question of Conservative Members being whipped, and not deciding the matter on conscience or otherwise, will take my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are differences of opinion among parents, as there are in the Committee, about corporal punishment. But the parent who takes either view surely has the right to know before he sends his child to a particular school about that school's policy on caning and so on.

I shall quote two attitudes towards corporal punishment—both against it. In the House of Lords on 10 December 1973 Lady Wootton said: "in this country at the present time the only people who can wield a cane with impunity, in the exercise of their professional activities, are teachers and prostitutes."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10 December 1973; vol. 347, 	<i>c.</i> 876.]That is a colourful way of summing up the situation. Here we are making statutory provision for use of inflicting punishment on juniors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Plowden report on primary education said in 1967:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It (corporal punishment) has been almost universally outlawed in other Western countries. It can be associated with psychological perversion affecting both beater and beaten, and it is ineffective in precisely those cases in which its use is most hotly defended. We think the time has come to drop it."</p></blockquote>
That is my view, but some schools and authorities might take an opposite view. The amendment does not refer to the merits of corporal punishment; it simply proposes that parents have a right to know before their child goes to a particular school what that school's policy on corporal punishment is.

I leave that point, because I wish to refer to the question of examinations. I should like the attention of the Minister, who is incapable of rising out of his gutter. On this important matter he was content to make cheap and tawdry party political points. I am capable of making political points when the occasion arises, but this problem is too important to be dragged down to that gutter level. I will leave the Minister in his gutter with it, if that is how he chooses to look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman accused the Opposition of wanting to get rid of examinations and said that we were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
seeking to devalue them. He is right that we want to devalue them and that we want to get rid of formal written examinations. We are not alone in that. Nor is this a new development. For many years there has been criticism of the value of formal, written examinations, and it is increasing at the very time when the Government are seeking to put them on a pedestal which they do not merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote extensively, because it is important to give the views of educationists. The Minister cannot describe himself as an educationist. We must take heed of what is said by those who have taken a lifelong interest in education and who look at these matters as objectively as they can. In an assessment of the situation in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 14 March 1980, Britain is described as an undeveloped country where assessment of school performance is concerned. We seek by the examination system to slot children into categories. The issue of the 11-plus was precisely that the great educational and social argument against it was that children were marked for life as failures or successes, and that there was little opportunity to remedy that situation later. Indeed, some Members of this House make a point of saying "I failed the 11-plus". I do not know whether Winston Churchill failed or passed the 11-plus, but he always made a point of his relative lack of success at school examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too many school examinations are a test of memory rather than intelligence. Many years ago, I used to visit my old grandmother in Durham. She could neither read nor write, but she was one of the most intelligent and shrewd old women I have met. She was far more intelligent than many Members of the House. That is a good illustration of the futility of formal written examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from an article in 	<i>New Society</i> on education and examinations. It is dated 19 June 1980, and headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"How exams cheat our children".</p></blockquote>
It talks about the various presumptions on which we base our examinations. We assume that they are infallible, that children can be put into pigeon holes, often at early and arbitrarily selected ages, and that exams are the best way of measuring intellectual achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have learned from my own experience. My daughter failed the 11-plus. When my wife took her to the exam, she was shivering like a jelly and crying at the prospect of having to take it. She knew that a lot depended on how she performed because her mother and I had told her so. That child was a physical and mental wreck when she went into that examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, we were living in Kent under a Tory-controlled authority. When I visited it, I was told that she would have to go to a school whose pupils did not take O-levels because it was automatically assumed that children who had failed the 11-plus were not fit to take them. I was not having that. I had a row with the Kent education authority and I exercised my right in this House to see the then Minister of Education, Sir Edward Boyle, now Lord Boyle of Handsworth. I told him that I wanted my child to have the right to take O-level examinations because I, too, was a victim of the examination brain-washing exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, she was transferred across the boundary
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
from Kent to a GLC comprehensive school for girls. The two local authorities had to make financial arrangements so that my child could go out of Kent into a more progressive authority. Eventually, she obtained as many O-levels as possible in that school and she is now a fully-qualified nursing sister who, I think, could have become a doctor. That is an example of the slavery to which we subject our children by the examination system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>New Society</i> article is long. I shall quote from it because it puts the arguments pro and con examinations in a concise and persuasive way. It says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"examinations are criticised for the undesirable constraint they place on teaching and learning—a criticism recently rehearsed in HM Inspectors' report on the secondary school curriculum."</p></blockquote>
It continues with the issue that I have just raised, namely the problem of failure. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Public examinations such as GCE O level and CSE are designed to ensure a more or less fixed proportion of the year group pass in a specific number of subjects. GCE O level, for example, was so designed that the top 20 per cent, in the 'ability' range are likely to pass in at least four subjects."</p></blockquote>
That is trying all the time to slot children into categories. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The problem of failure is made worse by the utilitarian, competitive mentality which the existence of examinations precipitates down through the school … Edmond Holmes who, as early as 1911 wrote: A school that is ridden by the examination incubus is charged with deceit … All who become acclimatised to the influence of the system—pupils, teachers, examiners, employers of labour, parents, MPs and the rest—fall victims and are content to cheat themselves with outward and visible signs—class lists, orders of merit—as being of quasi-divine authority'."</p></blockquote>
That is as true today as it was then. It sums up the examination system which tries to categorise each child on the basis of a two- or three-hour written examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He will not get much support from those who are interested in education itself rather than in making party political points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon Gentleman must make his own speech. The author continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this must be the other major criticism of examinations: that they are a cheat; that they do not do what they purport. As early as 1935, Hartog and Rhodes showed major inaccuracies in examining procedures. Study after study since then has emphasised the difficulties of producing tests which are both reliable (in that the same score would be produced by a different marker or on a different occasion, or with a different test) and valid (in that they measure what they purport to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
measure). Add to this the vagaries the candidate himself brings to the testing situation—his motivation, his anxieties, his ability to understand the question … and the point is made."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry to be quoting at such length, but the article sums up the views of those who take a deep interest in these matters. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Examinations are no worse than other forms of assessment in this respect. What is significant is the power illegitimately invested in examinations because they are believed to be in some way 'objective.' "</p></blockquote>
Those arguments must be considered very seriously before we produce league tables for schools, with all the inaccuracies and uncertainties that will flow from that. I would also like to refer to an article in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 28 November 1980, headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Examinations today are performing an outdated function and are obstructing new goals in continuing education".</p></blockquote>
That is not Labour Party propaganda. Those are the words of educationists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article makes the point that in society such as ours, where rapid technological changes take place almost every week and every day, it is extremely important that children at school should be encouraged to understand that their education will not end when they leave school. When the children go out of the school gate, we ought not to go out of our way to dub them—as we still do—failures or successes. Much of the unemployment among our young people today results from the fact that we have categorised them as failures. I know what I am talking about because I have talked to these youngsters at length. They have a grudge against society. They feel that the education system has not given them a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is worse to come. I quote from the 	<i>Glasgow Herald:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Warning for Government on drop in education standards".</p></blockquote>
There will be a massive drop in education standards as a result of the Government's cuts in public expenditure. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Conservative hon Gentlemen should not laugh in that silly, supercilious way. This is a serious matter and should be given serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If education standards fall, and if one then lays even greater emphasis on the categorisation of kids into failures and successes, what will the social consequences be when a child leaves school at 16? He thinks he has never had a chance, and he will take it out on society. "To hell with society!" he says. One of the reasons for the increase in vandalism and violence is Parliament's failure to measure up to the problems that our children in schools, and their parents, are facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to devise a system. I am not clear how it is to be done, but I am certain that we ought not to put children through the mill at impressionable ages. We ought not to lock them up in a room for three hours, put a series of questions in front of them and say at the end that some have succeeded and others have failed; that one must join the dole queue when he is 16, while, because he has passed a memory test—and many of these examinations are no more than memory tests—another stands a slightly better chance of not joining it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must find a way of persuading children—and
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
we should make no distinction between the boys and the girls—that they will have a role to play in society long after they leave school. We are backward in these matters. We have failed abysmally in the provision of informal or formal education and training after the statutory school-leaving age, and we are continuing to fail, and that fact explains much of the failure of our society today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote the end of the article in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effective disqualification of a very large proportion of the adult population from a return to learning in any form is a matter which should be of concern to us all. Economically and socially Britain will stand or fall in the next decades by its ability to help adults adapt to new patterns of living, working and non-working. The willingness of adults to retrain and re-educate themselves is crucial. As long as this willingness is crushed in adolescence by the blunt instrument of public examinations there can be little hope for the future."</p></blockquote>
I think that is an objective assessment of the situation. When one considers that challenge, and thinks of the squalid and superficial remarks of that incompetent Minister, one is frightened for the future not only of the children the Minister is dealing with but of the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>recommend that a pupil be transferred to another educational establishment;</li>
	<li>refer the pupil to the reporter to children's hearings; or</li>

The amendment is self-explanatory. New section 28 H on page 9 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reference to appeal committee, and appeal there from of decision to exclude pupil".</p></blockquote>
As amended, subsection (2) would read as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An appeal committee may, on a reference under this section,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) summon parents to appear before the committee and call for a social work report".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister is much in favour of parental involvement, and the power to summon parents to appear before the committee and the opportunity of studying social work reports on the case is important before a decision is taken by the appeal committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposed new paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) state the options that the appeal committee can take. Paragraph (b) states that the committee can

It will be also be open to the appeal committee under paragraph (c) to
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommend that a pupil be transferred to another educational establishment".</p></blockquote>
It may be advisable in some cases that the pupil be transferred to another school. It would also be able, under paragraph 	<i>(d),</i> to
	<br><blockquote><p>"refer the pupil to the reporter to children's hearings; or"</p></blockquote>
—and we hope that this would be a last resort—
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommend prosecution of the parent."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that in the amendment the hon Gentleman is endeavouring to find another method of imposing discipline upon children—through their parents. It is a perfectly laudable objective, and, as he said, we are anxious to try to involve parents more in all aspects of their children's education. That must include the question of discipline. To that extent we have a common interest with the hon Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon Gentleman will realise that the terms of reference of appeal committees are essentially based on the question of parental choice of school, and the only exception to that is where a child may be excluded from school. An appeal may be made on that ground. In putting the question of discipline before committees, we should be in danger—at least at this stage—of confusing the functions of appeals committees with those of school councils. That is something that we should not do lightly in considering the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly important that COSLA's report on the responsibilities and duties of parents has been presented in Committee this morning. It recommends that questions of this nature should require the appearance of parents before school councils. Consultation on these matters is just beginning and, while I fully appreciate the hon Gentleman's intentions in the amendment, we should allow the consultations to take place on the COSLA document in regard to school councils and see what conclusions are reached. Therefore, I suggest that the amendment is not appropriate at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is as if some of the Minister's speeches were prepared by a word processor. We are always being told that amendments are inappropriate because consultations are still going on. That recurring theme is a source of frustration to us. As I said earlier, we recognise that certain aspects of the Bill are laudable. However, we think that it is a bit of a liberty on the part of the Minister to say that we should meet more frequently, discuss the matter with some speed, but then wait for our reasoned amendments to be given effect until some body elsewhere comes back with a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had that on the questions of corporal punishment and of school prospectuses. The Minister shakes his head. He may choose in advance to ignore what the Scottish Parent Teacher Council's survey will produce, or perhaps he knows better than the pressure groups. It may be a measure of his Department's arrogance that it thinks that it knows better.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
Work has been done on this matter. A report was produced by the Glasgow university education department on the working of school councils, and one cannot imagine that it is that far away from the Conservative Party's thinking, as at least one of its authors is an adviser to the Conservative Party in Scotland on education matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide another responsibility for the school council. We think that the committee's call for a social work report is desirable and would provide a broader base than would simply a child's academic behaviour. There is also the right to confirm or annul the decision of the education authority to exclude the pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those opportunities would serve to improve the credibility and status of school councils, and it would help considerably towards the involvement of parents. If school councils are about anything, it is parental involvement. The rights of the minority of parents have been continually stressed in Committee, but sometimes to the extent of ignoring the rights of other parents who, by and large, are happy for their children to be in the mainstream of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not press the amendment to a vote, but it is a source of regret to us that we are continually confronted with the Minister's response that some body somewhere is considering the matter and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate for him to accept the amendment at this time. It is a matter that we view with growing impatience, but, in spite of that, and in order to speed the Committee's work, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister elaborate on one or two matters contained in clause 2? We realise that the clause is mainly supplementary to clause 1, but we should like his explanation on travel—namely, his opinion on walking distances. Does he consider that there can be problems in urban areas about walking distances? For example, the problem of crossing busy roads is serious and is often taken into account by local authorities when catchment areas are being drawn. In his own constituency at times there has been controversy about the accessibility of particular primary and secondary schools. For instance, I am sure that he knows of Telford road in Edinburgh, which has sometimes been straddled by catchment areas which have later been changed. I would be grateful if the Minister would give us his thoughts on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we should consider walking distances and the problems of safety. Secondly, we should consider the issue of transport and travelling expenses. How much money is the Minister prepared to make available through the rate support grant in respect of expenses such as scholars' passes, as they were once called? What are his views on the funding of parental choice where, for example, the means of travelling to a school may involve public transport, even though the distance is not great? Would he be prepared to finance that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, we are considering urban areas; most of our remarks concerning parental choice have been related to those areas. What problems can he foresee arising from children having to pay bus fares when the request is legitimate? Would the funding come from the rate support grant? The parental right would be empty if parents had to fork out the money, because that would eventually cause other problems. Does not he think that if local authorities have to provide some parental choice, they should also be able to provide financial support, which should come through the rate support grant? Perhaps the Minister would begin by answering those questions, as we should be interested to hear his views before proceeding further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). I understand the Government's dilemma on transport costs. On the one hand, it is valid to say that if parents are to have a choice of schools, they will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
probably think that the payment of transport charges is a small price to pay for the right to enter their child at a school that is more to their liking. My hon Friend the Minister might consider to what extent a local authority could contribute towards a child's transport costs. Could an authority contribute the amount that it would normally pay, with the parent meeting the additional cost? That is a second position on from the first of not paying anything towards the transport costs of a child who chooses to attend another school. Will a local authority be able or be compelled to make a contribution equal to that which it would have made in any case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I foresee a situation in which the reason given for a child attending a school outside his normal catchment zone is that there are other members of the family who attend the same school. For example, when a family moves from one area to another the continuity of the first child's education has to be maintained and at the same time the family feel that it would be desirable for their other children to attend the same school. In that case substantial travelling expenses could be incurred, somewhat in excess of what the hon Member suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable for parents to request that all their children go to the same school so that the continuity of the eldest child's education will be sustained. The eldest child would have, in the short time, the responsibility of taking the other bairns with him, and if they all went together it is not unlikely that substantial financial costs could be incurred. I think that the hon Gentleman's modification in that case would be of little consolation to the family concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon Gentleman's point. It is an additional question in another circumstance. The general question concerns a parent who asks that his child be admitted to a school which would involve extra travelling expenses. The other question is whether an authority would be more willing to help with travelling expenses when the reason given is one of keeping the family together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in these days of public expenditure difficulties it could be construed to be unfair to be spending extra money on children whose parents were exercising their choice. I do not know whether the Opposition think that. Perhaps they are just exploring to see how we can spend more money. It would improve parental choice if, in reasonable circumstances, parents could look to the authorities for help with transport costs, either in part or in total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to assess to what extent a parent can be prevented or put off from making a choice because of transport costs. I understand that it might happen in certain cases where transport costs would be high. That could have an inhibiting effect. It may cut the number of parents who would like to exercise their choice. As I should like to see that choice exercised as widely as possible, even though I accept that my hon Friend may not give me assurances about transport costs that I should like, I wonder whether the matter could be kept under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some effort could be made, once the system starts, to quantify what transport costs might be if a local
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
authority were to undertake them, and if costs were found not to be terrifically high, perhaps the Government, through the rate support grant, and the authority would be prepared to help with travelling costs for children who may have to make longer journeys than they would if they attended their nearest available school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unusually in an education debate, I would like to join the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) as well as my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) in considering the clause. It is not as important as clause 1, but it carries on from that clause. If parents are to be faced with extra costs as a result of making a choice about schools, clause 1 will discriminate against certain sections of the community. I appreciate that that is why the hon Member for Argyll raised the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, parents with children in urban schools will genuinely be able to choose which school their children should attend, but parents in rural areas—particularly the more remote rural areas—will not have the same choice, unless they have a reasonably high income, because they will not be able to pay the transport costs involved. Where I live, in Hamilton, there is no problem, but further south in Lanarkshire—towards Symington and Abington—there is really a choice only between two secondary schools, Biggar and Lanark, and if the parents do not like either of those schools and want to send their children up to Hamilton it will probably cost them a couple of pounds a day—or at least £1 a day—to get the children to school and back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural parents will therefore be particularly hard hit. It is worth remembering that although our discussion has tended to be about secondary schools, primary schools will be involved, too. If a parent decides when his child is 5 years old that he wants to send the child to a primary school other than the one in whose catchment area he lives, the parent himself may have to travel, too, to take the child to school. That is another cost to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as discriminating against the rural child, clause 1 discriminates against poor parents. The hon Member for Argyll said that if transport costs were not very high, parents would still be able to make the choice. But what does one mean by "not very high"? To an unemployed person who has two or three children at school, and who is receiving £40 or £45 a week in unemployment or social security benefit, 25p or 30p a day is a considerable sum. That parent is not in a position to exercise his right to choose under this legislation. We have said all along that unless transport is provided by the local authority for children whose parents make that choice, the choice is limited to those who are relatively well-off. We should consider that problem very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Committee has now agreed to clause 1, but if a local authority has to spend more as a result of this problem and if it is therefore forced, because of the Government's economic policies, to cut other educational services, I would not be prepared to accept that. That would mean that the education service to other children whose parents were not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
exercising their right to choose would be cut to benefit the few whose parents were doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the points made on clause 2 by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in this short clause will play an important part in helping us to achieve the objective of clause 1—to widen parental choice and to encourage parents through the exercise of choice to take a greater interest in their children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 amends the existing statutory provisions regarding reasonable excuse for a child's non-attendance at school and provision of transport and other facilities necessary to facilitate school attendance. The amendments to the statutory provisions are consequential on the provisions contained in new section 28A, which deals with the duty on an education authority to comply with a placing request. The existing provisions are in sections 42, 50 and 51 of the principal Act—the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the clause with regard to section 42, which deals with reasonable excuses for non-attendance at school, is that where a child attends a school other than that proposed by the authority—the authority having proposed for him a school which would not have required him to walk more than the statutory walking distance—he will not have a deemed reasonable excuse for non-attendance merely because arrangements have not been made for him under sections 50 or 51, or because the arrangements made leave him to walk more than walking distance. The Committee will remember that for a child who has not attained the age of 8 years the walking distance is two miles and that for any other child it is three miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the clause with regard to sections 50 and 51 is to ensure that the effective duty of education authorities to provide accommodation, transport or travelling expenses is not extended because of the placement of a child in a school of the parents' choice which the authority had not proposed for him. An authority will have power in such circumstances to pay such additional costs where it considers it to be appropriate, but it will not have a duty to do so. That is the point that was raised by my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend asked whether an education authority could pay the difference between the cost that would have been incurred by the parents if the child had gone to the school suggested by the education authority and the cost involved in sending the child to a school of the parents' choice. There is nothing to stop the authority doing so. Whether it did so or not would be entirely a matter for the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad picture, put at its simplest, is that where a placing request has been met the education authority will be relieved of any duty to provide either transport or travelling expenses to the chosen school, and that, if it decides not to do so, despite the fact that the school is beyond walking distance, the parent will not be able to claim a reasonable excuse for keeping his child from school, as he would have been had his child been placed in the school proposed by the authority. But the authority will have power to make such provision, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
I hope that authorities will exercise that power in appropriate cases. Authorities will be anxious to comply with parents' requests, and will be able to establish the circumstances in which the children are travelling to school or the arrangements that have or have not been made to enable the children to travel to school. I hope that the authorities will consider the cases in which it would be helpful if some provision were made for the expenses incurred by the family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority has a power to do this, but not a duty. If it uses its power, will the Government provide extra money to enable it to carry out that function or will it have to find it from its other education expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that after the Bill is enacted and experience is gained of the amount of use made of the provisions regarding parents' choice, we shall be able to estimate the cost. As the hon Gentleman knows, a number of factors are considered in deciding rate support grant allowances for education, transport and school meals. They are all estimates of one kind or another to try to meet the local authority's considered requirements. It will take experience of the working of the Bill before we can be sure that we have something on which to base these calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But certainly we make the provision which we consider appropriate in all the circumstances. The costs will come from the pool of funds made available to local authorities, and we should be able to assess the extent to which the funds are being affected by the Bill, and, I hope, be able to meet the authorities' requirements to some extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is being a bit less than helpful. The Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum makes the point that the Minister is able to estimate the cost of, for example, the publication of school prospectuses, which lie at one of the corners of the whole concept of parental rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is adequate experience for local authorities, in that there is a body of knowledge about the demand for the exercising of parental choice. In urban areas, which are probably more specifically concerned in the choice of schools, many local authorities are providing subsidised transport for young people. An increase in the demand for such transport would not be difficult to calculate. It should be possible for a Minister to include that in rate support grant calculations after consultation with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parental choice is to be exercised by—I think that we all agree—a minority of parents, the financial consequences of that choice will discriminate against children at present in the system who are being educated to a level satisfactory to their parents' wishes and ambitions. Their educational provision would be undermined to benefit the minority who would have to be taken around our cities by public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is yet another example of the Government's not being prepared to face up to their responsibilities in meeting the provisions of the parents' charter. They are not prepared to fund adequately the parental rights of the minority. Therefore, they will undermine the vast majority of parents whose children's education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
will suffer as a result of the creaming off of money to pay the transport costs of a small group
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel most strongly about this matter. Having laboured long and hard on clause 1, we see, at the turn of the page, that the Minister is not prepared to face up to the responsibilities imposed by clause 1 upon the education service to fund the rights that he seeks to introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rather convoluted argument. I know that the Labour Party has little respect for minorities, but I do not think for a moment that this is a Bill for minorities. It is for the majority of parents who, once they learn of and gain experience of the Bill's provisions, will be only too anxious to exercise choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, in estimating the rate support grant, allowance is made for the number of children within a local authority whose distances from school will exceed the statutory provisions of which I reminded the Committee a few moments ago. It is a matter of swings and roundabouts in regard to the extent to which a local authority has the power and discretion to decide, when a child attends a school other than that selected for him by the local authority, whether to pay travelling expenses. So there will be some gains and some losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was referring to earlier was a method of calculating the allowance, which at the moment is an estimate of the number of children who will require their travelling expenses to be paid by the local authority. The basis of that estimate is bound to be affected by the experience gained from the working of the Bill. We should be able to help those authorities that are using their power under the terms of the Bill. But essentially it is for local authorities to decide the extent to which they wish to encourage parents to take advantage of the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that experience has been gained—which will presumably take a couple of years—will the Government help be retrospective? If a local authority has to spend money under this provision, will the Government ensure that that money is refunded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that the hon Gentleman does not understand what I am trying to say. At present an estimate is made of the number of children in any given authority's area who will receive financial assistance for travel. That rough estimate is made as part of the rate support grant calculation, and it will continue. But the way in which it is calculated will alter as we gain experience of the operation of the provisions. It is not a matter of being retrospective. The experience of matters of this kind changes from year to year. There is no need to be retrospective. If one finds a better and more accurate method of calculation, one uses it. One does not go back 10 years and change the basis of calculation over that period and provide additional sums as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the beginning of what we call the Warnock part of the Bill. In some respects it is probably the least controversial, in that we agree with a fair amount of what the Government are trying to do. The only problem is that we disagree fundamentally with the principle that local authorities should have powers rather than duties. The reason why local authorities are to have powers rather than duties is that the Government are not prepared to provide the means whereby the end can be willed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 is a helpful advance in some respects. The substitution of
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision for special educational needs"</p></blockquote>
for the term "special education" seeks to direct the attention of educationists away from institutions towards individuals. As someone said in regard to unemployment percentages, when a person is unemployed, he is 100 per cent, unemployed. We are not saying that when individuals have special education needs they have 100 per cent, special education needs, but they do provide certain problems for the education system, and it is important that we seek to deal with their difficulties and needs in as humane a way as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am happy that at the outset of the clause, we have the concept of the individual rather than the institution. I may be misreading the Government's intention, but I think that this is what they have in mind and I think that it was one of the underlying themes of Warnock. With the best will in the world, legislation on special educational needs has remained largely unchanged for many years. There have been minor amendments and what might be called tangential legislation in relation to disablement, but there has not been a thorough review of the special educational needs of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope in the course of the next few days to look at some of the areas where we feel that the legislation is deficient. We welcome the addition in the clause of provision for special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have major disagreements over the areas of definition. Subsection (l)(d)(i) provides for a child who has
	<br><blockquote><p>"significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children or, as the case may be, young persons of his age".</p></blockquote>
We agree with that. We consider that the problems of learning and the problems created for the parents and teachers require consideration, assessment and continual monitoring. We welcome these provisions, which in many respects merely firm up the provisions of the 1980 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-paragraph (ii) provides for the child who
	<br><blockquote><p>"suffers from a disability which either prevents or hinders him from making use of educational facilities of a kind generally provided for children or, as the case may be, young persons of his age in schools under the management of the education authority for the area to which he belongs".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
If we had a Government who were prepared to spend money, sub-paragraph (ii) would not have a hollow ring, because we would then be able to ensure that adjustments and alterations were made to school buildings which would bring far more disabled and handicapped children into schools than there are at present. Those who design schools never seem to have to use the buildings which they construct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The design of schools leaves much to be desired, even for those who are not handicapped or disabled. Savings always appear to be made in the corridors of new schools. They are far narrower than they should be. Stairs are invariably steeper than they should be. Children crowd down the stairs on the way to school dinners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great contradiction in schools is that although school children do not like school lunches, and all too few can now afford to take them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. It is ridiculous for the hon Member to suggest that pupils cannot afford to have lunches—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon Gentleman know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because if one goes into any tuck shop at lunch time in any town one will find children spending more money on crisps and fish and chips and pies than they would pay for dinners. I have seen it in my own constituency. Schools that have gone in for snack meals have found that take-up is more satisfactory than that of the meals previously offered. Most of the meals that were being offered were thrown away as pigswill, because the children could not eat them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That interesting intervention is a testimony to that school of sociology known as "bus stop sociology". It adds little to our understanding of the school meals system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is going in for what the Financial Secretary to the Treasury was reported this morning as going in for—namely, what is called "anecdotal evidence." Apparently, that is the latest method by which the Government decide their policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that anecdotal assistance. I do not want to argue about school dinners. I was trying to say that the demand for a commodity is always reflected in its price, regardless of quality, content and popularity. The fall in demand for school dinners clearly reflects the increased prices that the Government have forced local authorities to charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many physical difficulties for the disabled in educational institutions. Those of us who want
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
Warnock to be implemented as quickly as possible are disappointed about the absence of funds. Paragraph (ii) mentions a youngster who
	<br><blockquote><p>"suffers from a disability which either prevents or hinders him from making use of educational facilities of a kind generally provided for children".</p></blockquote>
If more money were available, we should have an opportunity of adapting existing institutions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman say something about what a future Labour Government—if that unlikely event should come about—might do about funds for education? Would they restore the cuts to the 1975 level and would they give extra money towards the implementation of Warnock? Before he replies, he might wish to consult the wife of the right hon Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn), so that he does not get into the same trouble as he did recently at a Labour Party conference on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strangely, I seem to agree more with the wife of my right hon Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) than with her husband. On the occasion to which the hon Gentleman referred there was little disagreement in our remarks; we disagreed more with members of the audience, one of whom is present and may have a chance to speak later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funds and provision for Warnock are not, unfortunately, the responsibility of the Opposition at present. But, if they were, there would be far more money available. It would not be difficult to provide more than the present Government provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One area of concern—we shall return to the matter later—is provision for the under-fives. Those who have special educational needs are probably being treated even less sympathetically than those who can play a full part in nursery school life, and so on. Provision for the under-fives who have special educational needs has been neglected for too long by Governments of both parties. But when there is an overall review of the provision of special educational needs, some extra care should be given to the sick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we shall be able to have some worthwhile discussions on the matter later, so I shall say now only that we are greatly disappointed that the Government have not seen fit to identify this as requiring special care. Indeed, we should have gone further than to specify under the age of 5. We should have said that under the age of 2 is probably a source of even greater concern and anxiety to parents, because it is then that they are confronted with the prospect of a life in which their children's disabilities will place even greater demands on them. We regret the Government's attitude on this matter, because the Minister who will be responsible for the presentation of this part of the Bill is not without compassion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
