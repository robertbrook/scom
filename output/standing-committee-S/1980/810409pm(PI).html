<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to conclude my remarks. Before doing so, may I welcome my hon Friend the Minister with responsibility for health to his Front Bench position. I hope that he will concede some of my amendments this evening.<br><br>
I will round off by saying that in both the school education and further education committee the nomination would be a protection of minorities. Interestingly enough, the minority in one case is the majority in the other. It would be a protection for minorities against either the majority union attempting to vote them off or, in the case of the further education committee, a group of unions getting together to try to vote off another union. I think that the protection of the Secretary of State ought to be afforded to the trade union side and the staff in the negotiations.<br><br>
I hope that my hon Friend will see his way to accepting my amendment. I foresee the possibility of considerable trouble if he does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is in some respects the most contentious in so far as the people affected have been almost universal in their anxiety about this part of the Bill. It is not something that rests on a great cornerstone of education philosophy or something that will engage us in great ideological disputes, which, in education matters, tend to assume an almost theological significance.<br><br>
It is strange that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) expresses anxieties that are much the same as those of the Opposition. It is perhaps one of those rare occasions on which he is in tune with the views of what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 782</span>
I will call the leadership of his trade union. We must be grateful for small mercies in that even the most blind among us can see flashes of light on occasions.<br><br>
I wish to make two points The hon Member for Argyll has an almost touching faith in the role of the Secretary of State but, in my opinion, it is somewhat misplaced. In discussions at lunchtime with a representative of COSLA, it was drawn to our attention that as the Secretary of State will have power to nominate members of the committee both for staff and management, it would not be impossible for him to appoint to the salaries committee representatives of the private sector of education.<br><br>
We know that in many instances, in relation to wages and general conditions, the private sector of education follows the rates that are paid in the local authority sector. But it would not be impossible for the Secretary of State to appoint someone from the private sector to join the management side.<br><br>
It would then be feasible for the management side to get together to vote off these members. That would be done by the management side deciding to include more members, and, when it had exceeded the limit, the Secretary of State would have to accept the removal of some members of the committee. I see that the Minister is taking advice on this point. I am happy for him to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was not taking advice, although he will take plenty during the afternoon. He was saying to the Bill team that surely, whomsoever the Secretary of State chooses, the names will come from official nominating bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the Minister is saying. Our reading of the Bill and of the notes on clauses suggests that it could be open to the Secretary of State to choose, from a variety of bodies, whomsoever he wished to participate in this grouping. The notes say that new section 92 of the 1980 Act empowers the Secretary of State
<br><blockquote><p>" to invite bodies which appear to him to represent teaching staff or education authorities to nominate members ".</p></blockquote>
If the Minister says that the term "education authorities" does not include organisations which represent private sector education, we shall be happy. But certainly we should consider it to be most unfortunate if the Secretary of State were to choose, to participate in a public committee, representatives of private education who, in the main, would not be responsible for the payment of the vast majority of persons who would be affected by these wage deals. I do not wish to labour that point about the private sector. However, if the Minister can define what is meant by education authorities in that context— whether he means local education authorities—I should be grateful. But we await confirmation of that point.<br><br>
There is another side to the issue. If we take together the amendments covering school and tertiary education, there arises straightaway the anomalous position of the Educational Institute of Scotland. That institute is the largest teachers' organisation, claiming about 40,000 members in the school sector as against the 7,000 members of its nearest rival, the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association. A further organisation—which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 783</span>
was known in shorthand as the SSA, but now comes under the National Association of Schoolmasters/ Union of Women Teachers—has a relatively small membership in Scotland, although I am not sure of its size and do not wish to pursue that point. Certainly the NASUWT and the SSTA have had representation on the salaries and conditions of service committees over the years, but, to all intents and purposes, they have been dominated by the EIS.<br><br>
Under these provisions, it would be possible for the Educational Institute of Scotland to increase its membership at the expense of the smaller unions. I missed some of the remarks of the hon Member for Argyll, but I imagine that he was preoccupied with the problem that could arise about the representation of his union on that committee.<br><br>
There is another dimension. Discussions I had today with the EIS suggest that the likelihood of one trade union bouncing another out of membership is remote, if only because all the unions are affiliated to the STUC, which has certain agreements. Certainly the British Trades Union Congress has agreements, many of which were reached at Bridlington and come under the umbrella of the Bridlington agreement.<br><br>
Therefore, we know that within affiliated trade unions the problem outlined by the hon Member for Argyll does not really exist. However, a problem could arise in respect of an organisation which is not affiliated to the TUC or the STUC. There is such an organisation —the Professional Association of Teachers—whose main claim to fame is that it expresses an almost total reluctance to over-use industrial action. It also provides teachers with insurance cover against any mishaps that may occur in the classroom. That benefit has always strongly attracted teachers because, if a child were to blow himself up in a science laboratory, the union would provide legal assistance under its insurance scheme.<br><br>
Nevertheless, while the minority organisations such as the SSTA, the NAS and the UWT would be protected by the undertakings of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, I imagine that the PAT would be inimical to all the organisations that I have mentioned, because most people do not regard it as a bona fide trade union. We are anxious for the Minister to tell us whether that organisation will be invited to participate in the committee at the outset because, if it is, many of my trade union colleagues will be most unhappy. We do not consider it to be representative. Nor will it contribute to the cut and thrust of argument and debate which will lie at the heart of industrial relations and collective bargaining that will be embodied in the Bill if it is enacted unamended.<br><br>
We are also worried about the tertiary sector. In this instance that is strange because, while the EIS is regarded as the big brother of the school sector, it is in an anomalous position in the tertiary sector. It enjoys the support of about 45 per cent, to 48 per cent. of those who would be covered by the other committee, but it would not like to think that an unholy alliance—if that is the correct expression—of other organisations in tertiary education would seek either to remove its representation or to reduce its influence. We want the Minister to tell us how he will avoid that problem, because the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 784</span>
legislation creates the potential anomaly which my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and the hon Member for Argyll have mentioned.<br><br>
It is not for us to offer solutions. The Minister must find solutions to the problems that he is creating. We merely say that it would be preferable—we shall return to the matter on Report if the Minister has second thoughts—for organisations to be represented proportionally so that we may consider the membership from the start. That could be arrived at by some general undertaking and, as membership increased or declined, the necessary adjustments could be made. We want the Minister to assure us that it would be bona fide trade unions which are affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress. We do not have any sectarian desire to squeeze out organisations, but we want to make it clear that the best way of policing a body such as this is to make the organisations involved responsible. We consider that the self-discipline of the membership of the Scottish Trades Union Congress would be the best way of achieving that aim.<br><br>
We are not making a party point. We are simply making sure that these organisations are prepared to abide by the decisions of the Scottish Trades Union Congress. Therefore, we ask the Minister to accept the amendments in the name of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart. If he is not yet prepared to do so, I imagine that my hon Friend would be willing to consider withdrawing them, but that, of course, depends on what the Minister says. However, we have no desire to be obstructive at present.<br><br>
Two different sets of circumstances have to be taken into account. It may be appropriate for the Minister to stand back, re-examine the matter and return to it on Report if he cannot now give us answers that would allay the fears of the bodies that have made representations to us.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Hunt. I also thank the Opposition for their kind welcome on my taking up the unusual position of piloting part of an education Bill through Committee. As the Committee knows, education is not exactly my strong suit. [Hon Members: "What is then?"] As a diversion, health, social work and various other political attributes. However, I do not wish to bore hon Members, who know well of my great attributes. I simply meant to say that I did not consider education my strongest suit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman accept the congratulations of the Opposition on his promotion? It does not surprise us that his hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) has been sacked from the job as a result of the incompetence that he displayed at the end of this morning's sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must point out that my hon Friend has gone to Scotland with the important task of attempting to bring more employment to Scotland. The Opposition should welcome that.<br><br>
Revenons a nos moutons, I say to show that a little education has rubbed off on me somewhere along the line. We have had an interesting debate. I find it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 785</span>
fascinating that the two Opposition hon Members and one Conservative hon Member who have spoken have all been in the education profession during their working' careers. I do not suggest that their present careers are not working careers. I meant to say their previous careers.<br><br>
The amendments are basically in the names of the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). However, as the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) also spoke—not for too long but at some short length— in the debate, I shall mention first some of the points that he made.<br><br>
I was glad to see him agreeing with my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and having some sympathy with the amendments that he has tabled.<br><br>
It is not for me to comment on the dominating position of the EIS in primary and, presumably, secondary education but not in tertiary education. To talk about one trade union bouncing out another may be to stray slightly from the subject. That is a matter for the trade unions. There are cases of that happening, or at least of membership-poaching. However, that is not for me to comment on.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman mentioned the appointment to the management side of representatives of private education. We had not been thinking of the private sector as such. Under the definition in the Bill, the representatives have to be from public authorities. Someone may have another job, but basically we are dealing with public authorities.<br><br>
As regards the teachers' trade unions affiliated to the STUC and the danger of such an association excluding another, we accept that some of the associations have fears. The Professional Association of Teachers does not have a large enough membership, as the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said, to vote other associations off a committee. However, no guarantee can be given at this stage that it would not be invited to be represented. That is a matter for consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us when consultations will be taking place on the membership of that side of the committee? As the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) conceded this morning, those consultations have yet to take place. Does the Minister envisage consultations taking place with the Professional Association of Teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I remember, my hon Friend said that consultation would be taking place with all interested associations and bodies. I believe that he made that clear in a previous speech.<br><br>
The main purpose of the debate is the amendments in the names of my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and the hon Member for Cathcart. I shall deal first— not because he is on this side of the Committee—with amendments Nos. 167, 165, 169 and 166 in the name of my hon Friend. I hope that he will be pleased to know that I listened with great interest to what he, with his great experence of teaching, had to say.<br><br>
In drafting new sections 92 and 95, we had in mind that, after the new negotiating committees are first constituted, the Secretary of State should intervene as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 786</span>
little as possible in matters relating to the membership of the committees. It was for that reason that we proposed the arrangement whereby each side could, in effect, determine its own constitution, subject to the Secretary of State's approval in the case of management.<br><br>
I have carefully considered the argument that it would be possible for an association, or group of associations, having a majority on the teachers' side of a committee, to eliminate the representation of other bodies. It seems to me unlikely that any association or group would behave in that way, but I accept that it is, in theory, possible. In view of the concern that has been expressed, I accept in principle that alterations in the balance of representation on both sides of the committees should be subject to the Secretary of State's approval.<br><br>
I do not know how many times so far the Government have conceded anything—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the first time they have conceded anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but now that my hon Friend the Under-Secretary is speeding on his way to Edinburgh, there is a chance that I may get myself into real trouble. I shall tell him, when he comes back, that I intend to ask him to put down a suitable amendment on Report to meet the points that have been made today.<br><br>
I hope that the hon Member for Cathcart will appreciate that there is no desire on the Government's part to be involved unnecessarily with questions of membership of the committees. It is most desirable that the composition of the management side of each committee, on which the Secretary of State will be represented, should not be changed without such control as can be exercised.<br><br>
In response to the amendments in the name of my hon Friend the Member for Argyll, I have already said that I accept in principle that alterations in the balance of representation on both sides of the committees should be subject to the Secretary of State's approval. In those circumstances, I could not accept the amendments. It is a matter for regret that the two hon Members, who have spent their lives in education, should diametrically disagree on this matter. I should like to think that it was an educational disagreement, but it may be an ideological disagreement.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments in the name of the hon Member for Cathcart. I hope that I shall have a response from my hon Friend the Member for Argyll.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Minister's reply to his hon Friend, I expected the answer that he gave to me, because that was logical. But that is the first concession that the Government have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The second.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there has been another, it was to the Back Benchers as well. It is one of the first concessions that the Minister has made and, of course, it is a concession to his hon Friend, not to the Opposition.<br><br>
The more I look at the clause, the more I feel that the Secretary of State wants the bite of the cherry all the way through. He wants to set up the committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 787</span>
decide when it will meet, decide who will and will not be on it and whether people should or should not come off it. He wants to be a member of it, too, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing the amendment, not clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to my point on the amendment, Mr. Hunt. The Secretary of State wants all those powers. He wants the power to be on the committee, to decide arbitration and to overrule arbitration. The amendment sought to provide one small way of taking away the Secretary of State's power not to decide who should or should not be on the committee, but to veto any nomination which may be proposed.<br><br>
I submit that my amendment makes for good industrial relations. The Secretary of State is not an employer in this situation. He denies on all occasions that he is an employer of a teacher or lecturer in Scotland, even in colleges of education and other institutions over which he has direct financial control. The right hon Gentleman sets up governing boards to the legal employers.<br><br>
Yet, despite the fact that the right hon Gentleman is not an employer, he wishes to have the type of powers in the clause. He concedes that if a trade union has a reduced membership, whereas it had three representatives, that number should be reduced to one representative. That is what ought to take place, but the right hon Gentleman wants to be able to alter the balance in a committee. If the right hon Gentleman takes this new power, he will have the right to forbid such a change.<br><br>
If a change occurs in the balance of employers, which is likely because changes take place in governing bodies of colleges—indeed, I foresee continual changes under the Government's closure plans—the committees should be formed after consultation with all parties. Changes should be left to the parties concerned. The Secretary of State should not have the power to alter or veto those decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us whether the situation which he now envisages as a result of the amendments he intends to bring forward on Report will bring teachers' wage negotiations into line with manual workers, APT and C groups, and other groups which will be serviced by the same secretariat? Will membership of the teachers' committee be the same as in other areas of local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will respond to that question. I do not know whether he will know the answer. I do not know the answer. I was always involved in the teachers' side in these matters. Certainly there were equivalent committees, but they are not the same as they are now.<br><br>
My argument is that, in terms of good industrial relations, the Secretary of State, who is not an employer, should not have these powers. My amendments attempt to deal with this issue by taking away those powers. Good industrial relations involve employers deciding who represents them and trade unions deciding who represents them. That is how the scheme should operate. The Secretary of State wants to have membership of the committees on the management side—and that is right —but he should not have the power to decide how
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 788</span>
others involved choose their membership.<br><br>
In view of the Minister's total lack of response and the fact that we are already beginning to build up rather too much for Report on the clause, I should prefer to have the issue decided at this stage rather than on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon Friend said. It seems somewhat strange that the Government should bring in a Bill which will interfere with the freedom of local authorities, when they are always making promises about increasing the freedom of the individual and of local authorities. Actually, they are doing the exact opposite. For example, they are forcing local authorities to sell off their council housing. In this part of the Bill local authorities are being told that they cannot select their own team, because their team on a negotiating committee will have to be approved in some way by the Secretary of State. To my mind, that is an infringement of the basic freedom of local authorities. Therefore, I support my hon Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke initially, I thought that the problem that I was postulating was theoretical. But after listening to the vehemence of the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in propagating the opposite view, I suspect that it was not theoretical and that there may be more to this danger than I at first thought. I am surprised, however, that the hon Member for Cathcart does not appreciate that even his own union ALCES could be in a similarly difficult position on the FE group, if other unions decided to have an extra representative at the expense of ALCES.<br><br>
I am delighted to hear that my hon Friend is prepared to accept the principle of my amendments. I understand that they do not properly cover the point that I had in mind, but I am happy to withdraw them and to table an adequate amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will be pleased when I say that it is not my intention to reply twice when I consider that I have replied satisfactorily once. But as this is the first occasion, I shall respond, although it is not my intention to continue doing so.<br><br>
I should make one general point to the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). There seems to be an idea that the Secretary of State will appoint everybody and everything. The hon Gentleman knows, from the workings of both parties in Government, that the Secretary of State, be he Labour or Tory, always takes nominations for positions from the bodies concerned. He has not the time to nominate individuals. He is advised by trade unions and professionals. The idea that he operates a dictatorial power is false. In fact, he takes nominations from bodies in education, health and so on. That is how it works for Labour as well as Conservative Governments, so let us put the matter into its proper perspective.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman questioned the control by the Secretary of State over additions to or removals from committees. My right hon Friend did not want this control, but, in view of fears that have been expressed, he saw no alternative. We envisage an entirely reserve power to deal with possible abuses, and consent to reasonable changes will not be withheld.<br><br>

The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) raised a point concerning membership of committees in other areas of local government—for example on the management side. This will be related to the work of the committee itself—not other committees. I hope that this will be my only secondary speech. I am glad that my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr MacKay) has accepted what we are to agree on Report. For these reasons, I ask my hon Friends to reject the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 40, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" (3) The cost of publishing and transmitting copies of settlements in accordance with the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) above shall be borne by the Secretary of State and education authorities in such manner as shall be agreed between them or, failing such agreement, as shall be determined by the Secretary of State ".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 259, in schedule 5, page 57, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>" other than the Secretary of State ".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is self-explanatory. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>" The cost of publishing and transmitting copies of settlements "—</p></blockquote>
the actual documents that outline the settlement of the salary negotiations—
<br><blockquote><p>" shall be borne by the Secretary of State ".</p></blockquote>
As the Bill stands, the cost borne by the committee and thus, in part, by the teaching side of the committee.<br><br>
It is unfair to expect employees to bear part of the cost of publishing what is, in fact, a quasi statutory document applicable to them, and then to supply it free of charge to their employers. My amendment would mean that the cost of producing and distributing the document would be borne by the Secretary of State and the education authorities—the employers. That would be fair and proper. It would be unfair for the employee side to bear some of the cost of publishing and distributing such a document.<br><br>
I hope that my hon Friend will continue in the way that he started and will accept the justice of my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My amendment is similar, but perhaps I could make one point to you, Mr. Hunt. Amendment No. 173, tabled by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) on the part of the Bill to which I am now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 790</span>
going to speak, does not appear to have been selected for debate. I wonder whether there is a special reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman looks at the provisional selection of amendments, he will see that amendment No. 173 appears lower down the list under schedule 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I wish to raise a point of order, Mr. Hunt. May I ask why my amendment No. 259, which makes exactly the same point as amendment No. 173, but in a slightly different manner, has not been linked with amendment No. 173? Perhaps that is pushing too far the fact that you have just come into the Chair and did not make the selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could use that argument. In fact, reasons are never given for selection or non-selection. I must therefore ask the hon Gentleman to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 5, paragraph 6, relating to the recovery of expenditure, states:
<br><blockquote><p>" In so far as such expenditure is not defrayed from income received as aforesaid, it shall be recoverable in such manner and in such proportions as the committee may determine from the bodies, other than the Secretary of State, which nominated the persons who are for the time being the members of the committee ".</p></blockquote>
I have suggested in my amendment that the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>" other than the Secretary of State "</p></blockquote>
should be deleted. The hon Member for Argyll wants to include the Secretary of State. It is the same amendment, even if slightly different.<br><br>
If I press the amendment to a vote, the hon Member for Argyll will be obliged to vote with us, because he believes in it as well. Then, when we come to his amendment, if he is prepared to press it, he can rest assured that he will have my full support if only because this has been one of the extremely rare occasions on which he and I—despite coming from the world of education— have agreed during the Bill's Committee stage. It will give me great pleasure to vote "Aye" at the same time as the hon Gentleman.<br><br>
However, the major point again is that the Secretary of State cannot have it both ways. He cannot say "I shall be a full member of the committee"—although I accept that he will not actually sit on it—"but I shall not take on the financial responsibility of such membership." He is doing that on the subject of the hon Member for Argyll's amendment and on the issue of costs defrayed by the committee.<br><br>
Considerable costs are involved. There will be a secretariat, possibly a large office, two large committees, and travelling expenses. The people who will be elected will not be full-time officials who work in Edinburgh. They will come from all over Scotland. It is unjustifiable for the Secretary of State to say "I shall not bear any of the burden", particularly as at present he bears the full burden of expense for three of the five committees that will be abolished—namely, the college of education conditions of service committee, the college of education salaries committee and the central institutions salaries committee. It seems to be a shoddy piece of expenditure cutting.<br><br>
The hon Member for Argyll may not have used the same words as I have, but what he said was essentially the same. It is most unfair and unjust to place on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0447">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 791</span>
employees and trade unions the burden of expense, especially as under this Government they are likely to negotiate very low wage increases in the negotiating committees. I shall certainly support the hon Member for Argyll's amendment, because he is right in this respect. I hope that he will support my amendment, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure of the Government's intentions in respect of schedule 5 and proposed new section 93. My understanding of the matter is that the secretariat—like Topsy—has growed over the years. At one time there was an unwritten convention that certain local government wage negotiating bodies would be serviced by different local authorities. In the main, the old Edinburgh corporation had responsibility for servicing the wage negotiations.<br><br>
With the reform of local government and the streamlining of many negotiating bodies, the national joint council was set up, and that has mainly been responsible for servicing the major committees. I know that minor committees dealing with central institutions and colleges of education, and so on, are serviced almost exclusively by the Education Department.<br><br>
I feel that there should be some sort of consistency in and justification for the Government's approach. I appreciate that they have been consistent in deciding that the money must be found both from the staff and management sides. But I can think of few other areas of wage negotiation and collective bargaining where it is incumbent on both sides to fund the costs. Certainly, in the private sector it would be inconceivable for trade unions to have to help to pay for wage negotiations. So far as I know, the proposal is not being extended to other areas of wage negotiation.<br><br>
Earlier, I asked the Minister a question which, by accident or design, he was unable to answer, about the conditions being imposed on the two new committees and whether they are consistent with what is happening elsewhere in local government in Scotland. I would like the Minister to tell us whether the servicing of secretariats concerned with negotiations for wages and conditions of service relating to other groups of local government workers is to be undertaken by the union and management sides—or perhaps that funding will come from the sale of the memoranda which will be published as a result of the deliberations of the committees. It is important for us to know the arrangements for determining wages and conditions.<br><br>
We want to know whether the education sector is being treated as a special case. If so, we wonder why. Is it because the SED has been able to bend the ear of the Secretary of State? Is it because the Minister has not appreciated it? We think that that is a dangerous precedent. We are confident that in no other area will the unions and management together be expected to fund the cost of the negotiations of local government salaries and conditions.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
A levy of £2 per head is imposed on those who are registered with the General Teaching Council to meet the cost of any expenditure. We already know that grants are also made available by the Secretary of State. We would like to know why what is good for the GTC is not good for the new bodies negotiating salaries and conditions. That is a technical point. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 792</span>
our estimation, it is mean and petty of the Government to seek to slip through expenditure cuts in that way. They are creating problems which will move the frontiers of public expenditure much further back.<br><br>
Instead of the Minister having to find the money through subventions from the Treasury it will have to come from local government, which will put in an appeal for more money under the rate support grant. At the same time, in response to union requests for higher union dues, the workers will request that some additional allowance be sought, in their wage negotiations to take account of that burden.<br><br>
I do not want to make heavy weather of what is a fairly small point, but that is indicative of the pettiness of the Minister's approach. I appreciate that the Minister does not have responsibility for education in the normal course of events. Therefore, I ask him to reconsider the position and to advise us later about it. The local authorities do not want it, the secretariat is embarrassed by it and the trade unions are bemused by it because they do not know where they are to find the money to meet that expenditure. I ask the Minister to reconsider and to take on board the amendments tabled by my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) attempts to move some distance from the intentions of the clause under which the Secretary of State will cease to pay for the publication of settlements of negotiations between the teachers' unions and their employers. That is to be welcomed. I am certain that my hon Friends will give it their support. The EIS, the SSTA, the NASUWT will be relieved of having to pay for that publication, which is something we certainly support and welcome.<br><br>
However, under the hon Gentleman's amendment the education authorities will remain responsible for making a contribution towards the cost of publication. That is not good enough because, no matter how small the amount they may be asked to contribute towards the cost of publication, that money should be spent on education and not used for helping the Secretary of State out of his difficulties. Clearly, the education authority could use that money for educational provision. Surely, if the hon Member was serious, he would have included the education authority.<br><br>
I foresee a time when education authorities and teachers' unions may fail to agree on a wage settlement. The teachers' unions may take action to encourage the authorities to see their side of the argument more clearly. In the end the authorities may consider that they were having an agreement forced upon them and, although they may have to contribute towards the cost of publishing the discussion and the settlement, they would not be very helpful. I can see one or two problems there.<br><br>
The amendment says that if the Secretary of State and the education authorities fail to agree on the cost of publication, the decision passes back to the Secretary of State who may decide to impose the original cond-tions—namely, to pass the responsibility for the cost to the education authorities and the teaching unions. The Secretary of State could then decide that the cost should be borne equally by the education authority and the teaching unions. In other words, the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 793</span>
State could use the hon Member for Argyll's amendment to implement the original intentions of the clause. I am sure that the hon Member for Argyll did not propose the amendment for that purpose, but it could be used in such a way.<br><br>
I accept that the hon Member for Argyll is seeking to help the teaching unions but, because of the woolliness of the last part of the amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>" failing such agreement, as shall be determined by the Secretary of State "—</p></blockquote>
it could be abused by the Secretary of State. In effect the hon Member may simply be handing over powers to the Secretary of State to reach a decision which the teaching unions would oppose. For example, they might have to make a contribution towards publication of the settlement and the cost of transmitting that settlement to the bodies concerned.<br><br>
I hope that the hon Member for Argyll will tell the Committee why he has omitted the education authorities from the amendment. I should be very interested to hear his reason. Why does he feel that they should make a contribution? Does he not accept that the Secretary of State should be wholly responsible? Would it not be better to include the education authorities and return to the status quo—that the Secretary of State is responsible for publishing and transmitting the settlements resulting from negotiations?<br><br>
As I said earlier, Opposition Members will support the amendment. It is woolly and needs to be cleaned up, but it is an improvement on the Bill as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add to the remarks of my hon Friend the Member for Dundee-West (Mr. Ross).<br><br>
It has been said by hon Members that the amendment is a technicality. I should not imagine that the Minister thought that those changes would save costs. The costs must be minimal. Surely the Government are not so desperate that they would be prepared to endanger good industrial relations? The amendment may be technical but, as a life-long trade unionist and trade union representative, I would take it very badly if any trade union had to bear such costs.—Such a provision would mean that even the initial negotiations would be bogged down by trying to recover that cost. Therefore, rather than helping industrial relations, it could create severe difficulty in achieving an agreement. If, in the initial stages of any discussions we are to fight about who is to pay, clearly, in the end it will cost both sides more money.<br><br>
As I said, I am interested in what the Minister has to say about why this change was thought necessary. I should also like to ask the hon Member for Argyll why he chose to do it in this fashion. I suggest that the hon Gentleman did not think the matter through far enough in respect of where the finance should be borne. Since, in a practical sense, he is correct in supporting the trade unions on this occasion, he should go the whole hog and revert back to the position that the Secretary of State should pay for it. Throughout the Bill, the Secretary of State is being given powers that he did not have prior to the Bill, and he ought to pay. After all, he will call the tune on many occasions, and he who calls the tune ought to pay the piper. On
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 794</span>
this occasion, the right hon Gentleman should carry the full cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again we are indebted to my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) for putting down amendments that have initiated discussion among all Committee members. 1 shall not say that they are exactly becoming heavenly twins. I had better not use the emotive description of twinning, or the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) might see it as a rather different type of twinning, of of what we have between my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill).<br><br>
Before I return to the question raised by my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and the hon Member for Cathcart, I tell the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire that I intend to answer two of the comments he made. I hope that I do not get into his bad books when 1 say that 1 cannot guarantee always to respond to everything he asks, because in a narrow debate like this, in my opinion—and this is a subjective judgment—he is inclined to try to widen the issue into matters not specifically related to the details of the amendments. At this stage in our proceedings I do not intend always to follow up every allied subject brought up by the hon Gentleman.<br><br>
However, the hon Gentleman made two specific points. The first was the matter of specific arrangements for new bodies. What we proposed in this respect largely repeats the arrangements which already apply for teachers' pay negotiations. In respect of whether the unions should not contribute, the bodies who nominate teachers' representatives, the Scottish Teachers' Salaries Committee, now bear half the expense of the committee, which is in the standing orders of the STSC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's partial answer to my question. I do not want to press him on the matter, but 1 think that I must. I am not trying to extend the generality of the question, but, as we are talking about local authority wages, I should like to know whether the other branches of local authority employment, the other sectors—1 mentioned manual workers, the APT & C groups and others—have to operate under the same set-up in terms of the membership. I realise that that issue has now been dealt with, but, 1 should like to know, in terms of financing, whether they will operate under the same conditions as teachers will have to operate, or as teachers' employers. That is what I want to know, and I do not know why the Minister is so coy about answering the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He does not know the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman does not know the answer, one would imagine that there are others in the Committee Room who could furnish it. If the Minister does not give us the answer, we shall have to return to the matter on schedule 5. He will not get away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not expect to get away from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 795</span>
question, but I can certainly not give the answer off the top of my head. I will give the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire the answer either before I finish my remarks or, if not, I shall certainly give it to him during the course of the afternoon or tell him why I am not giving him an answer. He will be given one of those three things. I hope that that satisfies the hon Member.<br><br>
We also heard two interesting speeches from the hon Members for Dundee, West (Mr. Wilson) and Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), which did not bring up any new points that require answering. I shall therefore turn to the main speeches in the debate.<br><br>
I refer first to my hon Friend the Member for Argyll. A friendship that blossomed a few moments ago might well be on its way out because, in my hon Friend's absence from the Committee, I cannot guarantee that I shall land him with every amendment or that it will be accepted by my weak and kindly nature in his strong and virile absence. On this occasion I feel unable to accept his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is strong and virile?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Paragraph 7 of schedule 5 makes provision for the residual expenditure of the negotiating committees to be recoverable from the bodies, other than the Secretary of State, that are represented on the committees. This is normal for negotiating bodies. Therefore, it is in part unnecessary duplication, and in part at variance with schedule 5, to provide a new section 93 for the costs of publishing and circulating settlements.<br><br>
I realise that the main point of the amendment is to propose that the Secretary of State should contribute to the costs. But, although he will be represented on the committee, he is not an employer and I do not consider that his representation, which is related to his overall public expenditure responsibilities, makes it appropriate for him to contribute towards the costs involved in pay negotiations.<br><br>
The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart made two specific points. He stated that the Secretary of State cannot be a full member of the committee and contribute nothing. He also spoke of the costs involved. As regards his first point, I can only repeat what I said to my hon Friend the Member for Argyll—the Secretary of State is not an employer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is a member of the committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is not an employer.<br><br>
The costs that the hon Member identified are already being incurred. They are not new. Normal expenditures are borne by the bodies that are represented, and to the extent that the Secretary of State bears part of the cost indirectly for areas of education or controlled institutions, he will largely continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is, I hope, not confused. However, I should like to make the point that in the present situation, whatever the STSC is doing on the present negotiating committee for salaries and condi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 796</span>
tions of service in colleges of education and salaries in central institutions, the Secretary of State, unless things have changed in the past two years, bears the full cost. He bears the cost of travel and meal expenses, subsistence and so on. I accept that it is done through specific colleges, but those colleges receive a special grant from the Department if they have lecturers or members of the governing board on the committees. The costs do not come out of the colleges' normal allocation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only say to the hon Member that in this specific instance the answer that I gave to my hon Friend makes the matter perfectly clear. It hinges on the point that the Secretary of State is not an employer.<br><br>
Turning to the amendment tabled by the hon Member for Cathcart, I realise that he does not expect me to swither as I did with my hon Friend the Member for Argyll. As my hon Friend said when we debated amendment No. 173, although the Secretary of State will be represented on the management side of the new negotiating committee, he is not an employer and we do not consider it necessary or appropriate that he should pay a share of the expenditure. The provision for recovery of expenses in schedule 5, which the hon Member referred to and which he may well return to on schedule 5, as he promised, reflects normal practice in negotiating bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend saying that in other negotiating bodies in other areas of local government the situation in the Bill applies and that the employers' side and the employees' side bear the cost? I should be grateful if he would clarify that and confirm that teachers are rather a special case, as their present position differs from that of other bodies of employees subject to other local government negotiating procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as we know at present the answer to my hon Friend's question is "Yes", but I shall check and wrote to him if that is not absolutely correct.<br><br>
The provision in schedule 5 for recovering expenses reflects normal practice in negotiating bodies. In those circumstances, and in view of what I have said, I must ask both sides of the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a remarkable reply. I have to accept the Minister's statement that the Secretary of State is not an employer. I made that point myself. I remember once spending six months poring over industrial legislation and consulting lawyers in a desperate attempt to get the Secretary of State— the previous incumbent, not the present Secretary of State—declared an employer. The position is anomalous. There is double dealing, though not by the Minister, whose advice on the matter is perfectly correct. The Secretary of State can claim "I am not the employer. I will not bear the burden of the cost, but I will sit on the committee and dictate the level of wage increases"<br><br>
The Secretary of State controls the purse strings, especially in the colleges of education and central
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0450">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 797</span>
institutions, which have no extra income. Apart from a small sum from fees, the only income of colleges of education comes from the Secretary of State for Scotland. Unlike local authorities' money, their income does not come from rates and other sources; it comes solely from the Secretary of State. The idea that merely shoving a governing board between himself and the lecturers and the college relieves him of an employer's responsibility is outrageous.<br><br>
The Secretary of State should make a choice. Either he is a member of the committee and pays his share of the costs or, if he is not prepared to do that, he should get off the Committee and allow negotiations to take place freely between the local authorities and the trade unions, let them get on with it, then pay the local authorities the money. He cannot enjoy the double standard of insisting on being a member of the committee yet refusing to dirty his hands by passing over any money because legally he is not an employer.<br><br>
It is arguable that if I dug deeply enough I might be able to prove that the Secretary of State really is an employer. Educational instructors in borstals and similar institutions that come under the Secretary of State are paid on teachers' salary scales. I may be wrong; none the less perhaps that should be investigated. The Secretary of State's direct control of those institutions may make him a direct employer. That is an interesting suggestion for the advisers to go away and think about.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) will rise when I sit down, even though he now appears to be assiduously going through his mail. I hope that when he does so he will not accept his hon Friend's answer, and will press the amendment to a vote. That would give me great pleasure. I am not entirely sure of the procedure, Mr. Hunt, but if the hon Member for Argyll seeks to withdraw his amendment 1 should wish at the appropriate time to move formally my amendment in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have been here before. I do not have much sympathy with the substantive argument of the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), which is that the Secretary of State must be involved. I am still not totally happy with the new situation, either. However, if, as my hon Friend says, the teachers are in an almost unique position compared with other negotiating bodies, I see the logic of changing that and putting the teachers' negotiating body on the same basis as the others. 1 noted that the Minister said that he would confirm the details of the situation, and I look forward to that confirmation. I would seek leave to withdraw my amendment, but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should get off his knees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However, I say to my hon Friend that if when he comes to confirm the situation he finds that things are not as he has said, 1 shall consider returning to the matter on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we vote on these important amendments, I must protest about the crawling attitude of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). He tabled the amendments probably on the advice of Mr. James
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 798</span>
Docherty of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, which he supposedly represents in the House. Now he is taking the cowardly way out and kowtowing to the Minister.<br><br>
When I saw that the other Minister was absent tonight, I was at first relieved, because I thought that we might at least have some decent replies from his substitute, but the substitute on the Front Bench is even worse than the Minister who was on the Front Bench this morning.<br><br>
Before we vote, the Minister ought to tell us—he is a great guy for going on and on about taxpayers' money— what the cost would be of amendment No. 168 and of amendment No. 259.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Are we not entitled to answers to these questions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order. It is entirely in the Minister's discretion whether he replies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then I shall continue my speech, as the Minister refuses to answer. It is a disgrace that we have such a clown of a Minister, sitting here and refusing to give information to the Committee. The Committee is supposed to be passing legislation, but the Minister is so incompetent that he refuses to tell us the costings of the amendments. That work should have been done by the civil servants all sitting here. If they have not got the information, the Committee ought to be suspended until we have it, before we vote on the amendments. It is a disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is discourteously refusing to give an answer—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This particular Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes I have to confess that this Minister's answers are no better than the other Minister's answers, but at least they are delivered in a slightly more polite manner than the other Minister's answers.<br><br>
If the Minister is not prepared to give the answer, I shall give an answer. I cannot give my hon Friend the figures, but this is my view. Given that three out of the five committees—I accept that they are the three minor ones compared with the two larger committees— are already at present entirely paid for by the Secretary of State, then, arguably, even if the Secretary of State accepts both amendments, he would still save money in comparison with the present situation. It would still represent a cut in public expenditure.<br><br>
I may be wrong about that, but that is my view. Even if the amendments were accepted, the Secretary of State would still save money, because he would not be meeting the cost of the three committees that now exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem now to be in the same situation as we are in with the Government's disastrous proposals to close down colleges of education, telling us that that will save public money: they cannot quantify the amount of public money that is involved. They cannot quantify the amount of money involved

in these amendments—indeed, they cannot say whether any public money is involved.<br><br>
I appeal to you, Mr. Hunt, as Chairman of this Committee, that we are surely entitled to extract information from this Minister.<br><br>
He clearly has not done his homework and is just reading out a brief which has been prepared by the civil servants and passed to him from the other Minister, who is not with us this evening. But the Minister might at least make an effort and have the courtesy to say that, if he has not the information here at this moment, he will supply it to us later so that we may come to a reasoned decision on the matter on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In spite of the belligerence of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), I shall have the courtesy to make one remark on his fairly odd question. It is not a question of how much. It would only be transferring the payment from one pocket to another. It is totally irrelevant to the arguments that I gave for not accepting the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the Ministers are treating the Committee reminds me, not surprisingly, how the Canadian Federal Government are treating the Indians and the Eskimos— they refuse to give them any information. But, seriously, in my short time on this Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—I have noticed a substantial difference between it and others on which I have served, particularly Committees on United Kingdom matters, where Ministers of exactly the same Government, I confess, have gone out of their way not just to read out briefs which repeat what has already been told to the Committee and explain the clauses but actually to help the Committee by giving reasons. Reasons are very different from explanations. On the few occasions that I have been able to be present here, I have heard no reasons from the Minister. Also, Ministers have often been asked for information and have been unable to provide it.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
It is a serious point. Are Committees being treated improperly, in a shabby manner? Is it a breach of privilege, or discourtesy to Committees, when material information is not supplied? I wish that you, Mr. Hunt, or someone had the power to say to the Government that, for proper consideration to be given to legislation, Ministers should be directed to provide some of the information that we request. Again and again we have asked for information and explanations. We have asked for reasons, but none have been given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that the way in which these Scottish Committees proceed is the perfect case for devolution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend will not be surprised to know that I agree with him 100 per cent.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 800</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is very wide indeed. I hope that the hon Gentleman will confine his criticisms to the amendment. He is tending to go extremely wide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cost of publishing and transmitting copies of settlement ought to be easily obtainable. The cost of printing, postage and all the arrangements is not substantial. Indeed, it would not cost much to find out. There are at least seven civil servants sitting alongside you, Mr. Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it right for an hon Member to refer to people who are not members of the Committee? If any members of the public or of the Civil Service are present, are they entitled to be referred to by a member of the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that a passing reference is perfectly in order, but I hope that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will not pursue that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is in order, Mr. Hunt. I get frustrated and annoyed at the so-called protocol and precedents of the House, which pretend that no one else exists when we know that they do. When information is material to the matter under consideration, elected Members are entitled to have that information. I was merely trying to point out that the Minister has people to advise him, so we ought to be able to get the information that we need. There are other clauses still to be considered and, if we continue to be treated in the same scurvy way by the Government, we cannot give proper consideration to the matters before us. For instance, we shall shortly reach—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is again going wide of the amendment. He can refer to these matters on clause stand part, but at present he must keep to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to point out that this information can be easily Obtained, Mr. Hunt. I shall be asking for a lot of information when we come to other clauses and, if I do not get it, there will be a hell of a row.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I might briefly respond to the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who I appreciate has been on another Committee and who has therefore missed some of the previous debate. But I hope that before he left, he checked that his remarks about Eskimos were agreeable to that very fine race. The suggestion that I was treating Labour Members like Eskimos did not seem to me to be very complimentary to Eskimos. Perhaps when he goes back to the other Committee the hon Gentleman will check up on that.<br><br>
May I also say to him that he will get a perfect chance to check <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow with regard to the answers to the questions that came up during the debate which he did not hear. Doubtless he will check that very carefully.<br><br>
With those few remarks, I still ask my hon Friends

to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From what the Minister said earlier, it seemed that he was arguing that it would make no difference to the public purse whether the Committee voted for the Bill as it stands, for the amendment tabled by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) or for that tabled by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and my other hon Friends. If that is true, my natural instinct is to side with my hon Friends, so I shall certainly support them.<br><br>
I appeal to the hon Member for Argyll. There comes a time when one must vote where one's mouth is. It is useless to put down amendments and then to ask to withdraw them or to vote against them. Although the hon Gentleman is not a Socialist comrade—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dennis, Dennis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is a fellow former teacher, a fellow mathematician, and I am sure that he is reasonable underneath that hard exterior—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman must not say "Dennis, Dennis" to persuade his hon Friend to give way. He must use the traditional method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite normal for us to recognise that we know each other, Mr. Hunt. My hon Friend had his back to me, and I did not want to shout "Hey you" which would have been even worse.<br><br>
While my hon Friend is speaking about the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), perhaps he will remind the hon Member that there is also the question of sponsorship. If the hon Member continues to duck the issue by failing to press these amendments to a vote—clearly they have been given to him by his sponsoring organisation—he will find it difficult to convince the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association that it should continue to sponsor him. We do not want him to lose that sponsorship, because he makes a valuable contribution to that organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that relevant remark. The hon Gentleman is sponsored by the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association. He may not be financially sponsored by it, but he is an adviser, or unpaid hack as my hon Friend said—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be galling for Labour Members to find out that any of us have ever belonged to any trade union of any sort. It must destroy their general nice class thesis about society. I am aware that Labour Members are truly sponsored by trade unions, which means that they represent the unions rather than the Labour Party. But I am not sponsored by the SSTA in any way. I act merely as its unpaid, parliamentary adviser because I was once a member of that union, and I retain an interest in its affairs: Labour hon Members will understand that, but, unlike them, I am per
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 802</span>
fectly free to think for myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Their aristocratic pugilist Whip tells Conservative hon Members how to vote, unlike the Opposition side of the Committee, where I am the Whip and give all my hon Friends a free vote. There is no such thing as a free vote on the Conservative Benches. I appeal to the hon Member for Argyll this time to use his freedom and to say to himself "Maybe my loyalty to my old profession—our old profession —"ought to be better than the loyalty to this old Etonian who knows nothing about Scottish education, and who will crack his whip in a couple of minutes and try to get us to vote against the interests of the teaching profession". It is time the Government were defeated in this Committee, even on something which may not be of earth-shattering importance but which is, nevertheless, an important matter of principle.<br><br>
I sympathise with the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East when people mix up his constituency with another. People used to get my constituency mixed up with another when I first came to this House. An SNP person was representing Stirlingshire, East then, and I resented being called the MP for that constituency. In fact, Stirlingshire, West is a beautiful part of the country.<br><br>
I appeal to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East, who is a well-known petrol rebel. However, there are more important matters in education. We know that petrol prices are very important to his constituents, but so is the whole structure of the salaries and negotiating procedure for teachers in Aberdeenshire, East. Possibly the hon Member could build up his majority, which is slender at present, if he got more teachers to vote for him and, similarly, for other hon Members.<br><br>
The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) succeeded a teacher representative in this House. I know that Mr. Andrew Welsh is still scurrying around up there trying to dig up teachers' votes, but the hon Member for South Angus, who, unlike the Whip, went to a Scottish private school—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These reminiscences are out of order. I suggest we return to the amendment, and I hope that we can move to a vote very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just moving into my final crescendo, Mr. Hunt. If we listen to the reasoned case of the hon Member for Argyll and my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart, there is only one way to vote on the issue—to vote for one or other of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman wish to withdraw his amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 41, line 2, leave out "further education" and insert: <br><blockquote><p>"non-university post-school education".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 243, in page 41, line 19, leave out "further education" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"non-university post-school education".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 248, in page 45, line 2, leave out "further education" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"non-university post-school education".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At long last we have reached an amendment that the Minister can concede without any bother. There is no party political point, or even a trade union one. The proposal will cost no public money—except perhaps in the fact that five words will be used instead of two, which I suppose will lead to an infinitesimal increase in printing costs.<br><br>
At present the title on page 41 is misleading. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pay and conditions of teaching staff employed in providing further education".</p></blockquote>
It is misleading, in view of the historical and general use of the phrase "further education". To the minds of people in Scotland that has a certain connotation —namely, the provision of further education in colleges which are under the control of local authorities. But the committee that is being established does not include in its consideration the pay and conditions of lecturers in FE colleges as such, but merely of those from what are called the central institutions and the colleges of education, both of which, rightly or wrongly, consider themselves in a different category from those in the further education sector.<br><br>
My amendment is more specific and exact. It gives a terminology—"common parlance" is the wrong phrase; no one would use such phraseology—that has been accepted and is used in Scottish circles in Scotland. The so-called Ferguson committee is in fact the committee for the grading of courses in non-university post-school education in Scotland, which is a long and unwieldy title.<br><br>
I served on that committee from its inception. We examined a variety of different titles and snappy initials that would give us a word to play around
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 804</span>
with which would sound right. Finally we decided that we should have to use the phrase "non-university post-school education" because it describes exactly what is involved—namely, education that is past that of school age but not part of the university. I accept in advance all that the Minister may say about unwieldiness, but the proposal gives a definition that is exact, which, in common parlance, "further education" does not. The opportunity has finally come for the Government to be generous to the Opposition and to concede a minor point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the other side of Socialism —that is, the quiet, pleasant, cooing side. It is not the Tribunite side or the Social Democratic side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it in order for the Minister to insult me in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should need a definition of "insult" but I think that we should let the matter go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon Gentleman that in no way did I mean to insult him. I was referring to the gentle and pleasant manner in which he put across his argument, unlike the blunderbuss from West Stirlingshire, who tries to thump his point home.<br><br>
In this instance the argument was cooed. It was suggested that the proposal was not political and would not cost anything, because it was just a very small matter. In this case it was cooed that it was not political and would not cost anything because it was just a very small thing. However, I regret to say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the ugly face of capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will explain quite clearly why we cannot accept the amendment. The reason is quite simple. The term "further education" is already defined in the 1980 Act as including voluntary part-time and full-time courses of instruction for persons over school age. Section 135 of that Act makes clear that further education within the meaning of the Act is provided not only in colleges of further education but in colleges of education and central institutions. I am, of course, aware of the increasing use of the term "non-university post-school education" but it has no place in the Education (Scotland) Acts. Therefore, with that simple explanation, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This gets more ludicrous as the days pass. I am looking at section 153 to try to find—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 135.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a definition of further education in section 153 of the Act. It is very interesting —it actually includes the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, but that is another matter to which we will come later. I believe that it is the major Act, and if I read the definition of "further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 805</span>
education" correctly—it may be that the Minister will have to examine this a little more carefully—I would argue that it includes the universities. If that is the case, he had better have a word with the universities and the AUT in Scotland about whether he will bring them into the Act under this definition. The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is very good at shaking his head in the Committee, but the fact is that there is a clear understanding of what "further education" means. It may be defined in different ways in different Acts.<br><br>
The expression "non-university post-school education" has been used. It has been used to describe the only organisation in Scotland at present which covers the three sectors which are now being brought into this Committee, and that is the so-called Ferguson committee, which gardes all the courses and says what the pay shall be for the lecturers who teach specific courses right through. That is the only organisation in Scotland at present which represents the employers and trade unions in the three sectors which we are now bringing together. The Secretary of State's advisers are on that committee, and, when we considered its name, the title we came up with was what I have put down in the amendment.<br><br>
I had thought that for once the Minister would have conceded the amendment because it is so irrelevant. The Minister could have said "We have been rotten and nasty to the Opposition throughout the Bill. We are approaching its end and at long last we can concede something." But does he? No. Even though he has the same Social Democratic politeness and blandness that I have, at heart he is as ruthless and nasty as his colleagues. The hon Gentleman puts the boot in perhaps more politely. He may have a silk sock over the end of his boot instead of a steel tip, but the boot still goes in. This is something which he could have conceded. I shall not waste the Committee's time by calling for a vote but I wish he had given way on the amendment.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 44, line 28, leave out "retrospective".<br><br>
This is a probing amendment, because the clause states that nothing in the procedure in respect of the negotiating machinery
<br><blockquote><p>"shall authorise the retrospective—
<ol>
<li>reduction of the remuneration of a member of teaching staff; or</li>
<li>alteration of the terms and conditions of employment of such a member if that alteration would be to his detriment."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I seek to take the word "retrospective" out of that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 806</span>
provision, but I should like to know what is in the Minister's mind. The word "retrospective" means putting back to a previous date, as I understand it. So what the salaries committee cannot do is to come along and decide that all lecturers in colleges of further education in Scotland, for example, shall have their salary reduced by £100 a year dating back to 1980 as opposed to 1981. What I am concerned about, is whether that is all it means, namely, that one cannot retrospectively take away something that people have had. I certainly do not see how terms and conditions of employment can be treated backwards, although I accept that it could be done with salary. One might tell the staff that they would have to pay back £1,000, and so on, because last year they had been overpaid. It is complicated but I think that that is what "retrospective" means in respect of reduction of remuneration.<br><br>
However, if someone has had a certain-sized office, for example, or has been teaching a certain number of students under conditions service for a year, how one can have a retrospective alteration of that, I do not understand. One cannot suddenly turn round and say "You ought to have been teaching 35 pupils last year, not 33, therefore we cannot allow you to teach 33. We must do something about it."<br><br>
The provision does not make sense, if that is what it means. In respect of alteration of terms and conditions of service, particularly in the two sectors of colleges of education and central institutions I am keen to see, as a result of this negotiating machinery, their terms and conditions of employment—which are different from those in the further education sector, which will have the largest number both in terms of employers and of staff on the committees—that in the future there will not be an alteration to their detriment. I fear that that might take place. I think, too, that all lecturers and teachers will be concerned that there should be not just no retrospective reduction but no future reduction in their remuneration.<br><br>
This is an aspect that requires a little more explanation so that we may understand what is in the Minister's mind. That is actually not very difficult. We should like to learn exactly what the word "retrospective" means in the clause, and what it would mean if my amendment was accepted. The Minister may accept it—one never knows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment and I ask the Minister to tell us if the word "retrospective" here could be used in the context of conserved salaries. This will become an increasingly controversial matter, I suggest, because as school rolls fall, and the responsibility elements for the vast majority of people working in education in Scotland fall, the question of conserved salaries may be of greater significance. I am talking about cases in which responsibility payments are related to the size of school rolls. In some cases it has been common practice, as school rolls have fallen, that those with a certain period of service will retrospectively have earned the responsibility pay that they are in receipt of.<br><br>
I appreciate that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is preoccupied with the wages and conditions of college of education
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0455">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 807</span>
lecturers. I wonder whether the word "retrospective" is appropriate in that context.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) does not mind, I shall first answer the point raised by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) about the use of the word "retrospective". This is a repetition of the existing provision. If a settlement resulted in a worsening of some aspect of pay and conditions of service, it could not be backdated.<br><br>
The hon Member for Cathcart was in his middle mood—'his remarks were neither to the Left nor to the Right; it was pure middle-of-the-road Labour stuff. The hon Gentleman described the amendment as a probing amendment; I shall not say that it is a wrecking amendment, but I shall try to explain its effect and why I shall either ask the hon Gentleman to withdraw it or hon Members to reject it.<br><br>
Subsection (1) of new section 97A provides for any settlement in the committee to have retrospective effect, subject to the proviso that any reduction in remuneration or any change in conditions of service to the detriment of teachers shall not have retrospective effect. The amendment would simply provide that no such reduction or change may be agreed by the committee in any circumstances.<br><br>
Subsection (1) of new section 97A provides for settlements made in the committee to have retrospective effect and it substantially re-enacts similar provisions in subsection (2) of section 97 of the 1980 Act. It would be undesirable to tie the hands of the committee in the way the amendment proposes. In any event, the terms of the proviso, with the amendment suggested by the hon Member, would no longer make sense in the context of the subsection of which it is part. The hon Member for Cathcart said that the amendment was designed to probe; therefore, in those circumstances, I ask him to consider withdrawing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciated exactly what I was doing when I tabled the amendment and the effect it would have. It was essentially a probing amendment. I am still a little concerned about how there can be retrospective alterations of terms and conditions, though I know one or two instances where that could happen—for example, if someone had been paid too high a petrol allowance over a period.<br><br>
One matter is not covered by the Bill. I speak of existing agreements on conservation of teachers' salaries. Let us take the example of a headmaster in a school where the roll falls. In theory he could be moved down to a lower grade of headmaster in terms of salary. If a new headmaster came in, he would be paid accordingly, but I believe that, under the agreements, the existing headmaster would be paid that salary for five years. Can I assume that, initially, the new negotiating machineries will automatically subsume that kind of conservation agreement into their existing agreements before, perhaps, setting about providing their own conservation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. The answer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 808</span>
is "Yes".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case—to some extent that was the amendment's concern—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 45, line 24, leave out "as his employer thinks fit" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"as is agreed between his employer and the relevant registered trade union."</p></blockquote>
This amendment raises an important issue. It refers to a small number of people only. Subsections (4) and (5) refer to those few whom the negotiating machinery cannot put into a clear slot and, therefore, whose salaries are difficult to decide. But as a trade unionist—I am sure that my hon Friends will support me—I think that it is disgraceful, having come a long way in trying to develop a proper structure for good industrial relations in which trade unions and workers have rights, to have a clause which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The remuneration payable to, and the terms and conditions of employment of, any person to whom this subsection applies may, subject to the provisions of any other enactment and to that person's contract of employment, be such as his employer thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
My amendment seeks to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"as is agreed between his employer and the relevant registered trade union".</p></blockquote>
In other words, if an individual has difficulties which the salary committee takes up and tries to negotiate, that person should, in the meantime, be able to go to his employer with a trade union representative and work out what the correct salary should be. In my view, it should be incorporated into the law, and not left to the vagaries of employers as the subsection seems to read.<br><br>
The Minister may be able to explain the terminology in another way. The Minister may say "This is his Left-wing speech rather than his Social Democratic or Centre one". My trade union hackles rise when I see a phrase saying that people should be paid as the employer thinks fit without any reference to the persons concerned or to a trade union which ought to be negotiating pay.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will tell us why the subsection is phrased in that way. It may be a hangover from ancient days brought forward from previous legislation. Even since the last teachers' negotiating committees were drawn up, the law for trade unions has changed. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us in what circumstances the clause would have effect? Will he also tell us how many times similar provisions have been taken advantage of in the last three years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may not be able to give the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) an immediate reply to his question, but I shall certainly do so eventually.<br><br>
We are asking the hon Member for Glasgow,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 809</span>
Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to withdraw the amendment, or else we shall resist it, because new section 97A(4) and (5) provides for the unlikely case of a teacher who is not covered by any settlement reached in the committee and ensures that he is not left in limbo by enabling his employer to determine his pay and conditions, subject to the provisions of any other enactment and his contract of employment.<br><br>
The provision corresponds to a similar provision in section <i>96</i> of the 1980 Act. There is no guarantee that such a teacher would be a member of any trade union, and my hon Friend sees no need to amend a provision which has successfully—I repeat "successfully"—stood the test of time. But we shall certainly look to see if there is a place for a trade union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that things are improving. I think that is the first time on any amendment that I have spoken to that a Minister has said that he would even look at it. Therefore, I hope that he will look seriously at whether there is a place for the trade union here. It is my view that these cases will arise. I had a case of a teacher who moved to a college of education from special education. There was dispute about what he had been paid as a special education teacher having to live in the school on certain days of the week and whether that should be taken into account in assessing at which point on the lecturers' scale he should be. That is the kind of complicated issue with which we had to deal.<br><br>
It may take a few months for the negotiating committee to decide what is to be done. Those few months can be important to some teachers. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will see that the trade union is involved. It does not follow that the person has to be a member of that trade union. It should be a trade union that would normally represent the teacher even though he might not be a member. Perhaps the Minister will look at this again. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 45, line 35, leave out

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton:</span><span class='membercontribution'> We now turn to amendments that are not exactly frivolous but are not germane to the major part of the clause. They are minor probing amendments of what is perhaps one of the major contentious issues in the clause—namely, arbitration on teachers' salaries and awards. Whilst it is not perhaps the most contentious, it is nevertheless a contentious issue.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 810</span>
Amendments Nos. 251 and 252 would simply follow from the passing of amendment No. 250.<br><br>
My first point is that itshould be the committee's job, with the consent of the Secretary of State—I am giving the Secretary of State some say here—to decide in the very early days of its existence what the negotiation procedures shall be. Its members are in the best position to know. It should not be something that the Secretary of State can impose, albeit following consultation, upon the committee. It is something for the committee, not the Secretary of State, to decide.<br><br>
This matter relates to a point that I made earlier, although not very successfully. These are matters for trade unions and employers—the Minister stated categorically that the Secretary of State is not an employer—to work out and agree. Of course the Secretary of State will be a member of the committee and will take part in the consultation process and the negotiations. But it will be a job for the people who are most expert in this area—people who will have sat on negotiating committees for a long time.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's nominees to these committees tend to be rather transient. They come in, are there for a couple of years and are the_n transferred elsewhere. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was a transient member of a committee because he served for only four years. Others have served considerably longer. The convenor of the EIS salaries committee, Keir Bloomer, has been on the teachers' salary negotiating committee for about 10 years.<br><br>
The committees will need considerable expertise on how best to arrive at decisions and formulate arbitration procedures. We have already dealt with the issue of how best the committees should be set up initially.<br><br>
If a committee were told that an agreement on arbitration must be arrived at soon, I am sure that it would and come up with an arbitration procedure. It would deal with issues such as what should be referred to the arbiter, how it should be referred, whose decision it would be to refer and how many people should be on the arbitration committee. All those issues the committee could take on board and decide.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
Having decided, the committee should then put the matter to the Secretary of State for his consent. I am not taking away the Secretary of State's powers entirely, I am giving him the right to say "No". We feel that he has got it the wrong way round. Instead of the Secretary of State imposing his view and then obtaining the committee's consent, essentially he is now saying that it should be the other way round—the committee arrives at a decision on what is best and the Secretary of State then gives his consent.<br><br>
I need not go further into this. It is self explanatory. I am sure that my hon Friends may wish to say more about it. I know that we will say more about arbitration later.<br><br>
Throughout this procedure the Secretary of State seems to want to have bite after bite of the cherry. He wants to be a member of the committee and to set up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0457">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 811</span>
the arbitration procedure, and, as we shall see later, he also wants the power to overturn what the arbiter decides. He wants to have control over the salaries of teachers in Scotland. If he feels that way, why does he not do away with local authorities, take education completely under his control and do it all himself? That would be easier and it might be what he wants.<br><br>
I think that we should give the committees the power to decide their own future and the way in which they will operate. On one matter, all negotiating committees have to decide for themselves, as I am sure my hon Friends who have served on negotiating committees in the private sector would agree. A decision on arbitration procedure is something that the committee itself arrives at, and that is what my amendment proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is almost complete unanimity among all those who are affected by the new section 97B that the Secretary of State has it the wrong way round. We would be naive to assume that these negotiations are similar to those in private industry, because, at the end of the day, the Secretary of State is the paymaster. He ultimately has to find the money and ultimately can deny the funds. Therefore, when there is a contentious settlement, or inability to reach agreement, surely it is incumbent on the aggrieved parties to have some confidence in the way arbitration takes place. We feel, therefore, that it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to enter into meaningful consultations with both sides of the committee on the most appropriate means whereby such an arbitration arrangement can be arrived at. We take the view that the Secretary of State is assuming far too many powers here and that it would be preferable to allow the committee to consider for itself, in conjunctions with the Secretary of State's representative.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) based his remarks on his experiences with the staff side. But discussions that I have had tend to suggest that the staff side is not happy about the arrangements. Its members do not expect that there will always be a tight-fisted Secretary of State who does not wish to give away a sum of money over a specific amount, and therefore will try always to wreck arbitration arrangements.<br><br>
It could be that, if local authorities were prepared to find the funds, the wage settlement would be acceptable to all concerned, apart from the Secretary of State, who might, for reasons of macro-economic policy, decide that the level is too high. But we can jump that fence when we reach it. We feel that it could be a management initiative where management feels that the workers should be paid more and is therefore prepared to foot the bill.<br><br>
To take account of these situations, it would be preferable for the arbitration arrangements to be settled with the co-operation of the whole committee. We think that the Minister is fundamentally wrong. He has no friends in this matter. We wonder why he is doing this, and we hope that he will explain his reasons, that he will ge a wee bit further than simply reading the notes applying to new section 97B, and say something that goes beyond the brief.<br><br>
As we have repeatedly said, we are getting tired of hearing the Minister. We do not mind listening to him.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 812</span>
He is a lot more co-operative than his hon Friend, we have had concessions from him, he is not as cheeky, and, because he is a reasonable man, we do not have acrimonious discussions about how nasty he is. It is fair of us to be abusive of his hon Friend in his absence, for we were abusive to his face and are not being unduly discourteous now.<br><br>
Given that nobody wants this arrangement, apart from his right hon Friend the Secretary of State, it is incumbent on the Minister to be forthcoming and tell us why he wants this arrangement for the setting up of arbitration procedures. We should be grateful if he would explain it to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must compliment the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) on burning the midnight oil to produce so many amendments. We applaud his industry, if not the subject matter.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments. I have the same objection to them as I have to one or two of the hon Gentleman's other proposals—that they leave something to be settled by agreement within the negotiating committees on which I think it would be difficult to secure agreement.<br><br>
I understand, for instance, that quite different views are held, among interests that one would expect to be represented, on whether access to arbitration should be only by agreement of the two negotiating parties or whether it should be possible for one party unilaterally to force an issue to arbitration. There must be a decision, and I think it is right to provide, as is provided under existing legislation in relation to the Scottish Teachers' Salaries Committee, that the Secretary of State should take it.<br><br>
The next part of what I shall say also covers the points raised by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). I am sorry if one minute he likes my personal reply—I shall not say "off-the-cuff" reply—and does not want the brief, and then the next minute the reverse is true. It is my duty to the Committee to give it the correct answer, and that is why Ministers of this Government—and Ministers of the last Government—stick religiously to their briefs when dealing with complicated subjects.<br><br>
Again, the Committee seems to have a phobia about the Secretary of State's position, which is not much different from that of previous Secretaries of State of both parties in these matters. The locus of the Secretary of State is basically—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the arrangements provided in this clause were similar to the arrangements for arbitration in the current negotiating bodies. Before he goes any further, will he confirm that, because I confess that I cannot remember the details. My understanding and my recollection of it are that these are not the current arrangements for arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I am right, but if not I shall certainly let the hon Member know—today, I hope. But I believe that I am right in what I said.<br><br>
I revert to the question of the Secretary of State. Before prescribing any arrangements for arbitration, the Secretary of State is required under subsection (2) of new section 97B to consult employers and representatives of teaching staff, and it would be wrong to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0458">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 813</span>
pre-empt those consultations by announcing a firm decision now. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has stated that the Government regard it as appropriate, save in special circumstances, that there should be recourse to arbitration only by agreement of the parties. In the consultations which must take place it will be open to those whom we consult to submit that there are special circumstances, and our decision will be taken in the light of our consultations. That shows willingness on the part of the Secretary of State and his advisers to look further at this provision. In these circumstances, I hope that the hon Member for Cathcart may feel willing to seek to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation on what is an important issue. We must consider the background and give thought to the question of arbitration, certainly before the Opposition can accept the somewhat bland reasons why the Minister says that the provision should appear in this fashion.<br><br>
The question of arbitration is important to trade unions in general, and certainly to the teaching profession. The records will show that, through the process of going to ACAS, the arbitration figures are on the increase. More of the business transacted between trade unions and employers is going through this form of arbitration, particularly in respect of school teachers. It is not because the teachers intended that that was the way it should be.<br><br>
Because the employers are hidebound by cash restrictions placed upon them by the Secretary of State for Scotland, whenever there is a dispute between them and the teachers they now hurriedly apply to put the matter to arbitration. This is done because they feel that the arbitrator, through ACAS looking at the case, will see that there is a cash restriction and will most likely put forward the solution within that restriction. At present, therefore, it is the employers who are keen to go to arbitration when any difficulties arise. On the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 814</span>
other hand, the teachers are not keen to go to arbitration, simply because of these cash restrictions. Recent results have shown that their suspicions have been proved correct.<br><br>
If arbitration means anything, there has to be a willingness on both sides to accept the decision arrived at by the arbitrator. The clause, and in particular this part of it, is dubiously written as regards that issue. First, there is a stipulation that the Secretary of State will take the decision on which matter goes to arbitration. After the decision is taken on the arbitrary award, the Secretary of State then has the right to overturn that decision. So, first, we are asking the teachers to accept that the employers may take them to arbitration. They are reluctant to do so. A decision is then taken and can be overruled by the Secretary of State if the arbitrators step outwith the financial restrictions that the right hon Gentleman places on them.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Opposition seemed to have a phobia about the Secretary of State. The right hon Gentleman is responsible for all those matters in Scotland. It is not that we deny him that responsibility. What we are consistently arguing is that sometimes the right hon Gentleman seems to be seizing, almost like a dictator, areas of responsibility which previously he did not rule over. On other occasions, when decisions are likely to be unsavoury or unpalatable, he is prepared, in a mock form of devolution, to hand over the dirty work for somebody else to do.<br><br>
That is the matter that we constantly raise in the Committee—not that the Secretary of State should not be doing those things—but that he is inconsistent. If he wants to dictate terms to local government, let him make all the decisions and see what happens when the cash restrictions that he imposes have to be complied with.</span></p>
