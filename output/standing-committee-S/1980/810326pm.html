<p><i>Question proposed [this day]</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was officially on my feet at one o'clock, although my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) had just intervened to say that we could clear up the matter that I had raised, by tabling an amendment on Report. Because it requires clarification, I should like to hear the Minister's views. <br><br>
At present, sub-paragraphs <i>3(b)</i> (i) and (ii), run together. In other words, members of an appeal committee have to be
<br><blockquote><p>"(i) parents of children of school age"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"(ii) persons who in the opinion of the authority have experience in education".</p></blockquote>
That is followed by the word "or". If that word were put down to go into paragraph 3(<i>b</i>) (iii), that would imply that it was a separate category, so that a member of an appeal committee could fall into paragraphs 3(<i>b</i>) (i) and (ii) or paragraph 3(<i>b</i>) (iii).<br><br>
However, I am concerned because, as it reads at present, sub-paragraph 3(<i>b</i>) (iii) means that only parents whom the education authority regards as having some educational experience can serve on a committee. That raises two points. First, the paragraph should not be limited in that way; any parents who have children of school age should be able to serve on the committee, except for those whom we excluded in the previous amendment. For instance, the director of education, as well as others, may have children of school age who fall into that category. But apart from such people, any parents should be eligible. If they are not, what do we mean by the phrase "experience in education?". Anyone who has been at school has had experience of education.<br><br>
If it means that, there is no point in including subparagraph 3(<i>b</i>) (ii). But if it does not mean that, we are reaching a classification that says that middle-class parents who have worked in the education service, presumably as teachers or at an equivalent level, can serve on an appeal committee. Therefore, working-class parents would be excluded. That emphasises our point about parental choice—that it will mainly benefit only those middle-class parents who are able to articulate their views. If the appeal committee has that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
sort of class structure, it cannot do the job that the Government intended.<br><br>
Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister could explain that matter. If my interpretation is wrong, he should introduce an amendment to make the meaning clear. If my interpretation is right, I shall consider joining my hon Friends in tabling an amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3(<i>b</i>) means that any one of those qualifications would be sufficient for someone to become a member of an appeal committee. The paragraph merely seeks to guide the local authority about the sort of experience that is to be looked for when appointing members to that committee. Therefore sub-paragraphs 3(<i>b</i>)(i), (ii) and (iii) are not cumulative, but are separate qualifications so that no amendment is necessary.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman will want to know that I consulted the draftsman to ensure that the interpretation that I have just given was correct. He has given me that assurance, so the Committee should be satisfied with what I have said.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Chair's enthusiasm to group as many amendments together as possible has meant that my remarks will not start from the point at which the main amendment starts. But I am sure that we shall be debating this matter for some time, and we shall arrive at the beginning eventually.<br><br>
I begin with amendment No. 121. It has the effect of introducing what could be called a mini-clause stand part debate, because basically it seeks to delete all references in the initial stages to the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
The Opposition are opposed in every way to the assisted places scheme. We regard it as an implied slight against the local authority system of education at secondary level. We do not see that there is anything particularly wrong with the local authority system, which requires the Government to spend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As we are just beginning to debate these amendments, the Committee had better be clear that either we range wide in our discussions as if this were a clause stand part debate, and therefore dispense with the clause stand part debate, or I must keep the Committee strictly to the terms of the amendments. It is a matter for the Opposition to decide which they prefer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point has to be made, Mr. Gourlay, that this is a large clause. It covers many things. Amendment No. 121 takes the scheme as a whole. We are talking in this context of the principles upon which the scheme rests. I think that need not necessarily prejudice a wide-ranging clause stand part debate. Nevertheless, when I used the expression "clause stand part" I did so in the sense that this area could be taken as a whole. Because the amendment has been selected along with a group of others, I felt it appropriate to use that as the starting point. Obviously, if the amendment is defeated, the others will have to be considered. If the amendment is carried, the others will fall. I am not endeavouring to range widely.<br><br>
It is essential, when we are discussing the assisted places scheme and the privileged treatment that will be granted to one sector of education in Scotland—secondary education of a fee-paying nature—to take account
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
of its impact on the other sector of education provided by local authorities. I was hoping to develop my case along that line, and I hope that it is not out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is quite right in advancing his argument on that basis. But I was trying to indicate that, when the Chair came to consider whether there should be a clause stand part debate, if we had had a fairly wide discussion on the principle of the assisted places scheme under amendment No. 121, it would not be relevant to go over the same ground again. That is why I am giving the hon Member plenty of advance notice of how the debate will be ruled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is probably right, Mr. Gourlay. I would prefer it if we had a long clause stand part debate, where we could refer to specific amendments rather than have a series of narrow debates on each amendment. I think that it would be preferable from our point of view, with due respect to my hon Friend, if we had a wider debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall proceed, and perhaps when we reach clause stand part one of your colleagues whose vision may not be quite as restrictive as yours, Mr. Gourlay, will be in the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. While I would not accept the hon Gentleman's remarks as a stricture on my conduct, it would be out of order to compare my rulings with those of my co-Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for casting aspersions on either you or your alter ego, Mr. Gourlay. I withdraw that remark. However, I shall not ask for it to be withdrawn from the record, because I regard a similar request, made this morning, as almost a breach of parliamentary privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) made a very moderate and sensitive speech this morning, but his sensibilities were so offended that he had to leave in a state of near nausea.<br><br>
We regard the assisted places scheme as being inimical to the development of the local authority sector of education, and we consider it to be a slight on those who serve in that sector and a slight on those who are associated with it as parents. Furthermore, we consider that an unfortunate effect of the proposal would be that the subsidy which would go to the private sector would appear to be at the expense of the local authority sector.<br><br>
Another effect would be the creaming off of more able youngsters in some parts of the country. I say "some parts of the country" because we know that the geographical spread of these schools, which will be involved in the assisted places scheme, is of a very restricted nature and that there are wide areas of the country which would not benefit.<br><br>
That is all that I intend to say about the generalities in support of amendment No. 121. I have merely outlined my case and not developed it, so I hope that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
it will not preclude further discussion in a stand part debate. I hope that your normally generous handling of these matters, Mr. Gourlay, will enable us to return to the matter. I have merely, for the purposes of conciseness, touched on the matter in a sort of heading form rather than try to go into any great detail at this stage.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 120 seeks to replace the Secretary of State, as the source of funds, with the trustees and boards of governors of these institutions. We believe that many of the institutions which would be receiving money from the Secretary of State—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stealing the money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —are well able to provide the funds themselves to finance the assisted places scheme. They have trusts which have been built up over a number of years. One can think of the vast personal fortune which was endowed to an institution such as George Heriot's, when jingling Georgie, the founder of one of the great banks in England, returned to Scotland with his great wealth. We shall not ask where that wealth came from, or by what means it was acquired, but that money was used to set up a hospital for poor children in Edinburgh. I gather that there are still substantial landholdings and investments within the city of Edinburgh on which George Heriot's trust is founded. In the Merchant Company schools in Edinburgh and schools such as Glasgow academy substantial amounts are available to the boards of governors and trustees. The Opposition feel that any scheme should be an extension of the schemes which have been used in the past to meet the Government's objectives.<br><br>
We do not agree with those objectives. We shall go into that matter in the clause stand part debate, as we did on Second Reading. We do not accept the educational or philosophical premises on which the arguments are based, but if we set aside our objections and say that, if the private sector schools wish to attract young people from homes where parents cannot afford the fees, the schools should provide the money themselves by using their own investments, which are more than adequate to meet the expenditure entailed.<br><br>
We are also aware that for tax purposes those schools are considered to be charities. Many Opposition Members feel that Labour Chancellors in the past have missed opportunities to look more closely at the tax position of those institutions, their charitable status and their opportunities for rate relief. While we accept that this matter could be raised on the Finance Bill, if those institutions enjoy charitable status, they should act more like charities. We gather that the number of places made available to those who cannot normally afford to go to these institutions is restricted.<br><br>
In some institutions, such as the Merchant Company schools and George Watson's in Edinburgh, there are arrangements whereby children of Church of Scotland ministers are accepted at cheap rates. We know that the bairns of teachers in these schools can also get in cheap. In regard to amendment No. 120, we take the view that if there is to be a private sector in education, it should be financially independent of central Government, and that if private schools wish to operate an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
assisted places scheme, they should do it from within their own resources. The amendment therefore seeks to replace the Secretary of State, as a source of funds, by the trustees and the boards of governors.<br><br>
We accept that that may not be the appropriate jargon, and the Minister may tell us that the amendment is defective in this respect. But he may agree with the thrust of our argument that it is desirable to curtail unnecessary public expenditure—into which category we would put these payments. If he accepts the thrust of our arguments, we shall be happy to allow the amendment to be withdrawn so that we can return to it on Report, when a more appropriate amendment can be framed by the draftsmen so that our point can be taken on board.<br><br>
Amendment No. 118 was suggested after a reading of the 1979 Tory manifesto. This document is not my bedside reading, but I should like to quote from a paragraph on page 29 about parents' rights and responsibilities:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Grant Aided schools, whose grant is being phased out by Labour, give wider opportunities for bright children from modest backgrounds. We will restore the real value of the grant in these schools and in the longer term discuss with them the possibility of opening up the system more widely."</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading, I and many of my colleagues pressed the Minister repeatedly to state by what means the selection of young people for the assisted places scheme would be made. We were interested to know how the schools would choose the children who were to benefit from the scheme. We asked the Minister how he would determine which children were the bright ones. We have tabled amendment No. 118 to find out whether, if the Minister is to use the word that was used in the Conservative manifesto, he can indicate to us how the ability of young people to benefit from that form of education will be assessed.<br><br>
We do not accept the meritocratic approach to education, especially in terms of entry into secondary education. At the heart of the comprehensive debate lay the argument—an argument that has, by and large, been accepted—that because of the consequences of the qualifying examination, as it was called in Scotland, in terms of the pain and anguish suffered in many households, it was not a desirable means of establishing the suitability of young people for particular courses of education. We therefore sought to end that system, and in the local authority sector in Scotland, it has been accepted that an examination at 12-plus is not a desirable way of determining the suitability of young people to pursue particular courses in secondary school.<br><br>
The amendment to insert the word "bright" is a probing amendment, and we will seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw it. We want to find out whether the Minister is serious about the use of the word in the manifesto—although I accept that he was not the author of that manifesto. We also want to consider the means whereby children will be selected or rejected for the scheme.<br><br>
Some of us have grave misgivings about the scheme. They will become plain during our debates and I will not describe them now for fear of constraining my hon Friends at a later stage. I hope that I shall not have to keep repeating my remark about clause stand part, but I am getting a wee bit paranoid about it, and I want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
make it clear that we hope that any general references that we may make will not be prejudicial to the consideration of other parts of the Bill at a later stage.<br><br>
We do not like the assisted places scheme. We do not believe that there is a great deal of attraction for young people in local authority schools in being able to benefit from the assisted places scheme and attend grant-aided independent schools. If more than 1,500 youngsters want to go to those schools, we should like to know how the schools will select them.<br><br>
It is incumbent on the Minister to provide us with a clear accurate description of the Department's intentions in this matter, because before we proceed further we are anxious to have some idea of how the Minister would seek to operate the system. In many respects our arguments may depend on that. I do not know whether the Minister wishes to intervene to tell us what he proposes. The Committee may find it useful to have his views now, although I realise that he is deeply engrossed in other work, and that he is paying no attention to the debate. Perhaps he can listen to a debate and read at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall wait with interest for the Minister's reply to amendments Nos. 118 and 119, which are similar to each other. Amendments Nos. 126, 127 and 128 are in the name of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). He tabled them because he felt it desirable to have consultations before the implementation of any assisted places scheme.<br><br>
The Minister will doubtless tell us that there has been a great deal of consultation already—that he has spoken to the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, the Scottish Consumer Council, COSLA, the STUC and the EIS and other teaching organisations. He may have spoken to them and he may have listened to them, but, from what we can gather, he has not taken on board their objections. I do not think that any of the organisations that I mentioned support the assisted places scheme. Even if the Bill were to become law— and we dearly hope that it will not—we hope that he would speak to those people again to fulfil his obligations to consult them before any steps were taken to make this odious scheme a reality.<br><br>
We are not happy about the manner in which the consultative processes have been undertaken. In this instance we recognise them to be something of a sham, because the Minister, who has a deep ideological commitment to this scheme, has chosen to ignore completely the views of all those involved in education. Even some of the schools concerned were not too happy about the scheme, because, from what I know, they preferred to obtain money under the old system and to do what they liked.<br><br>
In some respects, that point may link up with amendment No. 120. As I said earlier, if the schools wish to operate that sort of scheme, they should be able to do so, because they have their own resources. At the same time, I am aware that no organisation likes to spend money when it can get it free, gratis and for nothing from the Government. The new scheme may mean that the Government will direct some of the money so,<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
that those schools may have less independence than before.<br><br>
5.00 pm<br><br>
We believe that if the private sector in education is to exist, it should exist independently, without any State aid or assistance. We should, I think, over the years perhaps try a bit harder than we have in the past to ensure that the link between the Treasury and the private sector in education is severed as quickly as possible. If there is to be a private sector in education, we should ensure that it is completely independent of the taxpayer.<br><br>
The Minister should remember that his hon Friend the Minister responsible for health and social security— and, indeed, he himself on occasions—has talked about spending taxpayers' money. We argued earlier that the expenditure of taxpayers' money for a deserving and disadvantaged group of people who were incapable of helping themselves was not an unreasonable way of using the contents of the public purse.<br><br>
However, if the young people who would benefit from the scheme have to pass an examination to be assessed on their ability to study, assimilate information and exercise their critical faculties, they would not need to go to independent or grant-aided schools if they jumped those educational hurdles. They would benefit from the provision in local authority schools and so would not need the opportunities which are supposed to be available in the independent sector.<br><br>
We do not consider that the children who would go through the scheme are in any way disadvantaged in terms of their abilities. The provision within local authority schools is, in the main, extremely good, although it is getting worse, because of the starvation of funds by the Government. Teacher-pupil ratios will rise because of the cut backs. Warnings have already been sounded by the General Teaching Council of Scotland about the standards in education, which in some respects, I concede, have to be measured in terms of global and bald examination results.<br><br>
The examination results are the criteria which the Minister chooses to use as a means of comparison between one school and another. The General Teaching Council, which advised the Minister, said that standards would fall if teacher-pupil ratios continued to rise. If that is the case, perhaps what we see is a vicious circle. The local authority sector is starved of funds. It is made less attractive to large numbers of children who will then sit for examinations and find their way into the independent sector. It will be a directive incentive to young people to go into the independent sector, and the level of subsidy which will go into the independent sector because of that will enable these schools to be sustained at a time when educationally and socially they have begun to appear as an anachronism in our social structure.<br><br>
I shall return to those matters after the Minister has replied to the debate. The amendments lie at the very heart of the whole issue. I have tried to advance my argument in a fairly narrow and restricted manner, in accordance with the guidelines laid down at the beginning. Therefore, I hope that we shall have the opportunity to discuss the matter on several occasions before we reach the end of clause stand part.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
The clause is fairly lengthy. It has various regulations and other implications on which we shall have to take some considerable time. I am grateful to the Minister for making available to us consultative papers, and so on. I do not know whether that will be a great advantage to him, because if an Opposition are well informed, they often have more information than the Minister would like. But in the interests of open government, we are certainly grateful to the Minister.<br><br>
There are quite a few issues that we have yet to raise, and I shall be brief to allow some of my hon Friends to take part in the debate. I know that we have only a short sitting this evening. I am sure that when we return on Tuesday we shall be able to consider the clause again and examine the arguments afresh.<br><br>
The Opposition object to the scheme. We consider it completely irrelevant to the needs of Scottish education and to the young people of Scotland. We think that it will exacerbate social and economic divisions in the country at a time when the economy is already imposing severe and harmful strains on our social structure. Therefore, I move amendment No. 121 to delete the scheme altogether, amendment No. 120 to insist that if there is such a scheme it will be funded—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I should take this opportunity to guide the Committee. The procedure in Committee is that when a group of amendments has been selected for debate the hon Member rising to move, moves the first amendment in the group, and eventually the Committee votes on such other amendments as the Chair has selected for Division. So the hon Member is not moving amendment No. 121. He is merely moving amendment No. 126. But that does not preclude discussion on the other amendments, nor Divisions on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for that information. Had I been engaged on a high flight of oratory, I should probably have said that I was on what would be called, somewhat pompously, my peroration. Now I do not know whether I must wind up again, or wind down and begin all over again.<br><br>
I was endeavouring to give a brief resume of the points that I had made to give the Minister—who I know is very interested in what I was saying, although he has missed a great deal of what I have said because of his other responsibilities—the rubric of the argument once again. We believe that if there is to be an assisted places scheme for independent schools, it should be funded by the institutions themselves, because we believe that they have adequate funds to meet such a scheme.<br><br>
As to the method of selection for such a scheme, we suggest that if the Conservative Party is to be true to its election manifesto, it will find that that results in some form of selection by examination to establish the brightness or otherwise of young people. We should find that out of step with the progress that has been made in the past 16 years, since circular 5/65, which suggested to local authorities that they introduce comprehensive education.<br><br>
As a former education committee man on Fife county council, you will know only too well, Mr. Gourlay, that many years ago local authorities in Scotland blazed a trail for comprehensive education,<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
so the traditional type of education system in Scotland is the comprehensive system. Therefore, this scheme is running completely against the grain of education opinion in our country.,<br><br>
I know that my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) will be introducing his own amendments in his robust and idiosyncratic style. At the heart of those very moderate and reasonable amendments lies the principle of consultation, which I am sure is at the heart of the democratic process and of the best tradition of our society, and in many respects of our education system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few remarks on the amendments. I should like to concentrate especially on the last two amendments in the group.<br><br>
In particular, I wish to reiterate what the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said—that in dealing with the assisted places scheme we are legislating for about 2 per cent, of the school population. It is ridiculous that an education Bill should deal with that small percentage, to the exclusion of the large number of children who attend our neighbourhood and comprehensive schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member started with an important statement—that we were dealing with 2 per cent, of the school population, to the exclusion, therefore, of the rest. In fact, the scheme that we are putting forward now will provide an opportunity, for those families who are interested, for 85 per cent, of the population of Scotland, because 85 per cent, of the population will be within 25 miles of a school running an assisted places scheme. Transport will be available as part of the funding of the scheme to enable families living within 25 miles of a school to take advantage of it.<br><br>
The number of schools in the scheme has doubled. There were 22 schools in the direct grant scheme and 42 schools will be in the assisted places scheme. So there is a big advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: am surprised by that intervention by the Minister, because he is seeking to create a mirage, to give the impression that the independent system will expand marvellously to take in up to 85 per cent, of the Scottish school population. He knows and I know that we are dealing with a small proportion. I notice that he was careful not to say how many pupils would be eligible to get into the 42 schools. How many of those will be in Edinburgh? This is largely an Edinburgh clause—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —to deal with the peculiar, aberrant system of education that exists in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should get his facts right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has given some alleged facts, but I am not sure that he has them right. They distort and create entirely the wrong impression. They are intended to create that impression, because I am sure that the Minister—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. While the debate is enjoyable, there should not be too many sedentary interruptions— [<i>Interruption.</i>]—especially not referring to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that some Conservative hon Members—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hooligans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet reached the list D school system, but I would say that re-education will be necessary, especially in good manners.<br><br>
The Minister was provoking me, because he grotesquely made use of information which would create a mirage. It is not the case that 85 per cent, of the Scottish school population will be able to get into the schools with assisted places. I hope that he accepts that.<br><br>
The object of this part of the Bill is to give respectability to the independent sector and to expand its operations. A booklet called "Scottish Education— Regaining a Lost Reputation," written by those experts in the education system, the hon Members for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) and for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), and published by the Scottish Conservative Party, which is renowned for its distorting publications, says at page 4:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, we believe that choice should not be limited to the state sector. The Grant-Aided schools provide both an important independent yardstick against which the achievements of the State sector can be judged and also a further element of choice."</p></blockquote>
It that was intended to be the reason behind the changes that are coming in—the broadening of a system—the amendments, which relate to the possible introduction of intelligence tests or selectivity, are relevant.<br><br>
If it is the Government's intention to use the private, independent or grant-aided sector as a yardstick, they must insist that that sector adopt the same rules as the other parts of the education system. If, however, the Government want the independent sector to cream off some of the more able pupils and to provide higher staffing standards and what might be considered to be advantages in terms of a very selective structure, the comparison will be unfair. One will be comparing one thing with something that is entirely different.<br><br>
The comprehensive sector relies upon its feeder primary schools and takes into its secondary schools the pupils from the area, who can be averaged out according to age and general intelligence, whereas the selective schools will apparently be able to pick and choose from the whole community. It will not, therefore, be possible to make a fair comparison between the public and the independent sectors. Such a comparison would not give the Scottish Education Department much guidance on standards of education.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister some questions about the operation of the clause, questions bearing upon the amendments we are discussing. I note that the Minister frequently wanders away from his desk and does not listen to debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman blame my hon Friend?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is what the hon Gentleman is paid for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give credit to other hon Gentlemen. Even if the debate is boring, the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has the courtesy to stay in his seat, but the Minister has to get up and wander about the Committee Room as if the only way in which he can participate in the debate is to disrupt the exchange of ideas that is taking place—or because he is in constant need of education from his advisers. In either case, the Committee would appreciate it if the Minister would stay at his deck and perhaps try to listen to some of the arguments. I fear, however, that the Government put on their ideological blinkers before they look at clause 5 and that, try as we may, it will be very difficult to shake them from their commitment to this misjudged alteration to our education system.<br><br>
Is it the Minister's intention to ensure that the children of every parent who fits into the means side of the scheme will be able to enter the private sector, or is it his intention to allow the schools concerned to hold examinations or tests—the tests that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—is so keen on— or to make assessments of some kind which will be intended to cream off some of the more able pupils?<br><br>
Secondly, what is the Minister's intention in relation to the ordering of those who apply for admission? What standards will be deployed in the selection of pupils under the scheme? What rules does the Minister intend to make and apply in relation to the independent sector, or does he intend to allow the independent sector to make up its own mind and make its own rules, even though it will be in receipt of considerable public finance?<br><br>
The scheme does not answer in any way the grave education problems that are likely to appear when the school rolls fall and the cutbacks in Government expenditure takes place. It would seem that the independent sector is being given opportunities that will not be available to the public sector.<br><br>
I should be the last to say that the public sector is so perfect that the Government should not seek to improve conditions in the schools to which, I repeat, 98 per cent, of our children go. There will be a crisis in the public sector because schoolchildren are finding that they cannot get jobs when they leave school, and the motivation for learning is changing.<br><br>
However, even before the depression hit us there was a newspaper report by Chris Mollinger in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 25 April last year which showed that there would be a high drop-out rate among 16-year-olds in Scotland. More than 60 per cent, leave school at the earliest opportunity—one of the highest proportions in Western Europe. Unless Government policies have a dramatic impact, the figure will remain virtually unchanged by 1999. Since the raising of the school-leaving age, there has been no significant increase in the number of young people staying on beyond the age of 16. Similarly, the further education system has remained virtually the same for 15 years, with little evidence that that sector is attracting more youngsters who have turned 16.<br><br>
The problem is that the Government seem to be devoting resources towards the private sector. They seem to be willing to adopt a scheme which may cause problems to certain schools in the public sector by denuding them of some of the more able pupils to whom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
these schools look to provide the background or ethos of education within the school and an inspiration to the younger pupils who are making their way up.<br><br>
The Government's philosophy is antagonistic to the concept of public education which we have developed in Scotland. I make this serious criticism of the Government. They offer no answer to the educational problems to which I have just referred; They are avoiding the difficulties which are already arising in schools. They are not setting out to encourage pupils to stay on at school. They ignore that aspect entirely, and they have gone in for this scheme which, frankly, I regard as immoral and antagonistic to our system of education.<br><br>
There can be no justification for setting the independent sector on some kind of pedestal, supported by State money. If the independent sector is to play its part, it can exist, but in no circumstances should it receive assistance from public funds when those funds are so badly needed within the State school system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon Gentleman object to those bright working-class children from Fintry, Linlathen and Midcraigie being given the opportunity to go to Dundee high school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would give them the opportunity of going to local schools to get the first-class education available at those schools. I hope that the hon Gentleman is not casting aspersions on any of the schools in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon Gentleman that, unlike him, I went to school in his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that, from my own experience, I believe that the quality of education has improved dramatically—either that or the quality of the pupils has improved.<br><br>
What the hon Gentleman has just said does not in any way affect the major part of my argument, which is that the concentration of effort must be on the State school system and on improving standards there. The Government's proposal, which seems to be based upon selectivity and the denuding of ordinary schools of talent that would otherwise go to them and be helpful to them in the general education provision, is antisocial.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's replies to my questions. They were spawned by the amendments which raised the whole question whether the Government intend to encourage the private sector to go for selectivity and abandon the general concept of education which we have built up in Scotland over the past 25 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now moving on to the most contentious and obnoxious clause of the Bill. It is worth pointing out at the outset that one of the first things that the Conservative Government did on coming into office was to cut education expenditure in the public sector—for which the Secretary of State had prime responsibility—and at the same time increase the amount of money in grant aid to grant-aided fee-paying schools from £900,000 to £2.3 million, an increase of about 150 per cent. They followed that up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
with a further increase of about 50 per cent., so the total amount of public money going in grant aid to fee-paying selective schools is now about £3| million. The Government are trying an old con trick here. They claim that they are not really increasing the amount of money to private fee-paying schools—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it appropriate for the Minister again to indulge in his disruptive habit of walking deliberately to his advisers in the middle of an hon Member's speech, with the sole intention of preventing the hon Gentleman from delivering his remarks to the Committee and enlightening us upon the effect of the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just rude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It should be understood that any member of the Committee is perfectly at liberty to leave the Committee as and when he wishes. If the Minister requires to seek information elsewhere, that is a matter for him. I think that the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) may resume his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It is one thing for the Minister to leave the Committee—we all recognise the demands of nature which result in such movements—but what we find offensive is the way in which the Minister swans around the room chatting with his colleagues, as well as seeking advice. That is what is causing annoyance and distracting hon Members who are speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member for West Stirlingshire may resume his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. The Government are pretending that what they are doing is not increasing the amount of public money paid to private fee-paying schools. They claim that they are simply switching to the assisted places scheme resources that are already going to grant-aided schools by way of direct grant.<br><br>
That is sheer deceit. As I pointed out, one of the first things that the Government did was to more than double the amount of grant aid to fee-paying schools. The previous Labour Government was in the process of phasing out grant aid altogether. It is a pity that they did not chop it all in one instead of attempting to phase it out over a five-year period. So the Tory Government, as soon as they took office in 1979, increased the amount by 150 per cent., and now the proposed increase is from £900,000 to £3 J million.<br><br>
In other words, the Government have almost quadrupled the amount of taxpayers' money going to that purpose. I hope that the Minister responsible for health is listening, because he is always bleating about taxpayers' money. He was on about it this morning and on Tuesday, saying that there was a limit to the amount of taxpayers' money available. They are grossly increasing the money going to the private sector while applying a hatchet to the amount going into public sector schools, which cater for more than 95 per cent, of schoolchildren in Scotland.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon Gentleman recognise that the aim and intention is to steer money away from the disabled towards the able?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be what the Government are doing. They should redistribute whatever resources are available. I suppose that there is a limit to them, although the limitations cannot be as extreme as the Government pretend. If we had a Secretary of State who would fight within the Cabinet for Scottish education instead of kowtowing to other Cabinet Ministers, especially Treasury Ministers, we might have more resources to redistribute.<br><br>
But, whatever the limitations, what possible moral, educational or financial justification can there be for channelling whatever limited resources are available in such a way that some children—the sons and daughters of the privileged—will get more money while those who are dealt with in the Warnock report and under clause 4 will not get an extra penny?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I know that the hon Gentleman is ferocious in argument, even when he is being polite or informative, but I cannot let him go on in that vein, saying that money provided under the Bill for assisted places will go to anyone other than low-income families, mainly working-class—those whom he pretends to represent in the House but whose interests he is never in favour of advancing because he represents all the bureaucracy and organisation of local government every time that he speaks. Never once does the hon Gentleman think what his constituents, including low-income families, might want for their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'> Not all people in West Stirlingshire are working-class. There is quite a big stockbroker belt, and I try to look after the educational interests of children in that area as well as the working-class children in the industrialised part of my constituency. The way that the Minister is going, there will soon be no working-class people left in my constituency, or anywhere else. They will all be out of a job, because he is destroying jobs as well as educational opportunities in Scotland.<br><br>
I think that the Minister knows the area about which I am talking. I remember a recent debate in Killearn. Killearn cannot possibly be described as a deprived working-class area. There are many parents there— professional people and some with an agricultural background—who want a replacement school or an extension to an existing school. I tell them that the Government are already spending £3| million on the private sector of education and that that figure will increase in the years to come. I warn the Minister that many people who formerly voted Tory are now flocking into the Labour camp because they see that the Minister's education policies are extreme to the limit and are damaging educational opportunity for their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should be debating the amendments before the Committee, not having a clause stand part debate or a general debate on education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay. May I say before leaving that point that I have never detected any enthusiasm for an assisted places scheme
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
among my constituents, whether working-class, middle-class, professional class, unemployed or of no class at all. Not one parent has told me that he supports the assisted places scheme. This scheme has no friends apart from, perhaps, a few sycophantic Tory supporters in small pockets of the bourgeoisie of Edinburgh. Those are the people that the scheme is designed to help. To claim that it will help working-class children is a misunderstanding of—indeed, an insult to—the educational priorities of working-class families.<br><br>
I have here a tawdry leaflet put out by the Government—the "Brief guide for parents". At the very start it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's assisted places scheme is designed to widen the range of educational opportunity in Scotland and to give parents a greater choice of school."</p></blockquote>
That is a lie. The assisted places scheme will do nothing to improve educational opportunities for the vast majority of children in Scotland. If we are to switch resources, we ought to be switching them in favour of those who are most in need instead of taking resources away from them and lining the pockets of the privileged few who want to buy extra privilege—real or imaginary —by sending their children to private fee-paying schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a suggestion to the hon Gentleman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: shall give way provided that the Minister is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman referred to his constituents. I do not think he has tried hard enough. Some of his constituents feel so aggrieved that they write to other Members of Parliament, such as myself. One of the hon Gentleman's constituents wrote to me last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: His complaint was that it was a shame that he was represented by the hon Gentleman. He sent me a cutting from a newspaper recalling the fact that at
<br><blockquote><p>"that notorious Wembley event two years ago when the pitch was invaded and the goals and pitch desecrated, Canavan, a schoolteacher, was one of the first onto the pitch."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: do not know what connection that intervention has with the amendment, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that if the Minister cares to name the person who wrote that letter, or send me a copy, I shall be able to reply to it. That is just more Tory propaganda designed to discredit the moderate Member for West Stirlingshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for the Minister to keep correspondence that should be the preserve of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)? That is a most unethical approach to the handling of constituency business. I do not know whether it constitutes a breach
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
of parliamentary privilege, Mr. Gourlay. Perhaps you could give us your guidance on that. The least that the Under-Secretary could do would be to pass on such correspondence so that my hon Friend could reply to it in his normal moderate and reasonable fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member's remarks are quite interesting, but that is not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay. The subject of football hooliganism is not immediately relevant to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there are any hooligans here, they are the hon Gentlemen who voted to administer corporal punishment even to the handicapped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that the hon Gentleman finished that speech before lunch. Will he turn his attention to the amendments we are considering?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. I turn to the amendments. Education authorities have a statutory responsibility to provide education for children in their areas, and it would be an insult to those authorities if no attempt was made to consult them beforehand about the effects of the assisted places scheme on the public sector education provided within their areas. It was no good for the Minister to argue, as he did on Tuesday night, that he could not abolish corporal punishment tomorrow, even for handicapped children, because he had to consult the education authorities, which had to consult COSLA, which had to consult the teachers' unions, and so on. It was sheer hypocrisy for him to say that on the issue of corporal punishment. But he will now deny the opportunity of adequate consultation in respect of seeking approval from the education authorities for the operation of the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
I said that I could detect very little enthusiasm for the assisted places scheme among parents and education authorities in my constituency. However, I should perhaps qualify that statement, because the only enthusiastic supporter of the scheme in my constituency appears to be the Secretary of State. But he is a product of the private fee-paying school sector anyway, so I do not think that he knows much about what goes on in the average school in West Stirlingshire or anywhere else. It is often said that the only time that some Tory Members of Parliament go to Scottish schools is on voting day.<br><br>
The Minister might want to comment on this subject, because he published a provisional list of participating schools in December 1980. There is only one of those schools in Central region—the Dollar academy. I know that my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire might wish to comment on that academy later. But it is true to say that there has been interaction between Dollar academy and the other local education authority schools in that area.<br><br>
The way in which Dollar academy has been allowed to operate for many years has not always benefited children who attend schools that are near it. Central region bears that in mind, and that is partly why the education authority there is absolutely opposed to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
assisted places scheme. That is not the reason why there is only one Central region school that is on the provisional list. I do not care whether there is only one school, half a dozen schools, or whatever. The scheme is badly thought-out and disastrous and is designed to benefit the privileged few. It will not benefit the majority of children educated in LEA schools at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend referred to Dollar academy, which is in my constituency. I imagine that the Minister would say that it was within travelling distance—namely, the 25-mile radius that he mentioned at the beginning of his remarks. That 25-mile radius could cover some aspects of the matter. However, would not my hon Friend agree that there would be considerable travelling from, say Bannockburn to Dollar every day? There would also be difficulty in getting there from Airth, Killin or any of the mining villages where working people live and where there is tremendous interest in education—although that degree of interest would preclude them from wanting their children to go to schools like that. But if those young people chose to go, it would be an expensive and lengthy business to undertake on a daily basis. In practice, it would be impossible for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. To talk about a radius of 25 miles is ridiculous when one realises that children would have to undertake a round trip of 50 miles every day. Most parents in areas such as Bannockburn, Fillan, Plean, Kerry, Denny, and so on, would have nothing to do with this crazy scheme. They realise that adequate educational opportunity is provided in their own areas, and that, although it may not be perfect, it can be improved by channelling more resources into the LEA schools rather than by putting public money into the private sector.<br><br>

Central region has only one school on the provisional list, and Central region council has made it clear that it wants to have nothing to do with the scheme. If the Minister imagines that he will get co-operation from local education authorities in administering or advertising the scheme—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not need it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —then he has another thought coming, because the Labour-controlled education authorities have been strongly advised by me, and by other hon Members, to have nothing whatsoever to do with advertising the scheme or co-operating in the administration of it.<br><br>
The provisional list contains 14 schools in Strathclyde region, which covers half of Scotland's population, but the biggest concentration of schools in the assisted places scheme is in Lothian region. There is only one in Central region. There is only one in Dumfries and Galloway region, and only one in Fife. There are three m Grampian, one in Highland, seven in Tayside and 14 in Lothian region.<br><br>
It is interesting that included in the provisional list are schools which were formerly called grant-aided schools, which received a grant-in-aid of public money— taxpayers' money, as the Under-Secretary, the hon

Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), keeps reminding us. These schools have been receiving taxpayers' money for years by way of direct grant. But many of the schools on the provisional list are not the former grant-aided schools. Many of them, at present, are independent schools.<br><br>
Loretto school in Edinburgh is listed, as is the Rudolf Steiner school, which I think is an independent school. Also listed is St. Dennis—the good Lord St. Dennis; I do not think that that was named after me— and St. George's, which will be named after Mr. Speaker, and various others.<br><br>
Fettes College is an independent school. Some of the schools are reluctant to give information on how they are run and their philosophy. I went to considerable trouble to get a copy of the Fettes College prospectus. It is very interesting. The full boarding fees for the junior school are £245 per term. Weekly boarding is £195 per term. The tuition fees are £485 per term. These fees are subject to periodical review. I would imagine that the senior school fees would be even higher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find the hon Gentleman's remarks far removed from amendment No. 126 and some of the others. I suggest that perhaps he might return to the main aspect of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could assist my hon Friend. The tuition fees for Fettes upper college are £750 per term for day pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend for that useful information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that if fees of this order are being charged, surely these schools and the trustees and the boards of governors do not need handouts from the State to allow the children of the deserving poor to attend. Surely, they get enough money from the fees that they charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the debate on amendments allows us to discuss the fees to that extent. In any case, the fees to which the hon Gentleman referred are excluded from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to build up my argument to show that what goes on, or does not go on, in Fettes college could, in fact, affect the children who are in LEA schools in the Lothian region. I quote from the Fettes college prospectus:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fettes is one of the great British public schools. For over a century it has sought to instil qualities of integrity, intellectual awareness and self-reliance that have equipped Fettesians, including three Chancellors of the Exchequer in the middle part of this century, to render uniquely influential service in England, Scotland and many countries overseas."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>An Hon Member</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Land of hope and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No wonder that the country is in an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
economic mess when three Chancellors of the Exchequer were former pupils of that school.<br><br>
I suggest that this country's present economic mess must be due in some measure to these former pupils of Fettes college. Therefore, I doubt the quality of education which is on offer there. I notice that the school carefully omits to mention one of its other famous, or infamous, former pupils—namely, the Solicitor-General for Scotland. He wrote in his Who's Who entry of being educated at Edinburgh University and Fettes— educated in spite of both.<br><br>
The hon Member for South, Angus (Mr. Fraser) should be rising to defend his old school—but I shall listen to the hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman explain why his right hon Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) has removed the source of his education from Who's Who?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been very lenient in my rulings, but I think that if the hon Gentleman replied to that, it would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: understand that the children of my right hon Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) attend a comprehensive school. At least he is moving in the right direction, which is more than I can say about some Conservative Members.<br><br>
It is quite clear that some education authorities are wary that if the assisted places scheme is implemented to any great extent, there may be a creaming-off effect from the education authority schools. It is probable that the type of pupil who may benefit from such a scheme—participate, if not benefit—will tend to be the brighter pupil. I wonder whether the Minister will allay the suspicions of education authorities and teachers about this matter. Is it his intention to see that there is a spread of ability among the pupils who will benefit from the assisted places scheme, or will these schools be allowed to continue the rather ruthless form of selection which some independent schools operate at present?<br><br>
In any event, I think that it would be only right and just for the education authorities to be consulted. If the Minister were to confine the assisted places scheme to the areas where the local education authority wanted the scheme, I guess that it would hardly get off the ground. The educational committee on the Lothian Region council has expressed opposition. Strathclyde education authority, the Central education authority, and Fife education authority have expressed opposition. I do not know about the Western Isles or Orkney and Shetland, but I imagine that they would not want anything to do with the scheme.<br><br>
In other words, the vast majority of education authorities in Scotland have expressed opposition. If we take into account the fact that Strathclyde authority represents about half the parents and schoolchildren in Scotland, it is clear that the elected representatives of the vast majority of parents in Scotland want nothing to do with this shabby, ill-thought-out scheme. It is a scheme without friends.<br><br>
As it has no friends at education authority level, let us look at what the teachers have to say about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
scheme. They are far more experienced in education than the Minister, and they have no enthusiasm for the scheme. Amendment No. 129 would require the approval of the teaching profession, through the General Teaching Council and also through the bona fide teachers' trade unions which are recognised for negotiating purposes.<br><br>
The Educational Institute of Scotland, of which I am a member, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the Government to discriminate in this way in favour of the private sector at a time when it is cutting the public education service to the bone is indefensible and, indeed, immoral, and the fact that it is being done in order to requite supporters of the Conservative Party in pursuance of an election pledge does not excuse it."</p></blockquote>
That institute is the largest teachers' trade union, but it is interesting to see that it is not alone on this matter. There are often divisions of opinion among teaching unions in Scotland, but on this issue, there seems to be a degree of unanimity in opposition to the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
I have here comments from the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association. I understand that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is one of its advisers— an unpaid hack. I shall be interested to see how he votes on the amendment, because I do not see any schools in his constituency listed in the provisional list of assisted places schools. I notice that the teachers' trade union of which he was a member and with which he still has connections is also strongly opposed to the scheme. The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have already made known our opposition to the introduction of a Scottish assisted places scheme. … Our main
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
objection to the scheme is that it appears to be based on the faulty premise that a better education is provided in secondary grant-aided or independent schools than is provided in State secondary schools."</p></blockquote>
That claim by the Government—which seems to be the basic assumption behind the scheme—is a vast insult to the majority of teachers who are employed in local education authority schools. The scheme insults not only parents and pupils but also the teaching profession. The thinking behind it seems to be that local education authority schools and their teachers are somehow incapable of bringing the best out of children, particularly bright children, in the upper school. That is why it does not surprise me that the scheme has very few, if any, friends. I do not know of a single organisation which commands respect in Scottish education circles which is in favour of the scheme.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will decide, even at this late date, to ditch the scheme completely and to use the £3| million, and the further money which would no doubt be allocated in future years if the scheme ever got off the ground, for higher priorities. He should use it for disadvantaged children, for the children with special educational needs, and within the public sector instead of using it to line the pockets of the privileged few.</span></p>
