	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 258, in page 56, line 14, leave out sub-paragraph (b)and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Each side, in turn, shall nominate a chairman from among the members of the committee to serve for 12 months from his nomination."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 171, in page 56, line 14, leave out sub-paragraph (b).</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, the salaries negotiating committee has an independent chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I gather that the chairman seldom attends the meetings of the Committee and seldom chairs them, that most of the time the chair is taken by one of the members and that he never chairs a sub-committee. I see that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who has sat on the committee, agrees that that is the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is one decision that the chairman has to make—not every year, but occasionally. He has to decide when the negotiations have broken down and when, at the request of one side only, the problem should be referred to arbitration. I am concerned about the effect in those circumstances of the change in the legislation from an independent chairman to a chairman taken from one or other of the sides. I am afraid that such a chairman might find himself in difficulties if the reference was made at the request of the other side and the side of which the chairman is a member was not happy about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is a probing amendment. I hope that my hon Friend the Under-Secretary of State will explain the reasoning behind the decision to remove the independent chairman, especially in the light of the fact that he does not chair most of the meetings. Why should the independent chairman be removed completely, when from time to time there is a difficult job to do which may be better done by a chairman who is independent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my ambitions and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>842</span>
those of my hon Friends are, quite as modest as those of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). We will probably wish to vote on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We criticise the way in which the Secretary of State is accruing powers, which is illustrated by this change. We would be happier with an arrangement whereby there was an independent chairman and two vice-chairman taken from among the members of committee, representing local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the range of amendments included in the group would probably tax even the permutating capabilities of my hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), who in an earlier debate showed us the range of options that were open for sittings. Here we have every option, from an independent chairman to annual alternates or an independent chairman plus two vice-chairmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has given rise to expressions of anxiety across the board about the chairmanship of the committee. We recognise that the chairman has only a limited role, but unfortunately that limited role assumes great significance at times of crisis when discussions break down. We wish to ensure that at such times the chairman would be independent. We must take account, too, of the fact that there are responsibilities to be fulfilled in between crises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment specifies an independent chairman and two vice-chairmen who would be able to deal with the committee's tasks in relation to salaries and conditions. The teachers' union backs that view, feeling that that would be the most even-handed way of dealing with the matter. Indeed, the EIS made representations to us and we framed the amendment round its words. We should be interested to hear the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may press our amendment to a vote, but in view of the arithmetic of the Committee that may be rather an empty gesture. Perhaps, too, the Minister may wish to reflect on his intentions towards the Committee and consider what has been said by hon Members both on his side and from the Opposition. Opposition hon Members all feel that the chairman must have the independence that would allow him to enjoy the confidence of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relations between the local authorities and the teachers' side are normally good. However, because of expenditure cuts, resulting in teacher redundancies becoming commonplace, many of us expect that those relations will be soured. We hope that the establishment of the principle of an independent chairman would be a means of coping with the distrust and anxiety that may well develop on both sides as the education crisis in Scotland deepens. That is bound to happen when the education service is starved of resources and subjected to considerable cutbacks in staffing, resulting in teacher unemployment and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If things get worse it will be even more desirable to have an independent chairman, with two vice-chairmen, one from each side, who will be able to deal with the other business of the committee over the course of the year. The role of the independent chairman, like the chairman's role in the past, will be restricted to activity in crises, when talks break down and there is a clear failure to agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess to a certain amount of difficulty, as there are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>843</span>
two Opposition amendments. One is under my name, which I am glad to say does not now appear over the other, too. I confess that, as is clear from my amendment, I have reservations about the concept of an independent chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay)—and, I presume, the amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill)—means that the independent chairman would be appointed by the Secretary of State. My hon Friend's amendment does not state that, but that seems inherent in what it proposes. However, as the Secretary of State is already a full member of the committee I do not see how he can appoint an independent chairman. It means that one part of one side of the negotiating machinery is appointing the so called independent chairman. I do not see how that makes him independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better for each side in turn to nominate the chairman, so that there was a change round each year, though not necessarily a change round in the chairmanship. That may happen. It may mean that each side will nominate a chairman for that year and next year the other side will nominate a different chairman. But certainly within the negotiating committee on which I served, James Scotland, the principal of Aberdeen College of Education, was the chairman for the whole of the period in which I served. So far as I know, he is still the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because Mr. Scotland has been considered to be a suitable chairman—though on occasions I have reservations about him—each side in turn has renominated him each year. My amendment states clearly that it does not have to be a chairman from the side which is nominated. It says that it shall be a member of the committee. That allows each side to have a chairmanship, which permits a certain amount of give and take. It allows for a slightly better arrangement than the concept of an independent chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the hon Member for Argyll and my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire whether they can give me an idea who this person is likely to be, and from where we shall get this so-called expert. Will he be a person who has experience in negotiating machineries elsewhere? If he has experience, on what side does he serve? That would make a difference to his independence. If he were to be someone as my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was, on the management side throughout his independence the staff would be in doubt, whereas if he were someone from the staff with experience of negotiating from the trade union point of view, the management might have some disagreements about his independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not to be somebody who has experience working within negotiating machineries, I have some doubt as to the value of his role as an independent chairman. It is difficult for someone without that experience to be able to judge whether an issue should go to arbitration, which would probably be a major role that an independent, or any, chairman would have to play. He would have to make a decision whether negotiations had broken down, and, if they had whether the issue should go to arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>844</span>
That can be a very involved and complicated matter. On the major salaries issue it is not, but on some of the major issues which the committee would be debating it would be an issue of some importance. If the chairman did not have the experience, he would be in some difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the view expressed by my hon Friend] apologise for not hearing the hon Member for Argyll. It must have been an extremely brief speech, because I was not that late into Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the chairman has to be part of the committee. He has to be someone who is involved in the process from beginning to end, not someone who is standing back from it. Therefore, I prefer my own amendment. In the circumstances, it may be difficult to force it through to a vote, but I hope that my hon Friend will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is in difficulty, he is not in half the difficulty that I am in, because my name is attached to amendment No. 265, and I do not agree with it, but I agree with amendment No. 258. How I got myself into that kind of fankle, I can only leave members of the Committee to work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) argues from the current situation. While that is interesting and to some extent relevant, it is not what we are talking about in terms of amendments. We are talking about the new negotiating body. We can learn from experience of the existing negotiating body, but the new system is somewhat different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the present arrangement—I think that the hon Member for Argyll conceded this in what was almost a give-away speech to the Minister—the independent chairman and vice-chairman come in only occasionally. In my day—unless there have been any changes—the independent chairman was Lord Robertson, judge of the court of session, and his vice-chairman was Mr. J. J. Clyde. That raises the issue: "It all depends what you mean by independent". They were certainly not members of either side of the argument—neither was a teacher nor a member of a local authority—but I do not think that they were totally independent on every issue. However, that is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon Friend would agree that on the issue of independent and grant-aided schools, where the majority of judges, lawyers, and so on, were educated, they could hardly be regarded as in any way independent. I should think that they would have to declare an interest before accepting chairmanships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That strikes a familiar chord with me, but I do not think that I should go down that interesting but irrelevant—in the current context—alley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the place for an independent chairman under the proposals. I cannot see what part he will play in the negotiations, the reference to arbitration, or the Secretary of State's powers to overrule the arbitration— although if an independent chairman had the power to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>845</span>
say that the Secretary of State could not overrule the arbitration, that might be a real power. I cannot see at what point in the procedure the chairman comes in. If he does, it is merely in a formal role, and I do not see what use that would serve. To take the hon Member for Argyll's point about the present negotiations, they are very much of a formality and would be even more so under the proposed arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost all of the work on salaries is now done in the negotiating sub-committee. That has normally been chaired by the chairman of the management side, but on occasions, in his absence, it has been chaired by the chairman of the teachers' side. It has worked very well. Of course there are two sides, and although, technically, the chairman of the management side is in the chair, he acts as spokesman for the management. The chairman of the teachers' side acts, from the floor, as spokesman for the teachers. There is to-ing and fro-ing as occasionally other members come in, but it is very much a negotiating arrangement. I do not know of any instances of contention about the chairman of the management side taking the chair in a formal sense. Obviously, he does not go out of his way to alienate the teachers in the conduct of the meeting, which is what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the suggestion of my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart is sensible, but it can be achieved as the Bill stands. So I find myself once more in the somewhat embarrassing position of agreeing with the Minister's proposal—or what I assume he will say. It seems logical and sensible, and I do not see why we should oppose proposals for the sake of opposition if they seem reasonable. I assume that what the Under-Secretary is to say about this will be reasonable, for once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said that under the Bill as drafted it would be for the committee to choose its own chairman from among its members. That seems to me a reasonable proposition. It has been anomalous to have an independent chairman, like a deus ex machina, to solve a problem which the committee has not been able to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the professional associations wish to have an independent chairman, but on occasion the professional associations have made howls of protest when the independent chairman used his right to send a wages claim out for arbitration when they felt the matter should have been negotiated further within the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is a matter about which the Committee should get over-excited. Either the Government's formula or the more specific formula in amendment No. 258 would be suitable. The existing method has worked well, but not so well that it should be used 	<i>ad infinitum.</i> I shall support amendment No. 258 against the proposition of an independent chairman in amendment No. 170 if there is a vote on amendment No. 170.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 258, which the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) supports, does not conflict with the intention of paragraph 1 of schedule 5, that the committee may appoint a chairman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>846</span>
from among its members. There is therefore no need to press the amendment, because its purpose is satisfied by the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot reconcile the points of view expressed by Opposition Members. I appreciate the comments made by the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He is not afraid to say that he agrees with the schedule as it is framed. There are no great party points at stake, because these are matters of organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish the involvement of the Secretary of State in the new committees to be minimised. We therefore feel that the important question of the chairing of the committee can be left to members of the committee. Of the five negotiating committees which would be replaced by the five committees in the Bill, only the Scottish Teachers Salaries Committee has a chairman who is not appointed from within the membership of the committee. Even within the STSC, most of the negotiations have been conducted in a negotiating sub-committee—a point which was referred to by the hon Member for South Ayrshire—without the presence of the independent chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the argument that an independent chairman is necessary when it has to be decided whether negotiations have broken down and an issue should be referred to arbitration. This point has arisen in the past and has been settled without difficulty by chairmen drawn from within negotiating committees. It would therefore seem, both on principle and in the light of the experience of existing committees, that we can rely on the membership of the committee to appoint a chairman and conduct business responsibly following that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is too bland when he says that my amendment is unnecessary because that is what the committee will do anyway. With respect, that is not what the schedule says. It says in paragraph 	<i>1(b)</i> that the committee shall:
	<br><blockquote><p>" appoint a chairman from among its own members and revoke the appointment of his predecessor, if any."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3 makes it clear that where a committee votes on a motion, there must be a majority on both sides before it can be passed. That means that once a committee has appointed a chairman—let us say, for example, that a management side chairman has been chosen in the first instance—the majority of the management side have to be in agreement to overthrow him before he can be overthrown, whereas amendment No. 258 suggests that the chairmanship should change annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might look at this matter a little more carefully. Although the Government's intention may be that what I am suggesting will take place, would not it be better to write it in in the way that I have suggested? It is not a major change. As the hon Gentleman said himself, it is not a party political point. It would be better if it were built into the Bill itself, which would make the situation clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, the amendment does not conflict with the spirit, the intention, of the schedule. However, we think that it is unnecessary and undesirable to specify how the comittee should exercise its function, as the hon Gentleman would like us to do. It is normal for the chairman to be appointed alternately be each side of the committee for an agreed period.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>847</span>
However, the statute should not legislate on such details of the committee's procedure. We do not believe that it is necessary for us, in approving the committee and providing the schedule about the committee, to introduce into it the kind of detail that the hon Gentleman proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the short debate with interest. I think that it was worth having, because we are debating a change which could have significant consequences. The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) has been particularly valuable in being able to give information about his experience on the management side, as has the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in being able to give details of experience on another committee which had a chairman drawn from its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still have a nagging doubt that one day we may wish we had not done what is proposed. However, I am reasonably satisfied with what I have heard, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 56, line 37, after "3", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Except in the exercise of any function relating to the resolution of a dispute between a teacher and his employer".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This is rather a technical amendment—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the hon Gentleman does not understand it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to know that the hon Member uses those words when he does not understand his own amendments. He has used them quite a lot in the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the schedule stands, it would require a majority of both sides to be in favour of a motion of the committee, or of any of its sub-committees, before that motion could be accepted. I think that that condition is unnecessarily restrictive on the committee, which is now more than a salaries committee—I think that that is the important point. It will consider other matters, which will sometimes involve conflict or dispute between individual teachers and their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, it is not reasonable to put in the qualifications about the majority that are written into the schedule. My amendment provides simply that when the committee deals with matters that relate to a dispute between an individual teacher and his employer, the majority rules in the schedule should be waived, because they are written for the salaries negotiation part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Under-Secretary will perhaps be able to tell me whether the conditions of service committee uses these kinds of majorities. If not, when we are amalgamating them, I should have thought that it would be best if we did not require the majority on both sides. If it is kept the way it is, it could become difficult for those disputes to be resolved amicably— or even to be resolved at all. My hon Friend might consider adding the words that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>848</span>
There is, however, the problem that there will be some disputes between a teacher and an employer that are concerned with salaries. A teacher may believe that the employer has put him in the wrong band, or at the wrong point in the scale. Such a dispute could have implications for other teachers. I accept the hon Gentleman's point about conditions of service, but I have some reservations about the amendment as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon Gentleman's point, although I wonder whether a dispute about salary positioning between a teacher and his employer would very often, or ever, be used as a precedent for a number of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A dispute about the positioning of a whole group of teachers on the salaries scale would have to be resolved between the union side and the employers' side at a salaries negotiation. That is what happens at the moment, and very often one of the outcomes of salary negotiations is to shift a group of people from one position on the scale to another. A matter of principle involving more than just one teacher will probably be dealt with as a salaries negotiation and therefore the majority on both sides will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the point about the individual teacher is still valid, and I urge my hon Friend to accept the amendment or to rephrase it so that ordinary disputes between a teacher and his employer coming before the committee—the new committee—for resolution will not need the double-sided majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that amendment No. 172 emanates from the brief prepared by the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association. If the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) had had time to read the brief again this morning, he would probably have noticed that at present there is no requirement for a majority on both sides in disputes about conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the committee is an amalgam of two committees and that it is difficult to devise standing orders under which in some circumstances a certain majority is not required but in other circumstances it is required. Drafting the standing orders could be a confusing business. But I would be interested to hear from the Under-Secretary whether it would be possible for the committee, under its own standing orders, to determine how a majority should be arrived at in areas not related to salaries. II the Minister says that that would be possible, the probing amendment will have been successful in eliciting the information that the SSTA rightly seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be technically possible, in framing the standing orders, to arrange for a get-out such as the SSTA and the hon Member for Argyll are seeking? Where conditions are concerned, the battle lines need not be drawn up as rigidly as they have to be in wage negotiations. The arrangements can be a little more flexible. If the Minister cannot give us an answer today, we could consider the matter again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3 enacts the voting procedure that already applies in the Scottish teachers salaries committee and its sub-committees. I appreciate, however, that in the existing Scottish

teachers service conditions committee, to which my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) referred, which is a non-statutory body, a different procedure is adopted in resolving disputes between teachers and their employers. In those cases the decision is taken on a majority vote of those present, whether they represent teachers or management, although I understand that major decisions made in the conditions of service committee also proceed on a majority vote. I should not wish the committee to be unduly restricted in the way in which it organises its voting procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point made by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). It might be possible in standing orders to give the committee the sort of flexibility that he and, I think, my hon Friend would wish to achieve. I accept my hon Friend's point in principle. We should like to consider it further and return on Report, perhaps with an appropriate amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Minister's intention, if he cannot resolve the problem in the way that he suggested, that individual cases will be part of the arbitration procedure? If there is not to be a system such as the one suggested by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), there must be some way for individual cases to go to arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our intention to try to resolve the matter along the lines of my hon Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what my hon Friend has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 57, line 29, leave out "other than" and insert "including".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it has been noticed that I have got through to my third amendment in 35 minutes. If the Opposition had taken a leaf out of my book, we might have proceeded much quicker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before anyone else says it, I shall mention that this amendment also comes to me as a suggestion from the SSTA. We have been over this ground before, and I do not think that we succeeded in persuading my hon Friend about it. But the Secretary of State does have a part to play in the negotiating procedures. He also has a part to play in the other areas of the committee's work—conditions of service, and so on. It seems unfair that he, of all parties involved in the new committee, should be excluded from making any financial contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I remember rightly, my hon Friend said that the Secretary of State had powers to make payments if necessary for special projects, such as Munn and Dunning, although I cannot see why they should be necessary in this case. But if extra work has to be done as a result of a Green Paper or White Paper from the Scottish Office, I hope that any expense will be borne in part by the Secretary of State—if the extra work comes from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>850</span>
The Bill puts the whole burden of the cost of the new committee on the employers' side and the teachers' side. My hon Friend might consider this small amendment to include the Secretary of State in the bodies from which money might have to be recovered in the event of income not covering expenditure. Of course, if the committee budgets properly, that should not happen. But if it does—perhaps because of something introduced by the Secretary of State—it is only right that the Secretary of State should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is essentially the same as amendment No. 259. Although the wording may be different, the result would be exactly the same—that the Secretary of State would pay his share of the cost of the Committee. I think that at present he covers the total costs of three of the five committees to be amalgamated into the two committees. Therefore, he should maintain at least some contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State cannot say "I shall be a full member of the committee on the management side, but I shall not meet any of the costs. They will be met by others." That is not justifiable. I hope that the Minister will take notice of what his hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ventilated this argument earlier, but it must now be reiterated. It is ridiculous that the trade union side should be expected to meet some of the costs of the negotiations. That would never happen in private industry, and it does not happen in other local government negotiations. The National Joint Council officials have told us that trade unions are not expected to contribute to the funding of that body. To try to raise money by flogging leaflets seems an absurd way of funding an important body. It is irresponsible of the Government to seek to deny that body funds, especially since, as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, extra work may well be necessitated because of Government decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) will as usual chicken out of putting his amendment to the vote. I imagine that the pugilistic Whip will, as usual, threaten the hon Gentleman, and that his party will create problems about his pressing the amendment. The most appropriate course may be for us to reconsider the matter and debate it again on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My impression is that the provision has slipped the attention of COSLA and the local authority side in general. I expect that they are becoming aware of what is happening and that representations will now be made to the Minister. Has the matter been the subject of consultations with local authorities and the National Joint Council? If so, have those bodies shown any approval? From my own somewhat limited discussions, I have the impression that they are not happy with the added imposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister means to insist on the provision, will he take account of those costs when drawing up the rate support grant? Can he envisage the unions refusing to contribute? If that happened, what would be the result of the consequent lack of funds? What would happen to the wages of those employed by the secretariat of the salaries negotiating body? The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>851</span>
Minister will have to take account of that possibility. Trade unions disappointed with the handling or the outcome of negotiations could seek, as a sanction, to withdraw from funding the body, which could cause much embarrassment. I therefore hope that the Minister will go back and consult the unions, the management and the secretariat which now services at least some of the committees—certainly the major committees that deal with schoolteachers' salaries and thus account for the biggest single group of employees in the sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have referred on numerous occasions to the consultations that took place on the Bill. Those consultations, especially those with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, provided an opportunity for such matters to be raised. However, the matter in question has never been raised with me by any of the bodies concerned. Furthermore, the standing orders of the STSC already provide for contributions by the teachers' associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that although the Secretary of State will be represented on the management side of the Committee, he is not an employer, and we do not consider that it is necessary or appropriate that he should contribute to the employer's share of the expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is probably some misunderstanding about the new procedures. In practice, the Secretary of State duplicates the work done by the Scottish teachers' salaries committee by notifying settlements reached in the committee, and the Bill's proposal will create no significant additional work or expense for negotiating bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, there was a duplication of effort once a settlement had been reached. We believe now that it is in the best interest of all concerned to cut out the duplication. The committee will, as now, notify its findings, which were previously promulgated by the Secretary of State. Therefore, there will be no expenditure increase as a result of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon Friend, but I am not sure that I am happy about the matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main change will be that the duplication of notifying settlements will not take place as it does under existing procedures. The STSC will continue the practice that it has in the past, and that will be the only notification. No additional expense will be borne by the committee as a result of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will the savings be? What is the cost of duplication at present?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are differences in tertiary matters where the Secretary of State is operating as an employer, so he contributes to the expense involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 5 agreed to.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question Proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my somewhat sudden and dramatic elevation to membership of the Committee, due to the unfortunate illness of my hon Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) I renewed my investigations into the provisions of the Bill. While reminding myself about various provisions, such as the assisted places scheme and the salaries and conditions of service negotiating committees, I had to look from the beginning at the question of educational endowments. The education and social services section of the Library research division informed me that:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Clause 15 and schedule 6 of the Bill on educational endowments seem to have aroused very little interest."</p></blockquote>
They may have aroused very little interest for a number of reasons: first, that it is so complicated; secondly, that the Government have gone out of their way not to arouse any great interest in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only information on this small clause and its large schedule is in the notes on clauses. In that expensive blue-covered document we find this miracle of explanation:
	<br><blockquote><p>" This clause simply gives effect to Schedule 6, which contains amendments to Part VI of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 (Reorganisation of Endowments) and to section 77 of that Act (Grant-aided Colleges)."</p></blockquote>
That is not the greatest explanation of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The note on schedule 6, "Educational endowments," gives a careful explanation of what the paragraphs mean, but little information on what is behind the proposals. I have asked on a number of occasions, but have received little information about what is behind many of the proposals, although we are often given an explanation and reiteration of what is contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that the consultative paper was produced in March 1980, and then, following consultation—for which the Government are now renowned, if not famous—a written answer was given on 28 October
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>853</span>
1980, when the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) showed a sudden and unexpected interest in educational endowments. I wonder what stirred his interest. Perhaps it was a little nudge and a wink. He asked the Secretary of State for Scotland:
	<br><blockquote><p>" what conclusions he has reached with regard to the future arrangements for reorganising educational endowments in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Having carefully considered the responses to the consultative paper."</p></blockquote>
Will the Under-Secretary of State tell us what was the level of response to the consultative paper? How many organisations replied? Which organisations replied? What was the level of interest shown in the consultative paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>" I propose that education authorities should, subject to certain safeguards, be given powers to reorganise educational endowments in their areas, other than those governing independent schools."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 28 October 1980; Vol. 991, 	<i>c.</i> 228-29.]</p></blockquote>
How many of the representations stated that this was what those concerned wanted to happen? How many of the local authorities that replied, or COSLA—if it replied, and I should be interested to know whether it did—stated that they would like local authorities to take over this responsibility? If so, did they say whether they wanted it to be a statutory responsibility, or did they just want powers to do this? Did they say, as I imagine they might have done, that, if it were to be a statutory requirement, educational endowments should be taken account of in the allocation of additional resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary of State estimate how much is involved in educational endowments in Scotland? First, what is the capital value of the educational endowments? Secondly, what is their income? Of that revenue income, how much is applied each year? How much is sought? How much is allocated to applicants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon Gentleman, but if we go too wide on this clause, it could pre-empt a debate on schedule 6 being the sixth schedule to the Bill. The clause merely enables the schedule to become operative. Perhaps we should pass the clause in a formal way and have the general discussion on the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind, Mr. Gourlay, but if I say what I have to say now, I shall certainly not repeat it, or even speak again, on schedule 6. I just thought that it was logical to deal with the matter now, because if we pass clause 15 it will make schedule 6 operative. But it is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. However, while I am in the middle of my speech, perhaps I could continue, with your permission, Mr. Gourlay. I shall not go on unnecessarily long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asking what was the capital amount, what was the revenue amount, and how much of that revenue income was applied each year to bona fide applicants. I also wish for clarification on the register which the Secretary of State keeps. One person a day consults it, and there are 10 telephone calls a week. I wonder what publicity is given to it, because increasingly many people would not be eligible for student awards who might not know about the register. Perhaps the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>854</span>
could explain whether the register is made available to all applicants for student awards, especially if unsuccessful, and whether there are posters and regular advertisements about the register's availability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ALBERT MCQUARRIE 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>As it is proposed to give responsibility to local authorities, how many of the trusts will be local and how many national? Local authorities would be able to deal competently—if they had the resources and the desire—with local or regional trusts, but would have great difficulty in dealing with national trusts.</p>
	<p>The proposals are designed, as are many of the Government's proposals, to save staff. I wonder how many staff in the Scottish Office are involved, what the savings will be, and whether those staff will be made redundant or transferred. Obviously the register will be maintained, so inquiries will still have to be dealt with, but will legal staff involved in the transfer or reorganisation of trusts be made redundant, or will they—as Conservative Members, critical of the Government, implied in yesterday's Finance Bill debate— just be transferred to other jobs?</p>
	<p>I am concerned about what is proposed. Having recently looked into the question of charities and trusts for another purpose, I note that one of the shining lights in the whole range of charities and trusts in Scotland is the educational endowment. Literally millions of pounds are locked up in charities and trusts in Scotland which are not being applied for the purpose for which they should be. Some of the money cannot be applied. I say that with no disrespect to the solicitors, many of whom are looking for applications. But they cannot find people of the name of McTavish who were born in Auchtermuchtie, or whatever the qualification is. They want to change the purpose of the trusts, but they cannot. However, educational endowments are the one area in which there has been power to change the purpose of, and reorganise, trusts and give them a modern application, even to help people in rural areas with difficulty over transport—perhaps to provide minibuses.</p>
	<p>What worries me is that when the Secretary of State gives up his power to reorganise trusts and make them more applicable to modern circumstances, and hands it over to local authorities, it will not be as a statutory requirement, because he says that local authorities will not have the resources. We have often argued with the Under-Secretary that more resources should be made available to local authorities for a whole range of purposes—but that is a separate argument. But now that the power is to be handed over to local authorities without a statutory requirement, I fear that, like other trusts and charities, the educational endowments will become more and more out of date and that less and less of the money—which the consultative paper calls private money for public purposes—will be applied to purposes such as those that it was originally intended to benefit.</p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>I am grateful to you, Mr. McQuarrie, and to your predecessor, for allowing me to make those points. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to answer them, because his discussion is not merely academic—it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>855</span>
is real. When millions of pounds that could be applied to useful educational purposes are tied up and unused, it is right that the Government and the local authorities should not only be able to modernise the trusts and foundations but should be required to do so. I would be very disturbed if the passage of the Bill rendered such modernisation less likely to take place.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for raising those points, and I am also grateful to your fellow chairman, Mr. McQuarrie, for deciding that his clause stand part debate should cover the schedule too. As he pointed out, the effect of clause 15 is to bring into operation the provisions of schedule 6, and that is all one can say about it. The schedule itself goes into detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions have no purpose other than the general purpose contained in other parts of the Bill and notably in clause 6. They would give effect to the Secretary of State's decision to withdraw from most of his present functions relating to educational endowments, and to transfer his powers of reorganisation of endowments either to education authorities or to the court of session, depending on the type of endowment involved. That is in line with the Government's general policy of allowing local authorities and other bodies to conduct matters that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, they should be capable of managing as part of their general day-to-day duties. These are matters, in our opinion, that should not require the attention of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were, of course, consultations with the governing bodies of the various endowment schemes, COSLA, the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society. I think that about 120 bodies in all, including COSLA, were consulted, and about 38 responded, including COSLA, but mostly the governing bodies of various schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital value of the schemes to which the hon Gentleman refers is about £25 million and the income is in excess of £2½ million, most of which is applied to endowment purposes. The main publicity given to the register, as I am sure the hon Gentleman will be aware, is that it is brought to the attention of students who fail to obtain an award in the normal way. Hon Members will know that when they write to me about matters of this kind I invariably in my reply give them the addresses of two or three bodies that might be helpful to their constituents if, for whatever reason, they have failed to qualify for students' awards in the normal way. The awards branch itself advises students of this facility, if they fail to receive an award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 1,000 trusts would come under the local authorities. Many of them are small, but the overall number is larger. Our proposals would bring about 300 under the court of session. About five full-time staff in the Scottish Office are involved, so the saving of Government expenditure could be about £70,000 per annum. Of course, the staff would be redeployed to posts elsewhere in the Scottish Office; there would be no redundancies. That deals with the detailed questions that have been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the provision is to reduce the administrative burden on the Secretary of State and to allow such matters to be dealt with speedily and efficiently by local authorities or by the court of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
session. In deciding whether to take the step we considered a number of factors, including the costs of going to the court of session. People are often inhibited by legal fees and other legal costs. We took advice and satisfied ourselves that the change in the arrangements would not put governing bodies to any undue expense with regard to the endowments. I therefore commend the clause, and, in due course, schedule 6, to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the Minister's reply to my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). My Friend listed several detailed questions that have not been answered. The Minister said that the key to the matter was the transfer of an administrative burden and its associated costs from the Secretary of State. However, that will create difficulties for the authorities to which the burden is transferred. They have not enough funds at their disposal now, and are scarcely likely to welcome any increase in either their administrative burdens or their costs. The Minister has not explained how the change will affect appellants. He mentioned that if anyone comes to us now with a difficulty we can write to him for advice on the schemes available. I wonder what I should do if anyone came to me in the future with a similar difficulty. The Scottish Office would no longer deal with the matter. To whom should I write? Who would keep the register and be able to tell me which funds were available? That is another difficulty caused by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has now washed his hands of carrying out any reorganisation of the funds, despite the fact that £25 million is lying about in them. That is a considerable sum. Who will take on the responsibility of carrying out the reorganisation? I do not expect that local authorities will bind themselves into an association to do that. If each authority attemps to reorganise its own funds—even supposing that the will to do so is there—how will a national register be compiled for people seeking to take advantage of funds wherever they exist? The Secretary of State has simply washed his hands of a problem. The problem is costly, so he has once again embarked on mock devolution and decided to hand the job over to local authorities. That is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more explanation. For instance, the Minister did not specify the present cost. He did not reveal how many staff were involved nor how many are likely to be involved in the future. He did not answer the questions about the future availability of the register and who is to reorganise the funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I repeat an unanswered question? The Under-Secretary kindly said that COSLA was consulted. I asked what was its response to the proposal that local authorities should take over the responsibility. Like my hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) I am worried about them taking it on, not because they do not have the good will—far from it—but because, among the plethora of other matters with which they have to deal, it will be a low priority when it is not a statutory responsibility. I can understand that it will not get done. I suspect that COSLA
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
might have expressed some reservations, particularly about the extra resources that would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished by the extent of the funds. I had assumed that they would be quite large, but not as large as £25 million. That is a substantial sum. I still have some misgivings, and I shall seek the advice of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). The Secretary of State says in his consultative document that the most significant of his endowment functions was that of reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether we should go along with this proposal, because this is a responsibility which the Government are abandoning. I appreciate the other proposals, but I do not agree that they should abandon the main responsibility. I have discussed with lawyers recently the question of charities generally, and I have spoken to the President of the Law Society about this subject. It shows how far I go in the interests of this issue. The president said that he would like this power extended, not just to educational endowments, but over a wider range of charities so that they could be reorganised. The more I think about the matter, the more worried I am about the Secretary of State giving up this responsibility. I know that he has a general policy about devolution, but this provision has worrying aspects, given the present restrictions on local authority finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) for raising this matter. It is a difficult problem about how best to unravel the knots which seem to tie up the trusts and prevent people from gaining access to them. It would be easier and better for Scottish education if there were a more satisfactory means of channelling the funds to more people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend was generous towards the Minister when he spoke in terms of devolution. Once again, this is the abdication of responsibility by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can appreciate why the Government have made this proposal, considering their philosophy of endeavouring to cut public expenditure at every turn. But to do so for savings of £70,000 which will prejudice, or perhaps jeopardise, the rights of individuals to have access to funds which have been made available by benefactors many years ago is grossly irresponsible. I foresee difficulties arising when the position of our education service becomes increasingly critical, and it will become even more important that people have access to such support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us believe that such charitable endowments are a hang-over from a bygone age, when philanthropy was the only means of assisting people. It is in many respects a form of conscience-salving. I had a history teacher who used to refer to it as an insurance policy. He said that it correlated with medieval barons building churches in order to get to heaven. The nineteenth-century capitalists, in order to assuage their consciences for their exploitation of workers, sought to introduce endowment schemes and act as benefactors. What they failed to do for their workers they sought to do for the rest of humanity. It is not for us at this stage to question their motives, which are lost in the mists of history. We are concerned that any such money that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>858</span>
available should be accessible to as many as possible. The effect of the clause would be to restrict availability and accessibility. That is regrettable and, if I interpret the views of Opposition Members correctly, we shall vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main problems for Opposition Members was the Minister's introduction to the schedule. He said that it was linked to clause 6, by which the Secretary of State was withdrawing from most of his functions, and it was linked to the general strategy of the Government which is to hand back, where appropriate, as much power as possible to local bodies and local authorities. Yet many Opposition Members, including the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who sat on the Committee on the miscellaneous provisions Bill know that the strategy of the Government is further to restrict the ability of local authorities and local bodies. The Minister's introduction to the clause poses great problems for us on both the clause and the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. If the Minister abdicates his responsibilities in this area and passes the buck to local authorities, it must be asked whether local authorities have the resources to make information available or to seek the application of the funds from the trusts, to make them available to those in greatest need. The Minister should reconsider this. I appreciate that it is chiselled into the tablets of stone of Government policy on public expenditure, but the Opposition are against the whole philosophy and the attempt to abdicate responsibility on the grounds that it will save money at some stage, because we recognise that the savings to be made are as nothing compared with the difficulties which may be caused to students and educationalists who seek access to these funds to further their own studies or improve the education service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that my hon Friends will join me in opposing the clause stand part vote. I am grateful, Mr. Gourlay, for the flexible way in which you have allowed us to range widely over this matter. The Opposition will be happy to wait until the clause stand part vote to register its disapproval of what we consider to be yet another mean and petty attempt by the Government to reduce public expenditure at the expense of private citizens who will find it more difficult to gain access to the funds which have been made available by benefactors, for whatever reason, and which are their entitlement as citizens of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points arise from the debate. First, I am not surprised at Opposition Members' attitude to charity. The Socialist state of mind does not have any time for charity. We see this all over the world. The only assistance that is given by Socialist countries is to send more weapons to groups that want to overthrow a regime in the remote corners of Africa or elsewhere. No food convoys go from Russia for famine relief in Africa or elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a subject which you would wish me to prolong, Mr. Gourlay. The clause and schedule do not in any way hamper the administration of the endowments. They should facilitate administration of the endowments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They certainly do not rob people of the funds and benefits available to them. They will facilitate change in the endowments. There are a large number of them, as I have already told	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> the hon Member for South Ayrshire. Change is needed in many of them, and direct access to the Court of the Session or to local authorities in this regard will facilitate the administration of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA welcomed the change, although it made the usual qualification about the resources, which I fully understand and which the hon Member for South Ayrshire has mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that I should have made about the register is that, to facilitate the availability of the information, it is being computerised in the Scottish Office awards branch. That means that we shall be able to keep it up to date, local authorities will advise us of changes and the information and service that we are giving to hon Members' constituents on these matters will be greatly improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once the register is on the computer, will those who want to gain access to it have to pay, or will it be freely available, for instance, in public libraries? Shall we be able to go in, use a keying-in station and find out exactly what we want to know? How will this change help the individuals who want to gain access to the information on the computer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about educational endowments. Information relating to educational endowments will be held in the computer at the awards branch, which is obviously the place to keep it, because that is where people come in the first instance if they wish to have a student award. If, for whatever reason, they are disqualified from an award, as I have already said, the computer information should be up to date and will advise them which of the educational endowments they might apply for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangement is a help because it makes the information more readily available to the staff, and we would welcome that. I know that the Minister will not give way on many things, but I wonder whether he would consider having a much more vigorous campaign to make this information, now that it will be computerised, more generally available? Many people to whom I have spoken recently have not known about its availability. It would be helpful, not just for those who have applied and been turned down, but also for those who may not apply, and who are out of touch with the awards branch because they know that they are not eligible for an award, but who might be eligible for these educational endowments. Will the Minister give at least some consideration to a more vigorous, and not too expensive, advertising and promotional exercise for these educational endowments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a function of many of these endowments to advertise themselves, which they do in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
press. I am not so sure whether it would be a correct function of a register holder to advertise its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not able to find out at the moment, but I shall look into whether these endowments are mentioned in the awards branch booklet that goes out to students. They may be—I do not know. If they are not mentioned in that booklet, I shall find out whether there is any reason why they should not be. If they can be, I shall consider making a reference in the booklet, and I shall certainly advise the hon Gentleman about what steps we can take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of funds—the £25 million—has surprised members of the Opposition. They will appreciate that that sum is not money sitting in a bank somewhere. The bulk of it is in buildings, and fixtures, so it is not loose cash. It is mainly in some kind of fixed asset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment, and if I had been a little more careful, I could probably have made it more exact. Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the determination of the content of courses of training ",</p></blockquote>
but it is only the four words "the content of courses" which concern me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there is an argument for saying that the General Teaching Council should have some say in the entry provisions and the general courses to be laid on. It should be able to say that certain subjects should be dealt with in colleges of education and that perhaps there should be a course in English, mathematics or some other subject. That may be fair enough, because the General Teaching Council is the body that advises the Secretary of State about supply and about who should teach in Scotland and who should not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if an outside organisation—an organisation on which the colleges of education are not very strongly represented—lays down the content of a course, I believe that that is a serious intervention in academic freedom. It may be that what the Bill says is not what the Minister intends. But what I understand by the phrase "the content of courses" is the detail of the knowledge that will be imparted in each course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The college in which I taught will not be there for very much longer; that is the Tories' revenge for the fact that I am now in this place. I lectured in a history course. The GTC will be able to state that a history teacher shall teach certain specific topics and that he shall teach nothing else. I accept that that is probably not the intention of the Minister or of those who drafted the clause, but that is what the clause states. The words are "the content of courses".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand how the hon Gentleman has arrived at that conclusion and I understand his argument. This provision is an attempt to rectify an error in the existing legislation. It is not an attempt to shift the power. I do not want to interrupt the hon Gentleman any further at this stage but I feel certain that when I reply to his remarks he will agree that nothing is being done other than what is necessary to put the legislation into line with the present situation in colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. That was the answer I expected him to make, but when I look at a Bill I look at the wording of it, because 1 believe that that is what people outside Parliament, quite rightly, look at. They do not read what the Minister said in Committee; they read the Act itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
Not all teachers look upon colleges of education very kindly, and teachers are in a majority on the GTC. They could interpret those words differently from the way in which the Minister intended them to be interpreted. The GTC might act in a way that the Minister would not think right, that I would not think right and that colleges of education and educationalists in general would not consider right, and the Minister would then have to come back to Parliament and change the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The content of courses should not be prescribed by the GTC. The general courses should be prescribed by the GTC and it should be left to the colleges, and the departments within the colleges, to decide what should be taught in each course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can give me some assurance that he will reconsider the wording. The words "prescribing or providing for the determination of courses of training" would make the position clear. Perhaps the Minister could consider bringing in an amendment to that effect on Report. If he can give me some indication whether or not he will be prepared to do so, I may be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried in the time available this morning to examine the discussions that took place over the 1965 Act and the 1969 Act. Unfortunately, during the Committee stage of the 1969 Act section 15 of that Act was not debated but went through on the nod. When I ask my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) what happened he could not remember much about it, although he was sure that it had been done with the best of intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties- have been expressed in the columns of newspapers such as 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement.</i> They may stem, as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) suggested, from the preoccupation that teachers often display with language. There is nothing more frustrating than to attend a teachers' meeting and find that among the 40 or 50 teachers present there are 70 or 80 different interpretations of a circular that has been issued. Wording must be made simple and clear. Be that as it may, members of staff in colleges of education have expressed anxieties about their academic freedom. It would be helpful if the Minister spelt out clearly what the relationships are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this is a complicated business. Central institutions—to use the shorthand form— funded and controlled by the Secretary of State have among their responsibilities a clear role in the training of teachers. That role has been expanded to encompass a consideration of the academic content of education— educational philosophy and the like. Central institutions therefore run courses that are not simply vocational but have other dimensions, too. Those courses provide qualifications held to be entrance qualifications for the profession. At that point the GTC comes into the game to determine the fitness or otherwise of the courses. An additional complication is that the GTC is involved not only 	<i>ex post</i> but 	<i>ex ante.</i> I see the need for a longstop provision. At the end of the day the Secretary of State is responsible. He appoints the GTC, and bodies of that nature cannot exist without a structure on which to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether I have made the matter any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
clearer. I simply appeal to the Minister to try to allay fears that I suspect are not justified. We can with justification accuse the Government of many things. However, at this stage I am not prepared to lay at their door a charge of seeking to interfere with academic freedom, although they may do that inadvertently through their economic policies. Their attempts to starve institutions of resources or to close them may be regarded as a form of limitation of academic freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seek to reintroduce a measure after an absence of 16 years, and after several opportunities— a variety of education Acts, not least that of 1980—have been ignored by Ministers. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain why he has woken up to the fact that there is a gap in the legislation and believes that it must be filled at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to embark upon an all-out attack on the provision, but the Minister must allay the fears of people in colleges of education and elsewhere in the education service that the Government seek to inhibit what has come to be regarded as the colleges' academic freedom and independence of operation—anomalous though that independence may seem in the context of the GTC's role and, ultimately, the role of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government seek merely to regularise the position that has existed for 16 years but has escaped attention, that is not unreasonable. But if the Minister seeks to take powers that could be used differently from what would have been allowed in the previous vacuum, we would oppose that. Therefore, we await with interest what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was right to introduce the amendment as a probing amendment. No one is questioning the Government's good intentions on clause 16—not even Opposition Members, as the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said—but we question the effect of this part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a strongly worded letter from a responsible and knowledgeable constituent who is concerned about the implications of this part of the clause. He says that if the clause, as drafted, is accepted:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Scottish education will be under threat from some future Government of an educationally dogmatic or ideological nature, which could import any topics it pleased into the teacher training process, to the detriment both of academic freedom and of nonpartisan education."</p></blockquote>
I want the Minister to tell us not about the Government's intentions but whether the clause gives significant new powers to a future Government of ill will. I do not point the finger at any possible members of a future Government of ill will, but the principle causes concern and I hope that the Minister will be able to allay that concern when responding to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already told the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in an intervention, I am not surprised that the Committee is concerned about the cold words in clause 16. When the Bill is enacted the words will appear in their proper context in the principal Act. That may remove some of the misgivings that have understandably been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon Member for Cathcart that I can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
understand that he may think that the Secretary of State is proposing to take back from the principals and boards of studies of colleges of education the right to determine the content of courses of training, but that is not the purpose of this part of the clause. The only purpose of clause 16(2)(b) is to make clear that the Secretary of State may confer the power of determining the content of courses of training, and he proposes to continue to confer this power upon the colleges of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter arises because under the 1967 training regulations the Secretary of State conferred upon the colleges the power to determine the content of courses of training, but there is some doubt as to his power to do so because of an amendment made by the Education (Scotland) Act 1969 to the then enabling power in section 81 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1962. Hon Members will realise that there has perhaps been some drafting or other error or misunderstanding of the interpretation of the Acts as a result of amendments that have been made. The 1969 Act repealed that section of the 1962 Act and re-enacted it in different terms, thus giving rise to these doubts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Cathcart referred to the GTC, but he will appreciate that the GTC can only do what the Secretary of State authorises it to do under regulations, and the power remains with the Secretary of State. As I have already indicated, the aim of the clause is to sort out the statute on this matter, and it is the intention of the Secretary of State—as I imagine that it would be the intention of any Secretary of State of good will—to confer on the teacher training colleges the right to decide their own training arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 261 raises an important principle. The Minister once said that I had been burning the midnight oil in order to table all my amendments to clause 14. The midnight oil was becoming rather thin and weak by the time I reached the work on this amendment, and I confess that I am not convinced about its drafting. It could have been worded better, but it was fairly late at night, after I had finished all the other amendments, and I was becoming rather tired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important in terms of what I might loosely call industrial democracy. It seems that if we are ever to move to a situation in which the power within any type of organisation could be placed within the hands of as many people as possible—although the practice rather than the principle may divide politically —this is a small part of the Bill in which we could begin to promote such democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principals of colleges and universities, who are important figures in the academic life of Scotland, should be somehow or other chosen by a much larger group. While I welcome the clause as it stands, I believe that we could go wider. We could devise a system whereby the principal is elected by all members of staff rather than by appointment by the university court. That would mean a system of balloting all staff members. There is no intention that it should be limited to academic staff. I believe that all members of staff should be involved, because the principal would take important decisions that would affect all staffs. Graduates also should be involved. Perhaps my amendment should have referred to " graduates" rather than " former students".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, this is not an entirely new idea. The chancellor of Oxford university, who is at present the right hon Harold Macmillan, is elected by all members of the teaching staff at the university and by all former graduates who have taken the MA degree as opposed to the BA degree. A former graduate cannot be on the teaching staff at Oxford university unless he has attained an MA degree at that university. Anyone from another university who lectures at Oxford has conferred upon him or her an honorary MA degree. Therefore, all members of the teaching staff at the university plus all the graduates who are taking the MA degree have the right to elect the chancellor of the oldest university in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>'Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend and I may dispute that, perhaps outside the Committee room. Certainly, it is the oldest university and it has a long-standing tradition, which I appeal to Conservative Members, who are great traditionalists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon Gentleman was intending to come to the long traditions of Scottish universities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I was only stating that there is a precedent for that type of election, and the point I intended to make was that the chancellor of Oxford university is not the administrative head of the university but its titular head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
However, that was an appeal to the traditionalists on the Conservative Benches, and my more important principle is that everybody who is to be involved in the university in some way or other should have some right to say who should be its head and who should represent that university in terms of administration and the outside public, because people look to such things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is confusing the positions of chancellor, rector and principal. If the hon Gentleman wishes to address the Committee about Scotland's ancient universities, I think that he should address himself to the relationship between those three important offices, two of which are currently elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to move to that point, Mr. Gourlay, because, quite rightly, you would call me to order. However, the principal is the administrative head of the university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to move towards a system of greater industrial democracy, we should start with public bodies, where we have the power at present to do so, and set examples in that area. Here in the Bill we have a small way in which we could take a step towards that. It may be that the wording of my amendment, for which I have already apologised, may not be correct, but I believe in principle that we should start seriously to consider how we can ensure that people such as those who hold important positions should be chosen by all who are employed by, or students of, such organisations. In my view, past students, too, should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak at length about my hon Friend's amendment, which I support in principle. I tabled amendment No. 267 because I believe that the Under-Secretary and the Government might not immediately accede to my hon Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of the Under-Secretary's close association with many of the people concerned with universities in Scotland, and I argue that there is a strong case for accepting my amendment. It is not a radical amendment—quite the reverse. It suggests that Edinburgh university should be in line with the other universities. The Government's proposals seek that the responsibility for the appointment of principals should be transferred from the Secretary of State, acting on behalf of the Crown. In fact that has not been done anyway. I believe that in reality they have been allowing the court to make a recommendation to turn the 	<i>de facto</i> position into the 	<i>de jure</i> position that the court should appoint the principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding my support for my hon Friend's more radical proposals, it seems to me a sensible change that the Government are making. They are saying that in Glasgow, St. Andrews and Aberdeen the court will be the appropriate body to appoint the principal. The court, consisting of representatives of the senate, the graduates and now, I am glad to say, of the students, and the local authorities—that is, all the various interests in the university—is the sensible
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
body to appoint the administrative head of the university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that for Glasgow, St. Andrews and Aberdeen, why cannot the Government propose the same for Edinburgh? If the argument is logical for the other ancient universities, why is it not equally sensible for Edinburgh? It is curious that Edinburgh still has a strange body called the curators of patronage. By its very name we should be worried about such a body. Curators are people who look after ancient dusty things, which is appropriate, and the very word "patronage" should rankle with a good, modern business Conservative such as the Under-Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Member realise that there could be an advantage to the Labour Party in its leadership election? Instead of labyrinthine discussions, if the matter were left to the Whips—or the "curators of patronage" in this place—that would take care of some of the divisions of opinion in the party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although that remark was interesting, 1 hope that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will not go too far down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish whatever to go down that road, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The curators of patronage are an archaic and anachronistic body. It seems to exist for no other purpose than the one appointment; perhaps it makes one or two others, but I doubt that. It consists of four representatives of the university—most of whom are members of the court, anyway—and three representatives of the district council. What conceivable argument can there be for having three representatives of the district council involved in appointing the principal of the court of the University of Edinburgh? That seems wrong. Having written about the history of the university, I know that it was started as "Our Tounis College"—our town's college—so there is a historical link, which I like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, something that goes back 400 years is not necessarily the appropriate vehicle for appointing the principal of a modern university. In the days before the reorganisation of local government the town council had some responsibility for education matters. But the district council has none. So it has no vestige of an interest in the appointment of the principal of Edinburgh university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a pulling-out of all the stops. We are reaching the end of our discussion of the Bill. The Opposition have bent over backwards to enable the Whip—the curator of patronage in the form of the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—to meet his timetable. During our debate the Minister—true to his principles and his brief—has given way on little or nothing. But this is an issue with no party political implications. When I spoke earlier, I saw the hon Members for Edinburgh, West, for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and others nodding in agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
I press the Under-Secretary to say that he realises the wisdom of the proposal. Just as he recognises the argument for transferring the responsibility to the court at the other universities, he should extend that logic to Edinburgh and say once and for all that Edinburgh will be put on a par with the other universities. That would be a logical, worthy proposal for him to accept. He will enhance his position and increase his standing with every member of the Committee if he accepts my modest amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I am tempted to rise in support of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). If something is good enough for Aberdeen, St. Andrews and Glasgow, why should Edinburgh university be out of step and excluded from the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing against Edinburgh university. Indeed, I am a graduate of Edinburgh university. I believe that I am still entitled to vote for one of these bodies—the court, I believe—but I never receive a ballot paper now. I do not know whether I have been struck off the register, or those concerned cannot find me, but I have not had a ballot paper for some years. Perhaps the democratic machinery of elections in our universities needs investigating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, since I came to this place I have always stuck out for democratic election rather than patronage appointments. Of the two amendments, I prefer amendment No. 261, whereby the principal would be elected by all students, staff and graduates. It is unlikely that the Minister will accept that wider franchise, because the Tory Party has never been in the vanguard of democratic improvements in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, therefore, the Minister is unwilling to accept that amendment, but is at all reasonable, he ought to accept amendment No. 267, in the name of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. The Minister represents an Edinburgh constituency, and, although I do not think he is a graduate of Edinburgh university, he ought to have the interests of that university at heart. I urge him to let us insert some democracy into the alma mater of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of the two amendments, No. 261 has a ring that I find a little troublesome. I have never been a great supporter of former pupils' associations or, for that matter, former students' associations. My own modest alma mater, which is not so much redbrick as— as John Osborne said—white tile, the Heriot Watt university, has a former students' association, but I never troubled to join it. I am, therefore, not troubled by 	<i>Reader's Digest</i> type envelopes fanning through my letter box at regular intervals inviting me to cheese and wine parties and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always felt that FP associations were anathema, whether they be for former students or former pupils. It is unfortunate that my hon Friends have sought to include—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon Gentleman confusing a graduates' association with a general council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to confuse the two, but I am opposed to having former students involved in the running of an institution in which they no longer have any great role or involvement. I have always felt that that was the same principle as applied to former pupils' organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am prepared to go along with the amendment in so far as it seeks to widen popular control of universities. One criticism may be made of universities very easily: that they are answerable to far too few people and tend to operate outwith the normal areas of responsibility in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 267,1 know that my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire has had a long-standing love affair with the university of Edinburgh, and that he has its best interests at heart. I remember the time when the last vice-chancellor but one was appointed, many years ago. I remember the appointment of the curators of patronage, and the battles in Edinburgh council for membership of such an august and austere body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that Edinburgh university should now be brought into line with the other institutions in Scotland. Although I welcome the general thrust of clause 17, I think, first, that Edinburgh should be included and, secondly, that if there is to be a revision that brings these principals into line with the other schemes, it would be unfortunate if we did not take the opportunity to extend democratic control to the election of the principal by staff and students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to include former students, but with some misgivings. I feel that if former students wish to be involved in the running of a university, or to support that university, there are other ways in which they can do so. But I hope that the Minister will look favourably on both the amendments. In the unlikely event of his not feeling able to support amendment No. 261, I would be interested to hear why he will not support amendment No. 267, why he has sought to omit Edinburgh and why he has not sought to provide an opportunity in the clause for us to include Edinburgh university. I hope that this is not part of the Government's preoccupation with the city of Edinburgh and the preservation of privilege within that city. It happens all too often, in connection with legislation, that the Government bow to anything reactionary that may be said in the city of Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has made it clear that he does not like associations of old boys or former pupils. I take it that he is not about to join the Social Democratic Party, which seems to be the old boys' association for Labour Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it hard to take amendment No. 261 seriously. I cannot envisage the urbane and stylish hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) offering himself for election in such circumstances. I think that he would want to be very much a part of the university establishment rather than someone who is out in the streets trying to persuade students and members of the university staff to vote. It is not a shop-steward who is being elected; it is a man whose qualifications and abilities can be properly assessed only by a small group of people, and it is only a small group of people that is usually involved when such an appointment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>871</span>
I can understand the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) supporting the idea of mass elections for every post. Why stop at university principals? I am sure that the hon Member would like to see almost every post filled in that way. But the support of the hon Member for South Ayrshire for amendment No. 261 surprises me, even though it is lukewarm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have to decide whether to have a one-man, one-vote ballot or whether to introduce the block vote. Perhaps the NUS would decide on a candidate and cast several thousand votes for him. The Association of University Teachers would have a block vote, and so would NUPE and the Transport and General Workers Union. A shop steward of the Transport and General Workers Union would cast his 6 million votes, and that is how the election of the principal of the university would be decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman not accept that the 	<i>status quo</i> in Edinburgh university, involving the curators of patronage, strongly resembles the magic circle system of election that produced Tory Prime Ministers such as Lord Home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It produced very good Conservative Prime Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be in the Committee's interests to explore further the senselessness of amendment No. 261. It would be no help to university students, staff or the public. It would be a waste of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what to say to the hon Member for South Ayrshire about amendment No. 267. The last thing that I wish to do is to embarrass him and I do not want to make him angry at this late stage in the proceedings. However, in tabling the amendment he registered a point which is worthy of consideration, and more. My only reason for not accepting the amendment today is that, contrary to earlier debates, we have not had consultation on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the curators of patronage elect not only the principal, but 16 professors. I accept in principle the point raised by the hon Gentleman, which is supported by his hon Friends, and, if I am to believe what he suggests, is supported silently by one or two of my hon Friends. I am not sure whether that is true, but that is what he suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to accept the amendment, but it would be unfair to do so without going back to the district council and the university and obtaining their views on the matter. Therefore, we accept the point in principle; between now and Report we shall consult the dis ric council and the university with a view to proposing an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the most generous concessions that the Minister has given during the Committee stage. However, will he read out who the curators of patronage are and who appointed them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are four nominees of the university court and the three nominees of the City of Edinburgh district council. I am happy to consider the matter further on Report, as outlined, despite the fact that the amendment is supported by the hon Member for West Stirlingshire. I can advise the Committee that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
the curators of patronage are the Hon Lord Cameron, Professor Sir Frederick Stewart, Professor L. G. Whitby, Professor I. G. Stewart, the right hon The Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Councillor W. K. Macfarlane and Councillor D. Drummond-Young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept most of what the Minister said about the drafting of the amendment, though I did not like his cavalier dismissal of the principle involved. I also accept much of what my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said about the former students. It was not the right wording, and I believe that I said so. Perhaps it should refer to graduates of the university; but, on reflection, I might even have reservations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister spoke about block votes, and so on, he came close to convincing my hon Friends and me that perhaps that is the way forward; his argument may have been more convincing than mine—even though he may have thought he was being funny. Many of us believe that there are methods by which large numbers of people can be represented, and that is a perfectly valid way of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, I should not object to standing as principal of any of the universities in Scotland under the method. It is a perfectly legitimate way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the amendment is badly worded. I should like to examine its drafting at a later stage. However, despite my hon Friend's advice, I should wish to withdraw the amendment. I believe that under the rules, my hon Friend may still comment further on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what was said by my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I have received the only generous concession given by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that on Report the amendment may go down in history as a South Ayrshire amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to have such an appellation applied to the amendment. It is a logical amendment, and I foresee that many of the Government Back Benchers could show some understanding and agree to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister, on the Government's behalf, has accepted in principle what I have said and will consult the university of Edinburgh and the district council on that basis. I predict that the district council will say that it likes the existing position. We must realise that it will say that because the only way that it is involved is through the curators of patronage and it may wish to hang on to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the university, as a body, will realise the wisdom in what we suggest. The last time a principal was elected, the curators set up a consultative committee to advise them, because they recognised that they no longer represented the interests involved. I have suggested that it would be much more appropriate to transfer the power to the court. In the light of what the Government said, I hope that they will make it clear in their consultations that it is their view that the

The amendment will simply amend the short title of the Bill by dropping its designation as the No. 2 Bill. It is purely a technical matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is already an Education (Scotland) Act 1980. If this Bill becomes law, despicable legislation though it may be, will it not be the Education (Scotland) Act 1981, rather than 1980? Should there, therefore, not be another drafting amendment to change 1980 to 1981?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will become the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 when it is enacted. But it is a 1980 Bill because it was presented in 1980 and it is the No. 2 Bill in 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will "1980" be changed to "1981"? Will that be on Report, when it goes through the Lords, when the Queen gives it her autograph, or when?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be enacted as the 1981 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It says 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does. The hon Gentleman's point is correct: we are dropping "(No. 2)". He asked

when it will become the 1981 Act. The Bill will be enacted in 1981 and it will obviously be a 1981 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the Committee is getting into a bit of a kerfuffle about nothing. The year of the Bill is automatically dealt with when it becomes an Act of Parliament. The (No. 2) part of the title is being amended for a different purpose. It was to draw a distinction between the Bill and the previous Act, discussion on which was begun in the same year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 21, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Will it be in of order for the Committee to adjourn now and deal with the new clauses at 4.30 pm rather than begin them in a half-cocked manner now? I know that it is the Committee's intention to move quickly, but we have got this far, and one of the new clauses may not be moved anyway, so we shall not have to sit too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—	<i>[Mr. O'Neill.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned accordingly at six minutes to One o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
