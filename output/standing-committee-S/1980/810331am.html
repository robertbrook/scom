<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I should like to know whether it is out of order, or merely a gross discourtesy to the Committee, that on Monday, when other business is normally being attended to, a press conference was held to introduce in the form of a statutory instrument the regulations which form the basis of discussion on this clause.<br><br>
Yesterday morning I telephoned the Minister's private office at Dover House and asked for a copy of the most up-to-date list of schools participating in the scheme, because I wished to have an idea what institutions had accepted since the last time that a list was published. The Minister's private office told me that it would do what it could to produce such a list.<br><br>
I left the building yesterday to return to Edinburgh by 2 pm. When I got home, I received a phone call from my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), who informed me that the set of regulations, in the form of a statutory instrument, had been published. 1 shall not say that the Minister did not take all steps to provide me with the relevant information—I have not yet spoken to my secretary this morning and a copy of the document may have been sent to me yesterday—but the publication of the Bill was some considerable time before Christmas and it is now the end of March, and in that length of time it should have been possible before now to publish the regulations.<br><br>
I appreciate that on another occasion, in respect of the assisted places scheme—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is not permitted to make a speech on a point of order. Sufficient information has been given for the Chair to rule, and my ruling is that what has been referred to has nothing to do with the Chair. It may be an inconvenience to the hon Gentleman and the Committee, but it certainly does not come within the jurisdiction of the Chair. Therefore, I cannot permit discussion on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Perhaps I may be allowed to comment for the benefit of the Committee. The regulations, under the 1980 Act, are on the Table this morning for the benefit of hon Members. The order was laid yesterday because we are discussing under clause 5 the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
As has applied on other parts of the Bill, when we have been discussing each part we have made available to members of the Committee as much information as possible, so that they may be better able to participate in the debates. There was no discourtesy. My right hon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
Friend the Secretary of State gave notice on Second Reading that orders would be laid under the 1980 Act for this purpose, and we are proceeding according to that plan.<br><br>
As to the hon Gentleman's point about a request for a list of schools, there was no courtesy of any kind intended. If he has any difficulty in that regard, I shall deal with it this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point about the list of schools. It is appended to the statutory instrument, so that information is now available. But it would have been of assistance if someone had told people in the office that the list was to be part of the statutory instrument, because I spent part of the weekend and yesterday drafting amendments directly relating to these regulations. It would have helped if the regulations had been produced earlier.<br><br>
Twenty-four hours' notice is not adequate if we are to have a serious and well-informed discussion. When we reach the discussions on the implications of the regulations perhaps the Chair will grant an adjournment, in order that we can look at them in some detail, before actual consideration of them under new section 75B.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's points are now on the record, and I shall take note of them.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to his new position as an unpaid deputy Opposition Whip.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
It shows the benefit of a selective grammar school education and the experience of teaching in a private school, in that they enable one to get into such an eminent position so quickly in one's parliamentary career.<br><br>
The amendments are, beyond question, in the nature of wrecking amendments—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I believe that it is against the rules of the House to table what is termed a "wrecking" amendment. Therefore, is it in order for the hon Member to suggest that these are wrecking amendments, when you have selected them for debate —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If wrecking amendments were tabled, they would not be selected, and normally they are not allowed on the Amendment Paper. I understood that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) was using a rather descriptive phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of considering for a moment that the Opposition would table wrecking amendments. They have just removed one or two of the lighthouses on the course. However, four of the amendments suggest that the scheme should go ahead only with the permission of certain organisations.<br><br>
If one considers these amendments and the Opposition's view of parental choice together with their view of the Tenants' Rights, Etc Act, one understands that they do not want an individual to make a decision for himself or his family. They would prefer that such decisions be made by education authorities, school councils, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the General Teaching Council, or trade unions—a clear example of the corporate State. They consider that an individual must not make a decision; a corporate body must make it for him.<br><br>
That, unfortunately, is at the heart of the new Socialism that is arising in this country. At one time the Labour Party could be relied upon to be interested in individual freedom, liberty and responsibility. We have now reached the stage at which decisions can be taken only if the corporate State in all its various manifestations agrees. It would make it difficult for this part of the Bill to be implemented if the Government had to get the agreement of all those differing bodies. If all those bodies agreed, I am sure that the Opposition would table more clauses which would include the Labour Party as a body that ultimately had to give permission before the Bill was implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon Gentleman concede that it is strange that bodies as diverse as the General Teaching Council and COSLA, which are representative of a wide range of political and educational opinion, have not approved this part of the legislation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be true, but if people do not approve of the legislation, no one will take up places in the scheme. That is the essential judgment in respect of whether people want the scheme, or whether even a few want it. If those places are taken up, that will show that at least some people want this sort of legislation. If no one takes up those places, the Opposition's case will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
proved. I shall be interested to see—I accept that it would probably be an infringement of privacy—how many teachers, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland and even members of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, decide to avail themselves of the opportunities given by the Bill.<br><br>
We have already heard much about the money that will be spent. But a small minority want their children to attend private schools. The Opposition, at least on the Floor of the House, are always talking about the rights of minorities, and about how they stand up for those rights. Yet in this instance the Opposition appear to be standing on those rights rather than standing up for them. They are not interested in them.<br><br>
The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is absent, with or without leave. I believe that he is abroad undertaking a project. I hope that he spends a week on it and a month writing it up, so that the hon Member for Cathcart can remain for some weeks and get into the habit of being the deputy unpaid Whip. I also hope that he will take up the proper role of the Whip, which is to be silent and not to make long, dreary speeches.<br><br>
I return to the matter of money. The minority pay taxes. Therefore, it is nonsense to suggest that they will be getting something for nothing. If the children of that minority were to be educated in State sector schools, they would cost the local authority money. My hon Friend the Minister might explain to us at some time exactly what the cost would be for children coming from the private sector into the public sector because that, too, would cost the taxpayers money.<br><br>
Therefore, the argument about money does not favour the Opposition, because the parents who want their children to go to private schools are taxpayers. Indeed, if the Opposition were to pursue that argument, they might say that the assisted places scheme was wrong because many who paid fees for private education would receive no help with those fees from the taxes that they pay. In fact, the scheme, as the statutory instrument makes it clear, will help those who, in some cases, earn considerably less than £10,000 a year, because it goes down to a level at which people probably pay no tax. The page which outlines the help given in respect of income shows that the poorly paid will be able to take advantage of the scheme.<br><br>
I thought about interrupting the hon Member for West Stirlingshire last week, but I decided to wait until I made my speech. It may be worthwhile for the Opposition to put their mind to the question which arises from their arguments against private education and the assisted places scheme. If they are saying that educationally private education is wrong, perhaps they will make it clear that they will take steps to abolish private education, that they will make it illegal for anyone to pay for his child's education and illegal for anyone to send his child to a private school. Perhaps they will also make it illegal in retrospect for anyone to teach at a private school.<br><br>
We know that the Opposition do not want to be out-Lefted by the Social Democrats. If I have understood one SDP policy over the weekend, it is that which emanated from Mrs. Williams, that she will abolish private education. Perhaps the Labour Party should be concerned that it is being out-Lefted by the SDP. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
must make the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) look like a moderate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the hon Gentleman's remarks about Mrs. Shirley Williams and the SDP in relation to State and private schools. My impression of what she said on one occasion was that there should be an exchange of pupils between them. It is typical of the SDP that it does not know what its policies are on any of these issues.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to enter the inter-Left struggle. I understood that Mrs. Williams was advocating exchange as an interim arrangement, but that she wished in the long run to abolish private education. Perhaps in the course of our debates on the assisted places scheme—I have no doubt that we shall have a few of them, perhaps until about lunchtime on Thursday—the Opposition will make their position clear. We understand that they would abolish the assisted places scheme, but will they take their educational argument one step further and abolish private education altogether? [Hon Members: "Yes."] Perhaps one of their official spokesmen, as opposed to unofficial spokesmen from the more Left-wing part of the party, will state the party's views on this. We know from the recent Labour Party conference in Scotland that the Labour Party spokesman on education in Scotland is in enough hot water, without my inviting him to get into further hot water.<br><br>
If the argument is that parents should not pay to get educational advantage for their children, neither should they be allowed to pay for tuition to get educational advantage, even if their child goes to a State sector school. If paying to send a child to a private school is wrong for educational reasons, I would consider that it is wrong to hire a tutor to coach a child who goes to the local State school. 1 might well be consigned to prison, because yesterday I gave some free higher mathematics tuition to my daughter. Perhaps that is wrong, because I am giving her educational advantage which I should not give her.<br><br>
Perhaps this is the central theme of the argument: it was suggested to me at the weekend that the SDP— and probably the Labour Party is the same—would prefer to see human reproduction by cloning, so that everybody could be a mirror image of everybody else. If that is what they want in education and society, let them say so.<br><br>
We want the choice that goes with the parental charter and with the ability of a group of people, small in number though they may be—I thought that minorities had rights, and that the Labour Party stood for that—to send their children to private schools. I hope that my hon Friend the Minister will resist the amendments, which of course are not wrecking, but are designed to remove the navigational aids on the course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) has ranged widely, from Mrs. Williams to the SDP and cloning. That is a precedent which you have obviously assented to, Mr. Gourlay, by your silence. I wish to reply to the hon Gentleman in similar vein.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was rather taken with the remarks of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), because they appeared to be part of something very like a clause stand part debate. I said earlier that it might be wiser to debate the amendments in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would, and if you allowed me to make such a speech, Mr. Gourlay, that would be agreeable. As you do not disapprove, I shall do so.<br><br>
We have always regarded the clause as the most objectionable part of the Bill. The Secretary of State appreciated that when he introduced the Bill on Second Reading. He described our attitude as a mixture of misunderstanding and prejudice. That description is to be found in column 1006 of the <i>Official Report</i> for 12 February 1981. He was interrupted at that point by the Leader of the Liberal Party, who asked which educational bodies in Scotland—if there was a single one— supported the Bill. The Secretary of State undertook in reply that the Under-Secretary would reply to that point when he wound up the debate. The Under-Secretary did not do so. He has not yet, and the Government have never yet, produced the name of a single authoritative education organisation in Scotland that supports the clause, or even the Bill as a whole.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary referred to a public opinion poll and to something on a television programme in Scotland. I should be very glad if he would give us the dates of those polls and their results so that we might look them up. But there is no evidence from any of the professional organisations that they approve of the proposals in the clause. Indeed, I think that the hon Member for Argyll is a representative, adviser, hack or something similar of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association. The association said of the consultative paper on the assisted places scheme:
<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, the final paragraph of the consultative paper, which refers to the phasing out of the block grant and its replacement by money from the Assisted Places Scheme, suggests to us the conclusion that the main objective of the scheme is not to provide parental choice, but to restore financial assistance from public funds to the grant-aided schools and to extend such assistance to independent schools. If this is the Government's objective, or a large part of its objective, it should so state unequivocally and have the proposal debated on its merits rather than confuse the issue by alleging that the extension of parental choice and the provision of a 'new bursary scheme for lower income families' are the objectives."</p></blockquote>
We repeatedly make the objection to the Government's proposals, whether on the sale of council houses or on fee-paying schools, that the Government fudge the issue and deliberately distort their aim. They use high-faluting language such as "parental choice" and "the right of the tenant to buy his house", when they are trying to reduce the taxpayer's burden and put it on the backs of somebody else, and to privatise as much public property as they can. In the context of major cuts in the public education sector, they have seen fit in the Bill to provide additional funds for a sector that caters for the education of an extremely tiny, select minority. This is our objection in principle to the clause.<br><br>
Later in his speech on Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that pupils would be admitted to suitable fee-paying schools if they could prove themselves
<br><blockquote><p>"capable of benefiting from the education provided".</p></blockquote>
That was the phrase used in the regulations published
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
yesterday. However, he contradicted himself only a few minutes later in the same speech. Having referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"a bridge between the public sector and the private sector",</p></blockquote>
he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme is fundamentally an effort to rebuild that bridge."</p></blockquote>
How does the Secretary of State propose to rebuild that bridge? In 1978-79 the amount that went to grant-aided schools was reduced to £1.1 million. In 1980-81 this Government tried to pretend that public money was at a premium, that we could not afford this, that and the other and that they were saving candle ends here, there and everywhere. Nevertheless, they were able to treble the amount going to grant-aided schools to £3.4 million, although, as I have said, vicious cuts were made in every other sphere of the education system, right from nursery schools to universities.<br><br>
One has only to read the White Paper and reports of reactions to it in Scotland to see what dismay that has caused among those in higher education through to nursery provision. This pampered and privileged section of the education system, which provides for a very tiny minority of children, is to be further advantaged at a time when the Government pretend that cash is so short that the rest of the education system is to suffer comprehensively.<br><br>
The evil is compounded by the Government's arguments, not least that produced this morning, half jocularly, but half seriously—the Government are engaging in a soft sell exercise—that low income families will benefit. The Tory Party has suddenly become the champion of low income groups.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said—I should like the Minister to reply to this in detail—"irrespective of ability". That is a crucial point. Some of the amendments refer to "bright" children. The Secretary of State precluded that in his speech on Second Reading. He said of the children who will go to these schools:
<br><blockquote><p>"Some may be very able, some may be not particularly able and some may be not very able."</p></blockquote>
That is not very elegant phraseology, but we gathered that the gist of the matter was that children could go to these schools irrespective of ability. In other words, there would be gold-plated comprehensive schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to lengthen the hon Member's speech, but I am happy to show my charity this morning by including in the list of amendments that we are discussing amendment No. 143, in page 27, line 16, after "pupils", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"of any ability, good, bad, or indifferent."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a deeply touching ruling, Mr. Gourlay, which I appreciate very much. It helps me enormously.<br><br>
There is a very important point of principle. The Government must assert now that these places in 41 schools are available to every child, irrespective of his or her ability, and that there will be no entrance examination. As my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) has said, there is already an examination prepared. If the Governement are genuine about this, those examinations will have to be ruled out. Any child whose parents feel that they want him to go to a particular school should have that right,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
whether the child has an IQ of 60 or 160. That is the essence of freedom of parental choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon Friend concede that this marks a significant U-turn by the Government? The use of the word " bright" in my amendments was simply to draw attention to the Conservative Party's manifesto at the last election. This is another example of the Government, silently and almost by default, doing a U-turn. We can only look for others in other areas in the months ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon Friend is right. This is the test of the Government's sincerity in these matters. Amendment No. 143 contains precisely the words used by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no definition of range of ability. The children who benefit may be of any ability—good, bad or indifferent."</p></blockquote>
So if the Government are to be true to their colours and to their principles, they will accept the words of the Secretary of State himself, on Second Reading.<br><br>
When the Under-Secretary wound up that debate on 12 February he used a peculiar expression that I suppose only he could use. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"why in all the world should the Opposition object to privilege being applied to low income families?"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1980; vol. 998, <i>c.</i> 1007-73.]</p></blockquote>
Here are a Tory Government insisting that they give privileges to low-income families. That is an incredible assertion that no one—not even in the Tory Party— will seriously believe. We are being asked to believe that —whether they like it or not—low-income families are to be given the chance of educational privilege by the most reactionary Tory Government this century, even though 1 million of those same underpaid and underprivileged people are to be dragged into the income tax net by the treatment of tax allowances in the recent Budget.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Over 2½ million of those underprivileged people are on the dole. There are enormous numbers of people in Scotland who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed. Those people will be in the income brackets of parents who might want to exercise the choice of sending their children to one of the 41 schools to make sure—as far as they can—that those children do not become unemployed too.<br><br>
The Minister said that 85 per cent, of the population of Scotland was within 25 miles of one of those schools. Does that apply in Fife? The hon Gentleman does not know. I will tell him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a stupid question— from a stupid man!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman cares to get up and say that, I will give him a reply. Indeed, I will reply to him now. No Minister is more stupid or more arrogant than the hon Gentleman. He knows nothing about his Bill. He is just regurgitating the gap that he has been fed by his civil servants, and he expects us to accept it. We do not.<br><br>

schools, but he must have thought that it was a powerful factor. First, it is not true. Secondly, even if it were true it would be distorted by the concentration of those schools in Glasgow, Strathclyde and Edinburgh. It hardly applies to anyone in the Highlands, the Lowlands or the rural regions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much take my hon Friend's point, particularly as it applies to what the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said about minorities. The hon Gentleman, who is so concerned about a small minority, must appreciate that, so far as I can see, no constituent of his would be able to benefit from this scheme, because there is no such school in Argyll and certainly not within 25 miles of Argyll.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just making that point. In the rural areas, the parents will not have the choice. Even if they wanted to send their child to one of those schools they would not be able to do so, unless it were a boarding school. The Minister may care to answer that point, and the hon Member for Argyll may care to answer the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Does he think that in his constituency parental choice will be extended as a direct consequence of the implementation of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon Member is another rather disreputable character in the Committee. He gets on his knees to the Government. He gives no sign of independence in any matter. I find him irritating. If he wishes to make a speech, he may make one; there is plenty of time.<br><br>
Let us consider the child who is given a place in a school 25 miles away. Let us assume that he receives assistance with his travel, as indicated in the regulations. The problem probably would not arise in Edinburgh, where there are 14 such schools. It probably would not arise in Strathclyde, where there are also 14 such schools. It is most likely to arise in sparsely populated regions in the Highlands, the Grampian region or the Lowlands, or in any of the three regions where there is only one such school—the Central region, Dumfries and Galloway and Fife. Consider the problems facing children in that situation, about to endure the privileges showered on them by a benevolent Tory Government— a journey of 25 miles to school on a cold, wet, dark February morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether the hon Gentleman's children do it. Such a journey might involve travelling on a cold bus, with two, three or maybe more bus changes—if there is a bus, because bus services are going out of commission at an accelerating rate. The child will have at least one hour's journey in the morning and probably more coming back in the evening. He or she will need to be up at 6.30 in the morning, or 7 o'clock at the latest. He or she will need a good hot breakfast at about 7 o'clock in the morning, and will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
be ready for a good midday meal by 1 o'clock. In the afternoon there will be a long trek back at 4 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend for raising the point about travel difficulties. One of the problems which appeared from my cursory reading of the regulations was that provision was made for a midday meal but not for a breakfast. Youngsters from the deprived homes which are supposed to be covered by this legislation may require breakfast as well as lunch. The Minister is so out of touch with the needs of the people that he seeks to assist that he does not appreciate that breakfast may be just as important, because the bulk of study is done in the morning rather than the afternoon. Such children will therefore need assistance from the word "Go", whatever time they arrive at school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon Friend says underlines a point that troubles me. Few of those who have prepared the legislation have attended ordinary schools. They have never mixed with ordinary working-class people. They do not know how such people live. That brings hyena-like laughter from the Minister. I understand, because I went to a public sector school and was brought up in a working-class family. I know how such families think and act.<br><br>
It is suggested that one is giving a privilege to such a child. The child may have to get up at 6 am and go out and wait for a bus, and change three or four times before getting to school. He may arrive at school soaking wet, having stood in a bus line, and may have to go through the means test before getting a meal at midday. The child will go through the school curriculum, and then may have to engage in extracurricular activities. There is no provision for extracurricular activities. All such schools have out-of-school activities after 4 pm. That would mean that the child would be leaving school to return home at 5 pm or 6 pm, resulting in a day of more than 12 hours.<br><br>
That is the privilege that the Government pretend to give to these children. Within a few weeks or months such children will be physical and mental wrecks.<br><br>
I do not know who supplied the Minister with the statistical information that he repeated on Second Reading and in Committee, that 85 per cent, of the Scottish population is within 25 miles of one of those schools. I bet that none of his own children have ever been subjected to that sort of punishment, as I call it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the Minister, who is not here at present, may I say that I believe that one of his children went to a school at which my wife teaches. That school has more than its share of deprived and underprivileged children, and has not changed radically since the days when his child went there. I gather that the boy and the school got on very well together. I shall not comment on that aspect, but it may indicate a measure of the Minister's insensitivity.<br><br>
If he were here, I would say that to the hon Gentleman. It is unfortunate that he chose to leave the Committee now. However, I am happy to repeat my remarks on any subsequent occasion, in the same way as I was happy to offend the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) when he was out of the room and, when he returned, to repeat my remarks in a different but no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
less offensive form. It is unfortunate when hon Members choose to leave Committees at relevant times. The Minister should have been here, because the remarks of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) were extremely pertinent in relation to the operation of the scheme.<br><br>
If the Minister does not appreciate these problems, that shows him to be even more insensitive than my hon Friend gave him credit for, because he has had living evidence in his own family of people who have been exposed to the sort of influences that have not been brought to bear in the drafting of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister returns, I hope that my hon Friend will repeat what he has said for the Minister's benefit because he has the right to reply.<br><br>
My point is underlined by my hon Friend. The Minister has repeated on Second Reading and in Committee that 85 per cent, of the Scottish population are within 25 miles on one of these schools. Therefore, by inference, he said that 85 per cent, of the population had an unfettered parental choice in those matters. That is not true, but even if were that would mean that one-seventh of the population did not have that choice, so that the other 15 per cent, must live beyond the 25 miles. But the 25-mile limit is so unrealistic that it is meaningless. That shows up the weakness of the Government's overall case. If that is one of their strongest arguments, then by heaven, it does not say much for the rest.<br><br>
A more realistic test would be that of the proportion of the Scottish population who live within five of 10 miles of one of these schools. It would be interesting to find out what proportion would come into that category.<br><br>
I turn, first, to the example of Fife where there is one school in St. Andrews—that is, St. Leonard's and St. Katherine's, which are two parts of the same school. That is not much good for folk who live in Kelty, Ballingry, Cardenden or other little communities in Fife. It is an all-girls' school, so parents who have only boys are ruled out right away. I looked up the school in the Girls School Year Book in the Library—I recommend hon Members to look at it— which shows that St. Katherine's is the junior prep school to St. Leonard's. There are 400 girls at St. Leonard's aged 12 to 18.<br><br>
I think that it is true that some children of Tory Members attend the school. When I spoke there—I was invited to talk to the girls—I discovered that the Minister's daughter went there, so Conservative Members must think that that sort of education is worth while. There are 100 girls at St. Katherine's who are aged from 10 to 12. The fees at St. Leonard's are £804 a term for boarding, and £439 a term for day pupils. The fees at St. Katherine's are £745 a term for boarding and £382 a term for day pupils.<br><br>
Let us now envisage a scenario. I was in my constituency this weekend and asked a good friend in Thornton how he would go about sending his daughter to St. Leonard's or St. Katherine's. He told me that she would have to get a bus to Kirkcaldy and then change at Kirkcaldy and get another bus to Cupar, and then change again for St. Andrews. Depending on the kind of service, a bus may run only every half hour
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
or even only every two hours, but if she could get to school, she would have at least a one and a half hour or a two hour journey at each end of the day.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Imagine that an unemployed person in Thornton wished to send his daughter to St. Katherine's or St. Leonard's. It must be a daughter, because those two schools are all-girls schools. That is a limit of parental choice straight away. Supposing the girl passes the test at St. Leonard's. That school will not allow a child of just any ability to attend, despite what the Secretary of State says. It is a highly selective school. The girls are reared as genteel, civil and very polite ladies who will be making tea for the Tory Party. They are brought up to be leaders, but when I spoke there, the only question they asked was "What will the Labour Party do about private education?" I replied "Get rid of it". I saw the dangers of that kind of education. It contributes nothing to the national welfare and well-being of the State.<br><br>
Imagine that the unemployed man in Thornton has read the regulations and has found out that the child qualifies for travel expenses from Thornton to St. Andrews. A parent is reimbursed in full if his yearly income is less than £4,766. Therefore, the unemployed man qualifies. On the basis of £90 a week several hundred thousand people will qualify in Scotland. In my constituency, not many people earn £90 a week—even the employed. The school travel grants are applied with a means test. For example, if the family income is £8,000 the travel grant is one-twelfth of the difference between £8,000 and £4,766. I suppose that my constituent will be able to work out the arithmetic. That figure is £269, and the travel grant will be the difference between the travel costs and £269. The parent will be able to present the figure that he has worked out as a claim for transport benefit.<br><br>
That figure has been worked out in the context of St. Leonard's school, where only upper-middle-class, genteel parents could afford the fees. A child from a working class environment such as Thornton, Kelty or Ballingry or any of the mining villages in my constituency whose parents are to be subject to that kind of means test will be known in the school as being helped not only with her bus fares, but with her meal charges. Free meals are to be given to all children whose parents are poor, or on supplementary benefit or family income supplement. And so it goes on.<br><br>
Reference is made to a clothing allowance, but it will be available only every other year. A growing child quickly grows out of his clothes, in less than a year. But he will not, under the regulations, receive clothing help, apart from the first year, more frequently than every other year.<br><br>
Moreover, there is no mention of footwear. Does "clothing" include footwear? It is a heavy item of expenditure for parents with growing children. My daughter has three children, all under 12, and she pays at least £12 for a pair of shoes, and the children grow out of them every six months. Even if footwear is included under the heading of "clothing"—and there is no indication that it is—a growing child will need new shoes more than once every 12 months.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not my hon Friend also accept that clothing involves not only school uniform, which the children will have to wear, which can often be bought only at certain shops, and which can be more expensive, but sports clothing—two rugby jerseys, sports shorts, socks, and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon Member takes that matter up, may I say that when I ruled that we would have a fairly wide debate on the amendments, on the basis of a clause stand part debate, I did not intend that hon Members should range over the whole of the clause on this group of amendments. I meant that we could have a fairly wide discussion on the principle contained in the amendments to this part of the clause. The hon Gentleman is now ranging much wider and is away on to proposed section 75B. I shall be willing to allow a wide-ranging discussion when we come to proposed section 75B, so I ask the hon Member to return to the general principle covered by the amendments before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I appreciate your point but I think that I mentioned earlier that the burden of the regulations was dealt with under proposed section 75B. Amendment No. 127 relates to school councils, and amendment No. 126 relates to the permission of local authorities. Many local authorities have devolved to school councils certain responsibilities regarding the provision of clothing for disadvantaged children, and in other areas local authorities have retained that responsibility. Those factors would be taken into account by local authorities and school councils if they were to be given the power to exercise their permission for the inclusion of particular schools in the scheme.<br><br>
That point has to be borne in mind. There are bodies mentioned in the group of amendments which have experience in these areas. I accept that the question of regulations may be too wide for discussion in this debate, but school councils and local authorities have some expertise and something to give to the working of the system. Their knowledge and experience would be of value, and that is why they are included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I appreciate hon Gentlemen's arguments for trying to widen the debate, I cannot accept them as the basis of a ruling from the Chair. We shall come to that matter when we come to the proposed section 75B.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have been very generous, Mr. Gourlay, in allowing me to go as far as I did. I think that this is virtually my speech on clause stand part, and even if you allow a debate on clause stand part T shall not take part, because I have said more or less what I want to say.<br><br>
I hope that there will be a debate in the House on the regulations, which are extremely important for all parents and everybody interested in education in Scotland, and indeed in the whole United Kingdom. I want to end by quoting what has been said on this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
matter by the chairman of the education committee in the Fife region. He said in a letter to me:
<br><blockquote><p>"Much has been said about this proposal regarding State Education and Public Schools … another point we would make is that this scheme is aimed at creaming off youngsters who would normally go on to 5th and 6th year in our Comprehensives and as these year groups are usually small in number in any case the loss of these youngsters could pose a threat to six year education being a viable proposition."</p></blockquote>
I dare say that that is a fear of committees in other regions as well. I do not believe that this proposal is intended to provide, nor will it effectively provide, additional choice for working-class parents. It will benefit primarily, and is intended to benefit primarily, middle-class, upper-middle-class and wealthier people. It is an absolute scandal that scarce resources are being poured into this part of the education system when we can find so little for the part of the education system which benefits and profits the vast majority of our children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to the amendments largely because I am provoked by the condescending attitude of the hon Member lor Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). It is sheer humbug for the hon Gentleman to suggest that no one on the Conservative Bench understands or has any experience of working-class families. That kind of nonsense brings no constructive debate to this House or anywhere else. It is of little value and is designed purely to give vent to the hon Gentleman's feelings. That is rather sad, because we have to look at the amendments as they are and question why they are on the Amendment Paper.<br><br>
The Opposition must acknowledge that these schools already exist. Children in my constituency— a rural constituency, and part of it a Highland constituency—travel daily from the head of Glen Shee and from Strathardle to Dundee high school. They also travel to Morrison's academy, Crieff, and some of them have recently started travelling to Strathallan school, and also from Dundee to Strathallan school on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon Member for Fife, Central, I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman advance educational arguments to justify the lengthy travelling time which is obviously involved in journeys of that nature? Would you also care to comment, as an expert on all matters educational—because you have told use before that you have been to school—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon Gentleman that he is addressing the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. I know that you are an expert on education, following your many years on Fife county council. I am not quite so sure of the hon Member, but I know that he has gone to school—he told us that in the debate on Gaelic— and that he obviously has some idea of the value of a well-rounded education, in which young people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
participate an all the school's activities, rather than simply academic ones.<br><br>
How can it benefit a child to travel a considerable distance—getting up very early to make the journey and coming back late at night, probably leaving only enough time to do homework before going to bed? Such a child has no time to participate in the activities which are emphasised in the prospectuses of such schools, and which we shall look at and no doubt discuss later.<br><br>
The concept is a well-rounded education in which academic study plays a part, but not the only part. How can children benefit from such a scheme if they have to undertake the journeys that the hon Member claims are acceptable to the parents? Would he, as a parent, like his children to undertake such journeys, and would he be prepared to see them forgoing a large part of the educational provision that the school affords?</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon Gentleman intervenes, he makes a speech. If the hon Gentleman had listened to the debate on Gaelic, he would have realised that I made no mention of having gone to school. It came from somewhere else. I neither rose to it nor replied to it. He should refer to the <i>Official Report.</i><br><br>
The parents in my constituency whose children travel long distances to school believe that it is for the benefit of the child. They make that judgement on their assessment of what is available. I believe that that is a form of choice. This is a free society, and that is what we are talking about.<br><br>
Mention was made of St. Leonard's and St. Katherine's schools in St. Andrews. I am sure that the hon Member for Fife, Central knows that some children from the Dundee side of the river Tay travel daily to St. Andrews to attend these schools.<br><br>
This is surely the answer to the comments of Opposition Members: parents have decided that it is in the best interests of their children. If any of my daughters were fortunate enough to be admitted under the scheme to any of the schools that I have mentioned, which are within commuting distance of my home, I should be delighted.<br><br>
I am not speaking about something which has not previously happened in my family. My eldest daughter won a scholarship to King Edward's school in Birmingham, which would have meant travelling a long way. She did not take up the scholarship, because her father moved his job and we moved house. So, sadly for her, she was unable to take up that opportunity. It was a great pity, because I believe that she would have benefited immensely from attending King Edward's school, because children always benefit from such opportunities. It is particularly true where working-class children have had the opportunity. Many of my present associates and contemporaries had opportunities to attend good schools and benefited. I never envied them their opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman does not envy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
his colleagues who have benefited, but he often appears to be proud of the fact that he is self-made, and he may have some justification for such pride. Why then does he denigrate his own education, by saying that this scheme is of benefit, when he did not benefit from it? He has made his way in the world. Why should he consider that others would do better if they had this opportunity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That more than anything explains the political differences in views between me and Labour hon Gentlemen. I suffer no envy and feel no malice. I like to see people getting on and having opportunities. I was unable to take up the opportunities, because of my parents' economic circumstances at the time. I never had a chip on my shoulder about it, because I recognised that that was the way things were. Sadly, we too often see the motivation of envy and the desire to prevent others from having opportunities.<br><br>
If one or two working-class children benefit from the scheme, I shall be delighted. I recognise that it is only a tiny part of the whole. It does not change the Scottish education system dramatically. The schools exist. We would be fools not to make use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Whip's seat is a very strange place for me to be speaking from, and I am sure that my doing so will be temporary. Once my hon Friend returns I shall be back in my normal place on the Back Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may do better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps—but I am still sure that I shall be on the Back Benches again next week.<br><br>
I have an apology to make to you, Mr. Gourlay. On Friday I had the last three teeth in my upper jaw removed, and I now have a new plate. I hope that <i>Hansard</i> will not have to record that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart's teeth flew out, but I have to admit that that is a possibility.<br><br>
The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) made great play of the fact that a minority will benefit from the scheme. I have already made the point, in an intervention, that the minority of parents in the low income brackets in the hon Gentleman's constituency who wish to benefit from the scheme will not be able to do so, because they will not be within 25 miles of a school. There is no school in the hon Gentleman's constituency at which people could take advantage of this scheme. I find it odd, therefore, that he is defending the interests of a small section of the people of Scotland when his own small minority—if there is such a minority—will not benefit. I am sure that all the people of Oban wish to send their children to Oban high school rather than anywhere else, because it is such a good school. It must be a good school; the hon Gentleman taught there.<br><br>
The same argument applies to other Conservative hon Gentlemen. It applies to the hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). I think that there is one school in the Dumfries and Galloway area—and it is a Roman Catholic school—which would be able
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
to take any advantage of the scheme.<br><br>
The scheme is, to some extent, a con. The Minister states that 85 per cent, of the population will be able to benefit from it. However, the average fees payable, with allowances and so on, will amount to over £1,000 per pupil. There will therefore be about 4,000 places, at the most. That is not 85 per cent. There is no way in which 85 per cent, of the school population will be able to take advantage of this scheme, because there is no way in which the schools in the scheme could possible cope with that 85 per cent. Only a small minority will benefit.<br><br>
The hon Member for Argyll made great play of the fact that what my hon Friends and I are opposed to is the schools themselves. That is the case, but it is not why we oppose the clause. The clause is about the use of public money to assist some children to attend a small minority of schools in Scotland which essentially serve, and will still serve, those who have money. Only a small minority of children attending those schools will be there under the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
It is therefore incorrect to say that our attitude is determined by opposition to the fee-paying system, although many of us may be opposed to it. What we are opposed to is the use of public money to pay for the assisted places scheme, especially when the public sector of education is being slashed. Although I would not do so, and I do not think that any of my hon Friends would do so, some people in Scotland who are opposed to the scheme—as my hon Friends have said, almost every education organisation in Scotland is opposed to it—might say "Fair enough, if the Government gave sufficient money to run the State system correctly and properly."<br><br>
I am sure that the EIS objections would not be so strong, nor would those from some of the regional councils, if they had sufficient money to run the education system that they want to run. But they do not have sufficient money. The Government are slashing money off their education expenditure and as a result they have to cut back on their education service. Yet at the same time the Government are giving money to the very few children who will be able to benefit from this scheme. So the two arguments are that public money is being used and that it is being used against a background of public expenditure cuts.<br><br>
The other objection to the scheme is that it is, as worded, an insult to the State system. Hon Members may tut-tut, but the proposed section states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of enabling pupils who might otherwise not be able to do so to benefit from education at grant-aided schools".</p></blockquote>
If it had said something like "to enable them to go to grant-aided independent schools", we would still have objected, but the use of the word "benefit" implies that the grant-aided and independent school sector, of necessity, provides a better education than does the State system.<br><br>
Conservative Members have made great play of the fact that I taught in the private sector, but they cannot deny that I speak, unlike some of my hon Friends, with some knowledge of that system. I do not think that it is necessarily beneficial educationally
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
to send children to those schools. I do not say that they are bad schools, but they are not necessarily better than the State system, which is implied.<br><br>
Therefore, the Government are insulting every local authority which provides education and also the teachers who provide education. The use of the word "benefit" implies that the State system is poor and that this system is better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend enlighten the Committee from his experience as a teacher in one of these schools, as a lecturer who has had occasion to go to other schools, and as a member of the Scottish certificate of education examinations board? Does he think that these schools take full advantage of their opportunities? They have a pupil grouping from a fairly restricted ability range—often the upper end of the range—they have a high level of parental commitment, and they have fairly generous resources, usually supplied by the parents, for their educational work. Would not my hon Friend say that the State system, in its best schools and even in those that have some difficulty, meets that challenge?</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty over that point. As an examiner on the examination board, I am unable to comment in any way on individual schools or on pupils within them. That is part and parcel of the rules laid down, which I have signed. They are not quite the Official Secrets Act, but are close to it.<br><br>
However, I can say in very general terms that schools within the State system with the same sort of social mix—which there are in Scotland, certainly around Glasgow—as those of fee paying schools, the differences are non-existent, or very small. The independent system is supposed to have a better teacher-pupil ratio, but I would argue about whether the provision of equipment, books, and so on, is necessarily better.<br><br>
It tends to be forgotten, when talking about fees and so on, that—certainly in the school in which I taught—parents not only have to pay school fees, but have to purchase every textbook for their child. The books are not included in the fees. It is a considerable extra expense on top of the fees, and it is not covered by the clause. In some cases I should have thought that it would have come close to doubling the fees of a day school. There is that extra cost, and so it is not necessarily beneficial.<br><br>
A teacher in a State school can say "Right, take out that particular textbook and read it" on the first day, because he handed the books round. But in an independent school, the kids are entitled to say "I could not get hold of that book. The bookshop did not have it". In many cases the children cannot buy the books from the school. If a bookshop has sold out, that is it. So the teacher starts with a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend for that information. I appreciate that it must be qualified by whatever the Scottish certificate of education examination board calls "the Official Secrets Act". I was interested in the way in which he developed his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
argument about parental provision of books, which I hinted at. I was reminded of the story which my hon Friend may well have heard in the school in which he used to work.<br><br>
A famous school in Edinburgh had a group of students known as "foundationers"—they were in the school only because they were able to pass an examination which had been preceded by a means test. When the headmaster saw fit to expel boys from the school, he normally did so with the words "Take your books and go". When it was a foundationer, the boy said "But Sir, I am a foundationer", so the order was "leave your books and go".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to comment on that, but it is an interesting story. My point was that there was an implication that there was a benefit and that therefore private schools were educationally better than those in the State system. That is an insult to the State system in many respects.<br><br>
This must be an almost unique Committee in terms of its Conservative membership. I think that the majority—here I disagree marginally with my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) —went to local authority schools. I was about to say State schools, but I think that that is a misnomer. The only State schools, if we introduce the assisted places scheme, will be the independent schools; because they will be provided with money by the State rather than by local authorities.<br><br>
I think that all the Conservative Members who went to State schools would consider that they had done well in the world. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is a self-made man. He openly admits it. He has done well. He went to a State school and has risen to the high position of Member of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes Chairman of this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister went to the same school. He is in the ranks of the high and mighty, being the Minister in charge of education and industry in Scotland. It may be a matter of speculation as to how long he will be there, but he is there now.<br><br>
The hon Member for Argyll also went through the State system, became a teacher and then went on to be a Member of Parliament. In the meantime, he stood twice as a Liberal candidate. The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is also self-made. I am not sure whether the Bell Baxter academy which was attended by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), was fee-paying or non-fee-paying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon Gentleman that it is an excellent State school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had some doubts, because I believe that at one time it had a fee-paying element. But the hon Gentleman is far younger than be looks, and therefore I may be maligning him.<br><br>
However, the majority of Conservative members of the Committee went through the State system,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
and in their view they have all done well in the world, although we would not necessarily agree. Therefore, why should they now denigrate that system by saying that it 'benefits children to take part in the other system? It does not make sense. Surely they should support us by pointing out that, as they did well under the State system, they do not see any great benefit in sending children elsewhere. Conservative Members should consider that when they vote on the amendments.<br><br>
This subject is a bit of a con. For example, there is the argument put forward by my hon Friends and me in relation to the principles involved—that it is not right that the State should have to subsidise people in such a way. As the Opposition see the matter, it is a con because the number of people who will be able to benefit is extremely limited. It is also a con because it does not cover boarding fees. So why should not the constituents of the hon Members for Galloway (Mr. Lang) and for Argyll and Perth and East Perthshire, and those from other parts of Scotland, who may wish to send their children to such schools but who cannot do so, have the advantage of having the boarding school fees paid? Unless the Government put up the money, only a small number will be able to take advantage of the scheme.<br><br>
The scheme is also a con because it does not take account of the matters that I talked about earlier, namely, that there are large extra expenses on top of the fees and travel expenses that are paid. In many schools, all the books and equipment have to be paid for. Later on, there is often a special fee for scientific equipment for those who study science, which will not be included in the fees. Furthermore, a levy is often imposed on parents for building maintenance and capital cost which cannot be met out of the fees.<br><br>
As I mentioned earlier, there is also the cost of sports equipment, on which most schools insist. As my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central said, the cost of clothing is usually well above the allowance. I am speaking now not about clothing allowances, but about the extra costs involved because clothing has to be bought in particular shops. For example, in Glasgow it would be a shop such as Forsyths, although I do not think that that is still standing. Uniforms, rugby jerseys, and so on must be bought at expensive clothing shops of that sort. That is an extra expense which is not taken into account by the assisted-places scheme. Any parent sending his child to these schools must be made aware of that.<br><br>
Why is the assisted-places scheme limted to Scotland? Why should parents not, if they wish, send their children to Winchester or Eton?—the Secretary of State went to Winchester. The nearest independent or grant-aided school to the constituents of the hon Member for Galloway may be over the border in Carlisle or elsewhere in that area. Therefore, it might be of more benefit—if it were a benefit—to send them across the border to England and have them placed in schools there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From my cursory reading of these schools' prospectuses I understand that in the main
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
the schools present their pupils for examinations not provided by the Scottish certificate of education examination board but more often than not, by the English examination boards. Therefore, if they are to be presented for examinations by non-Scottish boards, it does not matter where pupils go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That varies. In the school where I taught, pupils were presented mainly for examinations set by the Scottish board, but some sat for A-levels set by an English board. However, I accept my hon Friend's point.<br><br>
The assisted-places scheme is a con. It is objectionable because State money will be used to subsidise a few children in a system of education that is basically for the privileged. It would not benefit those few who enter it if they were genuinely, as the scheme suggests, from working-class areas. It is quite clear that they would not be from working-class areas, because the schools would decide which children went into the assisted places. That is our major objection. The decision would not be made by local authorities or the Secretary of State. That is why we have tabled amendments about local authorities.<br><br>
If the Minister tells me that schools would select pupils who were totally different in class and social background from most of their existing pupils, he is talking rubbish. It would not happen. I can foresee the classic phrase, used by politicians and organisations, "In their own best interests" used again when the unemployed man decides that he wants his son to go to an independent school and applies for an assisted place. The school must decide. It may have five places to offer. It can select the son of an unemployed man, or a school teacher's son.<br><br>
Many school teachers would qualify, considering their pay awards allowed by the Government. If there were applications from five sons of school teachers and the son of an unemployed man, I can say who the school would accept. It would not be the unemployed labourer's son but the five teachers' sons.<br><br>
I find it morally objectionable that the scheme will reintroduce selectivity. The selection will not be made only on the level of intellectual ability, but on a class basis. Only those children will be accepted whose parents' social background is as close as possible to that of the children in the school already. Those from ordinary working-class backgrounds will not be accepted. The Minister must accept that that will be the case because he will not have any control over the selection of pupils. It will be up to the schools entirely to make that decision.<br><br>
A school may say "It is not in the interests of that child to come to this school because he would be out of his depth. He would not get on with the other children. He would not be able to dress as smartly. He would not have the same manners. He has not been brought up in the same way, and therefore it would perhaps be better for him to be in the State system, where he would have all his own friends." That is what will happen.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
12 noon<br><br>
If Conservative Members feel that this is such a benefit, and if the schools which will take part in the scheme feel so strongly that it is beneficial to children from working-class areas and other children from low-income families, why has it not happened before—not through an assisted-places scheme financed by the State, but through the schools insisting that parents who are well off pay more in order to provide scholarships and bursaries and free places for the children of the poor?<br><br>
In about 1959 the Headmasters' Conference—an organisation of independent schools—decided to widen the schools' intake, to provide schemes to enable children from a wider social mix to enter them. It has not succeeded, so it is clear that neither the parents nor the schools want to have such pupils if they have to pay for them. They are happy to take such pupils if the State pays for them, but they are not prepared to take them if they have to pay for them.<br><br>
If the schools feel that it is so beneficial and so right, surely they and not all taxpayers should meet the cost at a time when our education provision in the public sector is being decimated by the Minister. If they feel so strongly, why do they not find their own money? Why do they not put their own money where their beliefs are and finance their own schemes within their own schools and forget the State system? Essentially, that will happen anyway, because the schools will take the decisions about who does or does not come in. Therefore, if such schools are to exist, they should finance the taking in of poorer children from the fees paid by the richer parents.<br><br>
I shall vote for the amendments. The principle of the scheme is a disgrace, and it is a con on the majority of parents in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You rightly decided, Mr. Gourlay, that the group of amendments afforded an opportunity for a fairly wide-ranging debate to cover the clause stand part discussion on an important, but by no means essential, part of the Bill, for the simple reason that the regulations to which I referred earlier this morning are being laid under existing legislation. We felt it right to include the assisted places scheme in such primary legislation, which deals essentially with the subject of parental choice—and which also covers the introduction of parental choice in the State sector, which is of major importance, as we have already discussed and debated. For that reason, I welcome the debate which took place on Thursday afternoon and this morning.<br><br>
As my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) has said, it is a scheme for a minority. The Government take the view that there is nothing wrong with minorities.<br><br>
We go further. We believe that the rights of minorities have to be respected and to be upheld wherever necessary. Labour Members, on the other hand, as my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said, come to Parliament essentially to represent various bodies and organisations in Scot-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
land, not the people to whom they turn every four or five years when there is an election.<br><br>
Everything Opposition Members have said in this debate and our previous debates has been about COSLA, EIS, GTC or the education authorities. They never say what their constituents want or what the parents in their constituencies want for their children. They do not know, because they have not bothered to find out. With supreme arrogance they assume, in the best Socialist tradition, that they know best what is good for the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not giving way at this stage. They therefore see no need to ask them their opinion even of an important matter such as parental choice. That arrogance underlines every speech made from the Opposition Benches, not just on assisted places but on every part of the Bill that has been debated in the Committee. It may be helpful if I give a brief explanation of the scheme, as it appears that Opposition hon Members have not always taken the trouble to understand what they are attacking so violently.<br><br>
First, the scheme does not involve the local authorities. The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) complained about that, but I rejoice in the thought of an education system under which parents, regardless of their means, can approach a school and see if there is a place there for their child. That would be a splendid example to the whole State system of education. If one could decree anything by legislation, as far as education is concerned, I would be the first to decree that throughout the school system in Scotland parents could go to the school, not the education department, to find a place for their child. I wish parents were not burdened by catchment zones and rules and regulations which are designed to create a demand for schools and inflict social engineering on the community rather than allow parents the right to make their own unfettered choice.<br><br>
In the Bill we have gone as far as we can in that direction in the public sector, and we hope that education authorities, taking the lead from the Bill, will go even further. But under the assisted-places scheme no local authority involvement is required; parents can go to a school and find out whether there is a place there for their child.<br><br>
Under the Bill the grant-aided schools will disappear; they will all become independent schools. But the subvention to the grant-aided schools in Scotland has been made for many years, under a stream of Conservative and Labour Governments. That is why there is no new funding for the assisted-places scheme in the Bill. We are transferring the funds that have gone to the grant-aided schools to the schools in the assisted-places scheme. That, of course, doubles the number of schools that will be available to parents, and for the first time introduces a means-tested basis on which public sector funding will be given to parents. That will be much better in terms of the scheme itself and from the point of view of defending public expenditure on grant-aided
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
or independent schools, it is much more appropriate.<br><br>
The scheme is essentially free-standing. Parents will be able to participate in it directly with the schools themselves. The hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) raised the question of the selection—if that is the word—or of the admission of a child to a school. That is entirely a matter for the schools themselves. There is no intervention in that matter by the Secretary of State or the local authority. If a family find a place in a school, their eligibility for an assisted place will then depend on the family income, as described in the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there will be no new funding. Could he state from what date there will be no new funding?<br><br>
I would not claim that the Government's electoral mandate extends only to the Tweed. I accept that the Government won the election in the United Kingdom. But when the Government took office expenditure on the grant-aided system was about £900,000. I believe that it has risen, and that it will rise to about £5 million to fund the scheme. It is therefore dishonest of the Minister to suggest that no new funding is to be made available, when by a series of steps the Government have sought to increase the funds available, and when they have done so at the expense of the local authority sector of education, which is being robbed to fund the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) who, unlike his hon Friend the Member for Fife Central, (Mr. Hamilton), usually tries to be accurate. To accuse me of dishonesty is absurd. I have the figure here. In 1979-80, £M million was spent on the grant-aided schools. The funds available were being reduced by the Labour Government. We increased the sum in accordance with our manifesto commitment or—to be precise—by less than would have been in accordance with our manifesto commitment. Fo- 1980-81, therefore, the figure was £2-3 million and—allowing only for inflation—it remains at that level. There is no extra funding. We are transferring the funds from the old grant-aided system—or block grant system, as one might call it—to the assisted-places scheme.<br><br>
The hon Member for Dundee, East expressed the view that the only good spending is State spending, where the funds that are made available are provided by, and allocated by, the State. Neither he nor any Labour Members seem to have any confidence that other parties can spend State money in a desirable or prudent way. I reject that point of view. Listening to the hon Member for Dundee, East, I wondered whether he had bothered to consult the parents in his constituency either. He seemed to be as arrogant as Labour Members in refusing to admit that many parents in his constituency will wish to take advantage of the scheme, as I am sure they> will.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) defended parental choice in making such decisions as the distance a child may be asked to travel, as in other areas. He is absolutely right. Education authorities do not necessarly know best. Our view throughout the Bill is that parents
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
should be given every opportunity to express themselves in these and other matters.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central annoyed me by his remarks on two matters. I am sure that that will please him, but he may not be quite so proud of his achievement when I have told him what the two matters were.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
First, the hon Gentleman continued his campaign against the working class. He campaigns violently in the Committee as an opponent of the working class. Whom does the hon Gentleman like? He does not like the Royal Family. He does not like the upper class or the middle class, and now—if we did not know it before— he is on record as not merely disliking but violently attacking the working class. Presumably he likes only himself. If that is so, I wish him good luck and hope that he is very happy. But that is not the way to come to this House to represent any constituency.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman objects to choice in the State sector as well as to choice in the private sector. He and other Labour Members asked what support exists for the assisted-places scheme. That support comes from the many parents who are making applications for assisted places. I do not know their names and addresses, but some of the schools have told us about their occupations, which cover all jobs; for example, plumbers, engineers, draughtsmen, clerks, and secretaries. Applications are also being made by single-parent families, widows and others who, for whatever reason wish to take advantage of the scheme. However, I have been told that the occupation which so far tops the list, not just in Scotland but in England and Wales, is that of teachers. More teachers wish their children to take advantage of the assisted-places scheme than those in any other trade or profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not exclusive to Edinburgh. More than anything else, that shows up the unrepresentative arguments that have been put forward by Labour Members, including those who were school teachers.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central prompted, deliberately or otherwise, the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire to refer to the educational background of my own children, which I am happy to put on record. I have three children, one of whom went to a private school, another went to a grant-aided school and the third went to a comprehensive school. In those circumstances, having attended a State school myself, I have perhaps more experience of the variety of schools and the choice of education— not just that covered by the Bill—which is available to people in Scotland. I am therefore entitled to make my views known.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave notice to the Minister that I had mentioned his remarks, and I am grateful that he has referred to them. I ask him the question that I asked my hon Friend the Minister for Fife, Central at the time. Would the Minister be prepared to reconsider the regulations and to examine the possibility of providing alternative meal facilities to those suggested in respect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
of midday meals? The Minister must have benefited from the experience of his son who attended a comprehensive school in Edinburgh—a school that he and I both know because, as I said earlier, my wife teaches there.<br><br>
That school has many children who arrive hungry because they have not had any breakfast. I shall not go into the reasons for that, but people may not be aware that many children go to school without adequate feeding. Some of them may end up in this scheme that the Minister is hawking around. If they do, they should be entitled not just to a midday meal but to some food in the morning as well. The Minister seems to be unable to appreciate these problems and to take on board the experience of his son when he attended that school, namely, that many youngsters are incapable of taking in morning lessons or of participating in school activities because they do not get any breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'> Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Argyll may well say that it is not true. That shows that he spent his teaching career in the cloistered, cosy existence of some educational backwater in Argyll. But those of us who have taught in urban schools know only too well that children from less well-off backgrounds need sustenance in the morning just as much as in the middle of the day. If the Minister had any inkling of what went on in his son's school, he would know that such needs must be met, and that local authorities should be providing for them. But they do not have the resources to do so because of his Government's policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any teacher worth his salt in any school—State or independent—will soon recognise the sort of situation to which the hon Gentleman has referred. It does not matter whether it is an independent or a State school. To make such a division would be nonsense. Having recognised such a rare situation the teacher will make sure that action is taken on behalf of the child.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman may be interested to know that in the regulations we have copied, so far as possible, the local authority provisions, because we believe that the children who may take advantage of the assisted-places scheme should not be placed at any disadvantage as regards meals, clothing or books.<br><br>
I am just coming to the point raised by the hon Member for Fife, Central. The regulations cover the clothing allowance. In that they have the support of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, who said on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no great commitment to ensuring that the young people who go to these schools will get the necessary resources to play a full part in the school."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 12 February, 1981; vol. 998, c. 1069.]</p></blockquote>
That is covered by the regulations. The hon Gentleman made the point on Second Reading, and that is why items such as clothing, travelling, meals, school books and school stationery all come—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the regulations. They are included in the school fees. These items are part of the funding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
made available for children taking part in the assisted places scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the cost of books is included in the overall figure for the fees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a surprise to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reassure the lion Gentleman on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Cathcart, who has had to leave, raised the matter of expenditure on equipment in the science labs. Will the Minister assure us that materials used for scientific experiments, and in domestic science and technical subjects, such as woodwork and metalwork, and additional drawing equipment for technical drawing classes, will all be covered by the scheme? They are not spelt out in the regulations. I appreciate that it will be a considerable time before the regulations come into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forty days from yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can give us an assurance right away. If he can, will he also tell us by how much these additional items will inflate the cost of the scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already made our assessment of the cost of the scheme, and the figures have been discussed. I will not give the Committee a categorical assurance that parents of a child in an assisted place will have no additional expense beyond the parental contribution. That would be absurd. Parents who wish to take advantage of the scheme are catered for on all the items that I have listed—travelling, meals, clothing, stationery and books. These are all considered to be the normal round of expenses. To ask me to say that no item will every come up for which parents will have to dig into their pockets to provide for the child would be absurd, and I am not prepared to give that undertaking. I am prepared to argue that we are making reasonable provision and that we are largely following the provisions in the public sector.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central asked me about <i>The Observer</i> opinion poll and the programme "Current Account". The former was on 8 February 1981 and the latter was on 18 March 1980.<br><br>
The second reason why I was annoyed this morning by the hon Member for Fife, Central was that when he quoted from my Second Reading speech in <i>Hansard</i> he missed out the key words from a sentence. I assume that it was a slip on his part and not deliberate. "He read the passage in such a way as to suggest that I had said that we should bestow privilege, and that that was justifiable because it would benefit working-class parents. To keep the record straight, may I point out that I said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If we were to concede that the assisted places scheme is privileged—which we do not—"—</p></blockquote>
the hon Gentleman conveniently forgot to quote the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
key words: "which we do not"—
<br><blockquote><p>"why in all the world should the Opposition object to privilege being applied to low income families?"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1981; vol. 998, <i>c.</i> 1073.]</p></blockquote>
I ask the question again: why in all the world should the Opposition object to privilege—if it is privilege— being applied to low income families ?<br><br>
I turn to the first part of the group of amendments— Nos. 126 to 129—which seek to limit the Secretary of State's duty to establish and operate an assisted-places scheme to areas where the education authority, the appropriate school councils, COSLA, the GTC, the EIS, the SSTA, the SSA, the SFEA and all the other organisations in Scotland, may wish an assisted-places scheme to be inaugurated. That is typical of the key point that I made in my opening remarks. The Opposition want the approval of all the bodies, State or otherwise, before a parent can express his wish.<br><br>
I think that it was my hon Friend the Member for Argyll who suggested the inclusion of the Labour Party. After all, non-elected members are running Dundee and Lothian district councils, so why should not non-elected members say whether they will allow children to attend a school through an assisted-places scheme? The whole purpose of the amendments is to ignore the wishes of parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I know that this has nothing to do with the debate, but the Minister suggested that a non-elected body was running Dundee district council. I should like to place on record that there is no unelected body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's feelings, but that is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 121 cannot be taken at its face value. If it were made, all the rest of the provision in clause 5 would fall apart. Therefore, it must be described as a wrecking amendment.<br><br>
The suggestion made by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire was that the assisted-places scheme was a slight on the public sector of education. Nothing could be further from the truth. One might as well accuse Marks and Spencer of a slight on Woolworth's because Marks and Spencer happened to open up next door. It is not a slight on Woolworth's but it is providing competition and choice. Surely, in that regard choice in education, as in anything else, is to be welcomed, unless it is to be believed, as some Labour hon Members believe that the State can and should provide not just for education but for shopping and many other things.<br><br>
Some time was spent on amendments Nos. 118 and 119, which are intended to provide that assisted places should be available only to bright pupils. I understand that the Opposition wish to know the definition of "bright" pupils, described in both the Conservative manifesto of 1979 and in the Bill, which refers to children who are able to benefit from such education. The answer to the hon Gentleman's query is that we are suggesting that the scheme should be made available to children who are bright enough to benefit from such a school. That is important in itself, but it is also important to remember that there is a significant

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
difference in this respect between the assisted-places scheme on opposite sides of the border. This is not the only difference between the two schemes. There are a number of differences, but this one is particularly significant.<br><br>
In England and Wales there is emphasis on pupils of high ability. That is natural, because the scheme is built on the foundation of the traditional arrangements by which the direct grant schools were required, as a condition of receiving grant, to admit a proportion of their pupils from the public sector. That is, I repeat, in England and Wales. There is no such tradition in Scotland, and we do not propose starting such a tradition in Scotland in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. BILL WALKER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Walker. I imagine that you will do less damage there than you do elsewhere. I am sorry if that was a gratuitous insult to the Chair. It was meant only in a personal capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon Gentleman that he should show respect to the office of the Chair rather than to its incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was endeavouring to make, Mr. Walker.<br><br>
The Minister's definition of a bright child is one who is bright enough to benefit from the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bright enough to be able to benefit from the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon Gentleman. I wanted to get that clear for the record and so that the educational dictionaries and glossaries should have the Fletcher definition of "brightness" in respect of the assisted-places scheme. I am sure that that will greatly expand the body of educational knowledge, will be read with interest throughout education circles and will find a place in every course of training for secondary school teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would not be a bad thing, but let me remind the hon Gentleman of one important point. The criterion will not be applied by the Scottish Education Department. It will be applied by agreement between parents and the school. There will be no interference between those two parties. If a parent thinks that his child will benefit from attending an assisted-places school and is successful in obtaining such a place for him, agreement will have been reached, and both parties can proceed happily without intervention from experts of any kind—from the Scottish Education Department, the local authorities or, indeed, the Opposition Benches.<br><br>
The hon Member for Cathcart spoke at some length about, and objected to, the word " benefit" in the proposed section 75A. He showed a surprisingly narrow understanding of the word, because it is not simply academic benefit. He should know that as an alleged education expert. Family circumstances or other con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
siderations may make parents decide to apply for an assisted place for their child.<br><br>
For example, there could be denominational considerations. In some of the sparsely populated parts of the country, or even reasonably well populated parts, there may be no secondary denominational school within many miles. In those circumstances, a family with a low income may decide, if they are within reasonable reach of a school offering assisted places, to take advantage of the scheme. Their child could then have a denominational education.<br><br>
I believe that some Opposition Members support the choice of denominational schools. Therefore, this aspect should be attractive to, say, Roman Catholic Opposition Members, because, where they would not normally expect to be able to give their children denominational secondary education the clause would make it possible. Therefore, in making all their scathing remarks about choice, benefits and children being bright enough to benefit, Opposition Members should try to bear in mind that there are considerations other than academic ones. There can be religious considerations or circumstances in which a family finds itself. It is only right that a family should be able to take them into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for raising that point, because it gives an interesting side light. I do not wish our general thrust to be deflected, but I should like the Minister to tell us which areas of Scotland and which children he is referring to. There are denominational schools, run as educational charities, usually by teaching orders, and I imagine—I may be wrong—that they would be run in such a way that if children needed to attend them for the reasons that the Minister has advanced, there would be provisions for that within the schools' charitable arrangements, Can the Minister name any school in the scheme which does not now make provision for the attendance of a number of youngsters in its catchment area?<br><br>
The provisions of the denominational schools— certainly the Roman Catholic schools—in the list are normally such that children from modest backgrounds can attend them. The Minister may be providing money to support the charities, but that is a different argument altogether. To suggest that this is an innovation is, to say the least, misleading. I understand that denominational schools are run as charities and always provide places for a proportion of children on the basis of need. The Minister may simply be subsidising that group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to distinguish between denominational and non-denominational to answer the hon Gentleman's question. He will not be surprised to learn that most of the schools are of a trust or charitable nature, and most of them, by long tradition, have provided a certain number of free or relatively inexpensive places. So there is no distinction denominationally in that regard.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. HARRY GOURLAY <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>As to the denomunational point, it should be sufficient for me to say that I have received no objections to the assisted-places scheme from the Roman Catholic Church—which is very alive to all education issues—in the several meetings that I have had with it on other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
parts of the Bill. If I were asked to attempt to guess its attitude and approach to the scheme—although it has not been volunteered—I would say that it was perfectly understanding of the provisions and the reasons why clause 5 appears in the Bill.</p>
<p>It can only be a measure of the Opposition's complete arrogance that not only have they not consulted parents and constituents about the scheme, they have not given a thought to the denominational considerations that might be shown by churches.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps saying that he has consulted and that he knows. How does he know who supports him and who does not? He talks glibly about parents and others. We have consulted elected organisations which represent people in Scotland, and they are opposed to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful. Again it underlines the fact that Opposition Members do not speak to people. They speak to bodies, organisations, such as the EIS, the GTC, COSLA and local authorities, but never to people. Why do they not speak to people? Because they might find that the man in the street actually likes some of the provisions to which they arrogantly object. I feel that the Opposition do not know, and that they have not consulted, simply on the basis of their contributions to the Committee. It is self-evident that they do not consult and try to find out what people wish, not only in education but in virtually everything else. The only time that the Opposition consult their voters is when they want them to vote for them.<br><br>
Amendment No. 120 would place the responsibility for funding the assisted-places scheme upon the managers of schools, instead of upon the Secretary of State. As I have indicated, most of the schools—from George Heriot's in Edinburgh to schools in the West of Scotland and elsewhere—try to fund places themselves within the means available to them. Many of those schools were set up as foundations for the poorer sections of the community. They have continued that tradition, and we are continuing it through this legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 120 rejects the whole principle of the scheme. If it were made, the scheme could never be run on a large-enough scale to bring in enough children. But the schools fund places, and under the scheme they will be encouraged in some ways to increase the number of foundation places that they provide. A number of the boarding schools, such as Fettes and Loretto—and, I believe, Gordonstoun—are offering in certain cases to provide the boarding fees of certain children from their own resources on the basis that the assisted-places scheme, which covers day fees only, would cover that part of the funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there evidence that in the majority of the schools the hon Gentleman has referred to—I shall not ask him to go through all of them—offers of foundational places are based in the first place on a means test of some kind, and in the second place on a test of the children's academic ability, on which their fitness to participate in the school's study programmes is judged? If that is the case, it gives the lie to his statement that the English system puts a greater
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
emphasis on selectivity, because the old direct-grant system in England was dependent upon the existence of a degree of selection.<br><br>
Could the Minister confirm that there is a difference between the Scottish and the English system? My experience does not extend very widely outside the East of Scotland, but my reading there is that if places are given in schools it is on the basis, first, of a test of income and, secondly, on a test of ability.<br><br>
Either the Minister is misleading the Committee or he is mistaken. In either case, he has made two statements that contradict each other. If the English system is not different from ours, the criteria and the method that the schools will ultimately adopt will be the same as those adopted at present—namely, selection by some kind of assessment of ability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is sometimes a little confused. I do not say that sarcastically; the hon Gentleman is carrying a heavy load.<br><br>
If foundational places are available in schools, a means-testing arrangement must be in force. No one would doubt that. The ability test is another matter. If the hon Gentleman has made any inquiries about those schools recently, he will know that, in line with the general trend in educational thinking in the past few years, a much broader view is being taken in them of the assessment of children. When the 11-plus went—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 12-plus.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we saw the end of the 11-plus in England and the 12-plus in Scotland, there was a considerable change in thinking on education in general. That change invaded—and why not?—the private sector. In the private and grant-aided sector in Scotland, a much wider view has been taken on the question of selection of pupils, whether for the purposes of the schools themselves or in the climate of education generally. For whatever reason, there has been quite a change, and most of the schools now take a much broader view of the ability of children when deciding whom to admit.<br><br>
I think I have replied to most of the points raised on the amendments by members of the Committee. I have welcomed the opportunity to expand a little on the scheme. I urge my hon Friends to vote against all the amendments, for they would do nothing for the assisted-places scheme or for our constituents or for the constituents of Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on this group of amendments and also on clause 5 itself. Opposition Members consider that clause 5 stands out and identifies the Bill as the class Bill that it is.<br><br>
The Bill will do nothing for the majority of people whom we represent, and whilst we wish to speak on behalf of the organisations that have approached us— and which possibly have also approached Government Members—we would argue, both so far as Scotland is concerned and for the whole of the United Kingdom, that we speak for the majority of working people and certainly for the working class. We are certainly the only members of the Committee who speak for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0282">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
working-class parents in this debate on assisted places, which identifies the nature of the Bill and explains why it appears in Committee today.<br><br>
The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said that, within this group, only amendment No. 121 could possibly be regarded as a wrecking amendment. When the Minister replied to points raised by some of my hon Friends, he made a similar statement. I would not necessarily agree with him—because that might suggest to the Committee that you had selected a wrecking amendment, Mr. Gourlay—but I would say that if amendment No. 121 were accepted it could effectively destroy the assisted-places scheme. I do not think that many Opposition Members would be concerned if that were to happen.<br><br>
I hope that you will give us the opportunity, Mr. Gourlay, to vote on amendment No. 121. If the amendment is called and carried, we shall be doing a great service to Scottish education, because we shall be introducing a permanent import barrier—and as someone who supports import controls, I would like this to see this import barrier against the Prime Minister's policies—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey:</span><span class='membercontribution'> Selective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Selective import control, as my hon Friend reminds me. This selective import barrier against the Prime Minister's policies is very necessary in Scottish education. My objection to it is that if the scheme is introduced it will confirm that the Tories' education policy is based on the politics of jealousy. The Tories are jealously protecting and strengthening the tiny minority of schools from which are recruited those who dominate the power bases of Scottish society, which received a dunt on the chin when the people of Dundee democratically elected a Socialist administration which is carrying out the policies on which it was elected.<br><br>
The power base of Scottish society, as everybody well knows is not Dundee local authority, because when Dundee local authority attempted to implement its manifesto, it was found that the power base rested with civil servants from central Government, who stood in its way and prevented it from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) keeps making noises about the PLO, but of course he represents Gibraltar just as much as he represents Aberdeenshire, East in this House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) will not follow that red herring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if I got myself involved in any monkey business, Mr. Gourlay, you would immediately bring me to order.<br><br>
I was talking about those who dominate the power base of Scottish society, namely, that tiny minority who are seeking to retain privileges that they will pass on to their families. This part of the Bill shows the absolute objection and insult of the assisted-places scheme to those who work in or are involved in the State sector— that is, parents, pupils and teachers. We argue that, while the introduction of the comprehensive system sought to break down class barriers, this part of the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
will open up and bring back all the divisions that previously existed in the education system. We do not welcome that at all.<br><br>
Later on, I want to return to comments made by Conservative Members to the effect that the scheme is intended to help the children of low income families. But at present I wish to concentrate on the role of these schools in society, because they stand out as monuments to inequality. Within their educational cloisters, the upper middle-class and the upper-class in Scotland prepare their children to take over the commanding heights of Scottish society. These schools perpetuate inequality.<br><br>
The Opposition's efforts, thoughts and policies are directed to the removal of divisions within society, rather than to their perpetuation. We believe that this part of the Bill will enable those who are able to use the system to continue that inequality. That does not deserve the support of Committee members, because that inequality enables those who have wealth and power to prepare their children to take over that wealth and power.<br><br>
All the interlocking phases can be seen to be coming into being—that is, in the legal system, business, the Armed Forces and all the other components of the Establishment. Almost all of the people in those sectors were brought up under such school systems. We do not wish that situation to continue, and we shall not support it. Those systems act as a barrier to greater social mobility, while our intention is to open up education. We do not wish to open up education in a narrow way so that these class schools can continue to exist in our society. If they contain something of benefit, let that be opened up to everyone by the normal method rather than by giving those who attend such schools extra privileges.<br><br>
We believe in privilege, namely, the privilege to expect that a child will be educated in a school that has the books, teachers and courses to enable him to grow up to enjoy a full and healthy life. We demand that privilege for everyone. But privileges do not come into being in respect of the assisted-places scheme until the child transfers out of the State school system into the class system. Then the privileges begin, because it is only then that the Minister will be prepared to spend money.<br><br>
At present there are schools in my area—the area covered by the Tayside region—that need the money which the Minister will use for assisted places. If he really wants to open out privilege, those who are anxiously seeking the rebuilding of Ardler high school would like to use the money that will be wasted on the assisted-places scheme. They could then prevent their children having to walk from Ardler to a school over 50 years old, which by any standards is not fit to be used by pupils or teachers. Those involved in the education system of that school are doing a tremendous job under a great strain.<br><br>
My sympathies go to the teachers and pupils of Rockwell high school—that name is a contradiction in terms because the school resembles a building of which Dickens would not have been very proud. They also have the sympathies of all those in Dundee who are concerned about education.<br><br>
The clause allows the Opposition to state that we are for privilege, but not given in the way in which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
assisted-places scheme would give it. The scheme is aimed at those who are hypnotised by a privilege which will not really exist once their children get to the assisted-places school.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) gave examples. If a working-class family are foolish enough to think that their children will receive a better education in these schools, and if the children manage to get through the exam which will be set to try to keep out as many working-class children as possible, that family—especially if one or both parents is unemployed—will find it very difficult to keep the children there.<br><br>
We spoke of school meals. Even within the existing school-meals service, I remember when I was at school the ignominy that working-class children had to suffer when they had to get their white card stamped to say that they could have a free school meal that day. Many working-class children objected to that. I certainly did. It was a slur upon working people because of society's inability to allow them to provide for their children.<br><br>
In the class schools, which the Government now seek to assist, working-class children will come under the same scrutiny. Their clothes will be regularly inspected to see whether they meet the required standard. Clothing grants are dealt with on page 8 of the regulations, which state:
<br><blockquote><p>"A specified school shall not in the case of a particular pupil make clothing grants more frequently than every other school year".</p></blockquote>
That means that only once every two—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had to pull up the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) for referring to that.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that, when we come to that part of the Bill, many Opposition Members will wish to comment on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The Minister has already made it clear this morning that there will be areas in which—to use his expression— parents will be required to dip their hands into their pockets.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The record will bear that out, and I do not wish to enter into a dispute. But the Minister made it clear that the parents of children in assisted places will have to find the money for some of the expenditure. If the expression "dip their hands into their pockets" is the wrong one, I withdraw it. But I am trying to make the point that if parents have to find some of the cost of the education, it could be at the expense of other—</span></p>
