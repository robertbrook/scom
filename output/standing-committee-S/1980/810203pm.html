	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you back, Mr. Gourlay, and say that while you have been away you have missed very little? We have had something of a procedural interlude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to return to the points that I was making last week. I put them with even greater strength and confidence now, for a number of reasons. First, I regret to say that the Western Isles authority must join the list of authorities that will, in my view, be in breach of their statutory responsibilities in the coming financial year. It has had to make an announcement about severe cuts in its expenditure— to meet the Government guideline. It is important to stress the reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition hope that local authorities will, like Lothian, tell the Government "We shall not meet your guidelines; we shall protect and maintain our services." But although we do not agree with them, we can understand the position of local authorities that, faced with pressure from the Government—threats of reductions in capital programmes and in next year's rate support grants— feel that they have to reduce their expenditure to meet the Government guidelines. We, and the councils, should on every occasion point out that such action is being taken unwillingly, and that they are being forced to do it by the Government, because artificial guidelines have been set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines—this is why we have tabled the amendment—bear no relation whatever to the services being provided by the local authorities. The Government have not made an objective, or even a subjective, analysis of such services. They have not said "You need a certain amount of money to carry them out to a reasonable standard." In certain instances, that standard as I shall show, has been agreed by the House of Commons and put into law. A statutory responsibility has been placed on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better to advance the argument with a specific illustration. Last week I spoke of authorities that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
my view would be in breach of .their statutory responsibility; they would not be able to provide the level of services required by statute, 'because of the Government guidelines imposed on them. It is important to repeat that. I referred to Grampian and Tayside. I also mentioned the Borders region in passing, and now, regretfully, I have added the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to take the Tayside region—as a random example. There are some Conservative hon Members who represent—or at least purport to represent, or are .alleged to represent—the area. But we have heard little from them today. I note that one such hon Member has now arrived; I believe that another is still in Hong Kong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Hon Members: "Unpaired."]</p>
	<p>As I said, let us take the Tayside region, as a random example. Apart from its political complexion, it is a good region to use as an example because it falls midway between the large region of Strathclyde and the small regions and island authorities. It is fairly typical. It contains a city, Dundee, with the problems that a city has. It also contains vast rural tracts, such as the former county of Perthshire. It is, therefore, fairly typical in its size, its terrain and a number of other categories.</p>
	<p>I said at our last sitting that in my view, because Tayside feels obliged to accede to the Government guidelines, it would be in breach next year of the statutory obligations put upon it by the House of Commons. Today, as illustration, I wish to quote some figures issued by the Tayside regional council. I am open at any point to give way to Conservative hon Members, particularly those representing the Tayside region, to be corrected, challenged or questioned on any specific point.</p>
	<p>The examples that I give come from reports issued by officials in the Tayside region. The Tayside region will from 1 April next year be put by the Government—by the imposition of the Minister and his colleagues—into the position of breaking the law. That is a serious accusation. The Minister is a lawyer, trained to uphold the law. Some of his hon Friends are also lawyers—not quite as well trained, but similarly trained. Some of them may not have gone to Edinburgh University. If they all did, they are all equally well trained. We see Ministers and Conservative hon Members colluding with authorities such as Tayside to break the law. It will be done on a direction from the Government, though these are statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p>To continue where I left off at our last sitting, I turn to the social services. I said that in my view the local authority would be in breach of its statutory responsibility. I shall take some examples. If the local authority adheres to what Conservative hon Members want, it will close two of its old people's homes. One might think that the private homes would take some of the old .people in. But it is difficult now to get into an old people's home—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening to the hon Gentleman's argument, but he must not go on at great length describing how those matters can take place. A reference or indication in a speech will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
quite sufficient for the Chair to understand what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Gourlay. I shall pick out some random examples. If I went 'through all those that I have here, I should take a long time. I shall not do that but I shall pick out particular examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are waiting lists for old people's homes. I am sure that hon Members can identify constituents who are in need of admission to an old persons' home. We need additional places for those homes, not fewer places. Yet Tayside and other regions will close two of their old people's homes. Will those people be able to move to voluntary homes run, for example, by the Church of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further down the list of measures that the region will have to take because the Government are forcing these artificial guidelines upon it is the reduction of supplementation for voluntary old people's homes. What will those old people do? No one answers me. It is not a rhetorical question. I hoped that a Conservative hon Member might jump up and tell me what will happen to those old people in the homes in Tayside next year when they are closed. Will they find themselves back in the community? If so, what happens to the community services for them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member has made his point about what would happen if an authority is forced through this circumstance to cut back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I have made that point, Mr. Gourlay, because meals and home helps for old people, and all the domiciliary supports, will not be available. That applies just to old people within the social work budget of one authority. I say —this is open to argument—that the authority will be in breach of its statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not mention earlier—perhaps I was lax not to do so—the provision for the mentally handicapped. Far from being able to open a new hostel for the mentally handicapped in Perth, which is unlikely to be opened because of public expenditure limitations, the local authority will have to close one adult training centre for the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the International Year of Disabled People. Government right hon and hon Members mouth their support for this year, saying that something should be done for the disabled. Yet, two provisions for the mentally handicapped—one which is currently in force and the other which Tayside region plans to provide—will be unavailable next year. Is that not the truth? By his silence, the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) demonstrates that this is the case—that those provisions for the mentally handicapped will not be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to children In care in an earlier discussion. They need a child assessment centre. But the Rannoch Moor child assessment centre will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
closed under the proposals forced on Tayside region by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his remarks about general social work provision, would the hon Gentleman care to address himself to the fact that the Government, in determining what relevant expenditure should be for the forthcoming year, have allowed for some growth in social work for local authorities? It is entirely up to local authorities whether they wish to use their allocations for the purposes that the Government took into account when fixing the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Gentleman uses his examples to castigate the Government, he should at least refer to the increased social work provision in the rate support grant received by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the kind of double-talk which Ministers 'try to get away with in Committee and in the Chamber, and sometimes succeed. But the reality—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. This authority is not Labour-controlled. It will not go out of its way to stand up to the Government to say things which are not the case. The authority says that in real terms—once inflation has been allowed for at a rate not allowed for by the Government rate support grant, and once the authority has taken on inescapable commitments such as the increase in interest payments—there is no growth. There are cutbacks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend, who is an expert on such matters, tell us whether the allowance for growth which has been made by the Secretary of State also allows for an increase in demand? The briefing that I received last week from Central region suggested that no adequate provision was made for an increase in the demands on the social work department allowing for the changes in the population profiles. That factor—and no other—calls the lie to what the Minister has claimed on behalf of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. Each year, there is a huge demographic change, with an increasing number of old people. No account is taken for that in the calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can ask any logical man about the matter, for there are a number inside and outside the Committee. We are speaking about Tayside regional council, not one of the alleged Marxist authorities. Will it say that it has to do such things, when it does not? I do not understand what the Minister is trying to say. He says that, because his clever calculations prove to his satisfaction that some allowance is being made, somehow the figures produced by the director of social work in Tayside region have no validity. If I have a choice between accepting the word—or, rather, the interpretation—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
of the Minister or that of the director of social work in Tayside about what will happen, I shall accept that of the director of social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final word on the subject of social work is about children in care. The proposals mean that a number of children's homes, in which children are kept in care, are to be closed. I look at the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—he is a lawyer—when I say that there is a statutory responsibility under the Social Work (Scotland) Act for local authorities ito take people into care when social workers' professional judgment is that that should happen. At present Tayside region and others are struggling to fulfil that statutory responsibility. What miracle will enable them to carry -it out next year with fewer children's homes than they have this year? If they are struggling now, how are they to manage next year? It is clear that they will be in breach of their statutory responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have made some comment to me, Mr. Gourlay, about the time that I have taken and about possible repetitiveness. I hope that I have now made my point, and I should be interested to hear an answer. The Minister has tried—very inadequately —to explain. I should be interested to hear a reply from the legal eagle Conservative hon Members who represent the Tayside region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us move on and see how education in Tayside is suffering. The director of education has prepared a report for the local authority—such reports are sent to central Government, who should therefore know what as happening. It says that if Tayside region is obliged to achieve its guideline figure of £130-5 million there will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"serious disruption in primary schools at the start of the final term of the session."</p></blockquote>
In the middle of an academic year there will be serious disruption of class organisation for Tayside children. The report goes on to say that 56 primary and 76 secondary school teachers will have to be sacked in April 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of education, which Government hon Members are allegedly interested in promoting, is helping pupils to understand the impact of the micro-chip. The director of education's report says that Tayside's programme is
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the Government's educational priorities.".</p></blockquote>
The Government are asking Tayside and otherregions to do something that will not be possible nextyear if they adhere to the Government's spending priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One Question Time, in answer to a question from one of his henchmen, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) proudly said that experiments would be carried out on the basis of the Munn and Dunning proposals. The director of education for Tayside, however, says that if Tayside is forced to adhere to the Government's spending requirements it will not be possible to support
	<br><blockquote><p>"the programme of extended Munn and Dunning feasibility studies in English, Mathematics and Science."</p></blockquote>
The Government are asking authorities to carry out
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
such studies, and saying that that will be done, yet they refuse to provide authorities with the necessary money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of books for schools is a basic essential. Yet the report says that if Tayside adheres to what the Government are asking
	<br><blockquote><p>"schools would be deprived of the school library services provided by the District Councils and there would be redundancies among District Library staffs."</p></blockquote>
It is amazing that in 1981 we have reached a stage where, because of the penny-pinching Government, school library services in at least one region of Scotland are to be discontinued. It is disturbing that we are returning to that position. The same would apply to museum services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to an issue which is again a breach of statutory responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have tried to be helpful to hon Members. As I understand the amendment, it would empower the Secretary of State to take action against authorities which underspent or failed to meet their responsibilities. The hon Gentleman is arguing for an increase in rate support grant, and that is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. After the decision taken in Committee this morning on the sittings motion, it has come to my notice that Opposition Members have decided to ban pairing. There is a serious situation in my constituency which demands my attention, and because of the ban imposed by the Opposition I am unable to carry out my duties as a Member of Parliament in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair has noted the hon Gentleman's remarks, but it is not within its competence to rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman had voted with us this morning he would be able to go to his constituency, which would please us and him. He is hoist with his own petard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should resume the debate on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that my argument is not an easy one to make and I apologise if I have not made it fully, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) pointed out that our amendment —which I think is one of the most crucial and important amendments to the Bill—provides that if the Secretary of State is to have these powers over authorities which allegedly overspend, and have good services but just do not happen to fall within the spending priorities and political ideology of the Conservatives, it is most important that a future Secretary of State has powers in relation to authorities which underspend or, as I mentioned previously, whose services are not up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to illustrate how important this is. The irony of the current situation is that because of Government action, the Secretary of State may put
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
local authorities in a position in which they are in breach of the statutory duties placed on them by this Government and previous Governments. It will become worse if the Bill is enacted, unless the amendment is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the statutory provisions is the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. As regards the maintenance of schools, the Tayside report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools are now being inspected by the Health and Safety Executive, the Council's Safety Staff … who are all identifying hazards of one kind or another which require expenditure …"</p></blockquote>
But none of those hazards will be able to be dealt with, because of the Government's restrictions on spending, and Tayside region will be in breach of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter to which I should like to draw attention and which is causing great concern—the closure of schools, about which I have read in the newspapers today. Later in the Session we will debate the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill. It shows that deliberate Government policy is to see rural schools closed, and that should be made clear. What will happen in the Tayside region as a result is that some schools will have to be closed. The report of the director of education of the Tayside region mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"An accelerated programme of closing schools."</p></blockquote>
What follows is interesting. Platitudes are mouthed by the Conservatives, especially the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), whom I have faced on many occasions, and by whom I was attacked when I was running the education- service in the Lothian region. The hon Gentleman was full of double talk about schools. He would go along to schools and state that he was in favour of their staying open, but in the House would vote for expenditure policies which resulted in their closure. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parental freedom of choice of schools would be reduced"</p></blockquote>
that is what happens when local schools are closed
	<br><blockquote><p>"children would have to travel longer distances to schools either on foot or by bus and frequently along or over dangerous roads."</p></blockquote>
The report claims that some areas would be losing a community asset and states that the authority would be going back on its word and acting precipitately. It would be accused of discriminating against the denominational sector—which should influence some people. That is what is being forced on the Tayside authority by the Government's spending restrictions. If the Government have their way that authority would be in breach of the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill, when enacted, by not providing a choice in education, because the choice will not be there, and neither will the schools in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some examples, Mr. Gourlay. I can see from your expression that you do not wish me to go on much longer, but I could give more examples from this document from just one region and one area of expenditure. I have mentioned two areas— social work and education—but there are others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but the hon

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must refer the hon Gentleman to Standing Order No. 22.

I am, however, surprised at it, because I thought that it was necessary to go through the whole range of local government expenditure, because it is a very important part of Scottish life.

There has been a long and perhaps rather difficult interregnum as a result of the debate this morning that was forced upon us by the precipitate action of the Under-Secretary and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely sorry that what happened this morning has caused such inconvenience to the Committee, and particularly to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). Having made his characteristically dramatic intervention, the hon Gentleman fled the field—equally characteristically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
I see that he has returned, and is gossiping on the sidelines. What I say to him will underline the point that was made. If inconvenience is to follow from this unnecessary timetable motion, the remedy, of course, was in the hon Member's hands. He could have voted with the Opposition and saved himself all this agony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I turn to the amendment, because it is important that we deal with it. I tend to agree with my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) that it is a fairly important matter that we are debating and is a fairly major argument within the examination of the Bill. I sympathise with my hon Friend to the extent that he has indicated that there are local authorities which underspend. I believe that whatever we may think of current Government policy or about the immediate future, when we are drawing up legislation we have not just to think of the present but to plan for the future and a day when we may have a more enlightened Secretary of State in office, who will have somewhat different standards from the present incumbent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest—I believe it is not unreasonable—that the new powers should catch not only local authorities which, in the view of the Secretary of State, are spending in an excessive and unreasonable fashion but those which fail to maintain or achieve a reasonable standard in the discharge of their functions. I make that point, which may sound a little like unnecessary recapitulation, because I read the speech that the Under-Secretary made towards the end of Thursday's sitting. It purported to be the Government's reply to the debate, and I want briefly to take up some of the points made by him then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary started with, for him, a robust introduction, attacking my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) on the ground that if one examined the figures for regional authorities in Scotland and took their spending as a per capita figure, one would discover that Fife was the lowest of the Scottish regional authorities. That fact was exhibited and paraded round the Committee by the Under-Secretary with an air of complacent triumph. The point was made to him, and I wish to repeat it, that he misunderstood the basis of my hon Friend's attack. My hon Friend was not, of course, making general points about spending per capita. He was very properly addressing himself to the amendment under discussion in an attempt to ensure that these penal sanctions should be available for those that fail to achieve 01 maintain a reasonable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there could be a low-spending authority—I believe that the case of Fife illustrates the point—which, because of demographic factors, the geographical compactness of the area and so on, is meeting reasonable standards—I do not believe that the Under-Secretary will dispute that Fife does meet them—yet, on the sort of arbitrary table which he has constructed for the purpose of his argument, would appear to be at the very bottom of the scale. I am not interested in spending per head. I am interested in the provision of services. I do not believe that there is any doubt that while there may be a general correlation between low spending and provision of services or the failure to provide services, the real test is what is happening in terms of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
standards that may be required and, if the standards are set by central Government and there is a consistent and wilful failure by a local authority to meet those standards, whether the "improved" machinery under section 5 of the 1966 Act should be brought into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a quite interesting analogy. I remember that when the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs was taking evidence on the rate support grant from the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Scottish Office, we were speedily and graciously given the concession that there was no necessary correlation between high rating authorities and inefficiency in relation to value for money for ratepayers. That is a similar point, because low spending is not necessarily correlated with low standards. We are interested in low standards. I fear that the Under-Secretary seems to have failed to grasp that, although, to give him credit, I believe that he grasped it but did not wish to dwell on it. He saw a way of evading it and instead made what was, superficially, a persuasive political point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was cheap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that "superficially persuasive" is better than "cheap." I think also that the Under-Secretary would prefer that phrase. But no doubt the result will be morally very similar at the end of the day. In any event, I am sorry that he spent so much time on that particularly specious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his little effort last Thursday, the Under-Secretary suggested that by putting down the amendment, the Opposition—he referred particularly to me—had in some way sold the principle of the Bill. I can see that the Under-Secretary—who is never less than ingenious when buttressing the weakest of cases—has again come across what I call quite a good piece of stage furniture to erect in place of the real thing. In putting forward the amendment, we are not conceding that the principle which was written into section 5 of the 1966 Act is acceptable or desirable. There is no question of our endorsing that principle. Indeed, the Under-Secretary can end the agony of this debate—he can end all further discussion now—by merely announcing that he will abandon clause 13. We shall then be glad to renounce any interest whatsoever in penal sanctions for underspending authorities which may be available to future Secretaries of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, if the Secretary of State is so obstinate and so thirled to the idea of introducing these prospective, as opposed to retrospective, sanctions, that principle should be applied to all the categories denned in section 5 of the 1966 Act. The sanctions should not be applied only to the category that deals with excessive and unreasonable spending, while carefully and primly ignoring the category which fails to maintain a reasonable standard of service. If we must be stuck with the principle of the amendment, we believe that it should be applied across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that I shall be accused—perhaps fairly —of erecting the principle of misery for everyone. If a bad principle is being applied, it may seem a poor argument to say that it should be applied more widely. But I believe that there is virtue in con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
sistency and equity. I do not wish to accuse Conservative Members of wishing to exclude a particular category defined in the 1966 Act because those who are most likely to fall into it might 'be their political friends. That suspicion may be worthy or unworthy. But, if one assumes that those who sin—as I said in my last speech—above the line should be caught, those who consistently sin below the line should be open to the same sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee much longer. However, in his speech on Thursday, the Under-Secretary advanced two main arguments to support his contention and to rebut the case for this amendment. His first 'argument was .that local authority expenditure was rising. That may well be so: arguments can be placed in certain contexts, a gloss justifiable can be added in relation to statutory duties imposed by central Government, social needs, rising public expectations, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many things could properly be prayed in aid to put that particularly stark fact of rising local government expenditure in context. But suppose that we accept it just as it stands. Let us assume that the Under-Secretary has a good point when he says that local authority expenditure has tended to rise; he invites us, I presume, to gather from that simplistic assumption that that increase is a bad thing. We would not follow him in that. But even if we assume that ft is rising and we follow him, for the sake of argument, in the assumption that that is a bad thing and needs to be controlled, it does not get us very far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not really interested in the totality of local authority expenditure. In section 5 of the 1966 Act and in the amendments to clause 13 of the Bill, we are considering individual local authorities which are probably, by definition, totally out of line with the general trend. That is why they are to be singled out for action under punitive powers that have not been used since their introduction in 1966 but which are now being strengthened for robust and vigorous use in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole justification is that there may be a local authority that is out of fashion and out of line with the generality of local authority policy and Government policy, and which must be whipped back into line—if the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) will forgive the brutal phrase—toy the Secretary of State. Even if we accept that local authority expenditure is rising, that does not suggest that specific machinery should not be included in the Bill to deal with the out-of-line authority that may be overspending or—this is the key—underspending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said in Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So it is not a matter of rational comment from any quarter to suggest that the totality of expenditure by local authorities has been going down or ought to be dramatically falling in the way that the amendment implies. Therefore, that is not an appropriate consideration."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be based upon the fallacious assumption that we think that local authority expenditure is falling or may fall and that that fall ought to be checked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may get the occasional mean authority which has hoarded large surpluses. If the Under-Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
thinks that an unlikely scenario, he should read the fifth report of the Controller of Audit which deals with a number of authorities—at least some of which I know are Labour controlled—in which substantial surpluses have been accumulated as a proportion of rate income. It is the occasional sinner for whom this machinery is being introduced. I do not accept the Under-Secretary's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw attention to a further passage in the speech to which I have been referring. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing in the Bill, or in any other provisions that the Government have brought forward, to repeal the under-spending provisions of the 1966 Act. We are in no way denying that there may be circumstances in which it will be possible to see, once a year has been concluded and expenditure has been incurred, that there has been gross underspending by a particular authority that would justify these powers being used."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary put forward no convincing case Why, when we are dealing with underspending, it is necessary to act in anticipation rather than in retrospect. That is an extremely interesting passage. Once the Under-Secretary has conceded the possibility of underspending, as he has done in the plainest terms, his earlier argument against the amendment, that local authority expenditure is generally tending to rise and therefore there is no need to worry about underspending, seems totally out of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But having conceded that underspending could be a problem, and such that the powers under the 1966 act should be in contemplation, the Under-Secretary goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the hon Gentleman—</p></blockquote>
that is, myself—
	<br><blockquote><p>"put forward no convincing case why, when we are dealing with underspending, it is necessary to act in anticipation rather than retrospectively."</p></blockquote>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear why we need to act in anticipation. It is not the simple pounds and new pence type of argument, which can be used in connection with "excessive and unreasonable" overspend. If it is that, I accept that, once the money has been spent, there is no way in which it can be undone apart from clawing back out of next year's rate support grant on a pound for pound basis. In a sense that is getting the money back, and if that is what the Government want to do, it can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a much more substantial reason, which is one of the main platforms of our case for the amendment. There is a particularly good reason, in the case of the low-spending authority, why it should be activated in anticipation and not retrospectively. If one waits to use the 1966 powers—the Minister has conceded specifically and explicitly that such a situation may arise—one must wait until the end of the year in which services have not been provided. It is a genuine loss to the quality of life, and thus the civilised nature of society, if vital services, of the kind referred to by my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire, will not be available for a whole year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if someone is in need of psychiatric day care, or an old person is causing considerable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
problems because of the onset of dementia or just the problems of old age, and it is known that day care at a local authority centre will give them the kind of support to make the recovery which such support often brings, it is little consolation for the friends and relatives of such people to say, "Don't worry about it. In a year's time the Secretary of State will be having a look at this local authority, and perhaps then we shall be activating the sanctions under the 1966 Act to ask them to bring their services up to a reasonable standard."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only example I shall give, although I could give scores. The relatives of an old person will find little consolation as they wait the long year, and probably longer, until the facilities are made available, if they are told that it was because the Secretary of State for Scotland could see no reason for acting prospectively rather than retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It holds no water. The Under-Secretary conceded that the underspending authority, about which we are speculating, could exist. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are in no way denying that there may be circumstances in which it will be possible to see, … that there has been gross underspending … that would justify these powers being used." —	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 January 1981, c. 233-234.]</p></blockquote>
As soon as that is known, it is merely an argument about whether it should be prospective or retrospective. Surely in the name of common humanity, if it is acknowledged that such a situation can exist, the Government should be in a position—we hope only occasionally—to act at once and not to stand wringing their hands for a year, saying, "Oh dear me, but under the 1966 Act, because we failed to amend it in 1981, we shall have to wait until we get the outturn figures at the end of the year."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is nonsense. It is illogical. There are two consistent and honourable positions on the Act. One is to say that one believes in local authority autonomy and that there will be no increased sanctions. That is the one we would prefer. But if they are to exist, then what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and on the basis of the admission that gross underspending can be a problem, as we were told by the Under-Secretary, there seems to be no case for resisting what is, in all equity, a reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Putting aside all the general talk, conversation, suggestions and points made, the debate comes down to the specific effect of the amendment if it were accepted by the Committee. What is really between the two sides of the Committee on this issue is not whether the existing law on potential underspending is unsatisfactory, but whether it is necessary or desirable at present to provide for potential underspending the same extra control that the Government propose for overspending authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman correctly quoted from my remarks last Thursday. I said that of course one accepted that it may be that at some time an authority's underspending would be so gross that it would be appropriate to contemplate the use of the provisions of the 1966 Act. I also clearly indicated that the problems we are now facing do not remotely concern underspending authorities. They concern any action the Government may take in the national interest on overspending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Dewar </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely puzzled and I know that the Minister will want to help me. If we accept that there is no immediate prospect of underspending

	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
being a problem, even in one authority, but accept that there is a long-term possibility—that is common ground between us—what is the conceivable harm of putting the powers in the statute book now? If we do not, we may have to come back with amending legislation later. That would have already saved about a day and a half of the Committee's time. Why not just give us the amendment? At the worst, it will be redundant; at the best, it will save time later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman will be the first to appreciate that if we come to the view that it is redundant, that is not a good reason for introducing new legislation. When Parliament is considering legislation, unless it is satisfied that there is at least a reasonable prospect of an advantage being gained— at least in the view of the majority of those who vote for such changes—it would be inappropriate to change the law simply because the best argument one could put forward was that it would not do any harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic question is whether, in the case of potential gross underspending, it is necessary for the powers which the Secretary of State has available to be retrospective, as they are at present. The question is whether that is sufficient or whether it is necessary to give him the power to act on budgets rather than on actual expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difficulty in showing why it is clearly an advantage with potential overspenders to act on budget rather than on outturn. Clearly, if one is acting on money that has been spent, nothing that the Government can do is likely to or can possibly have any effect for the year in which that alleged overspending is taking place. However, if one can act at the time of the budget and propose and carry through a withdrawal of a proportion of rate support grant before the money has been spent, there is at least a strong possibility that a rational authority, faced with the loss of rate support grant, will amend its proposed expenditure accordingly. Therefore, the reasons why the Government may wish to take such action at least have a prospect of coming into effect as a direct consequence of action taken by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully appreciate that there is mo 'guarantee that that will happen. It will depend on a number of other factors. But if the local authority is faced with the loss of its rate support grant after it has made its rate poundage decision there is at least a reasonable prospect that it will amend its expenditure accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the only relevant criteria which we can apply to the question of gross underspending. If it appeared from an authority's budget that it was contemplating gross underspending, we would not be concerned with the particular provisions. Whether they are overspenders or underspenders, we are concerned only with the aggregate expenditure. The Secretary of State begins to act only if the aggregate expenditure fails to meet the criteria laid down. Even if individual expenditure on a particular department or project is of great interest, or even controversy, that would concern the Secretary of State only if he had already decided that the aggregate came within those criteria and wished to show examples of why he had come to that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
When dealing with potential gross underspending, the only effect, of withdrawing rate support grant at the time of budget is to reduce the expenditure available to the authority. That would further reduce the likelihood of its carrying out that expenditure which Opposition hon Members have said would be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Garscaddan said that under the existing powers one had to wait until the end of the year during which the services had not been provided. He must ask himself what would be the practical effect if a local authority which already had no intention of providing what he considers are essential services, was told, shortly after the beginning of the year, that it had lost £X million in rate support grant. That would not make it more likely to make the revision, because the resources to cover desired expenditure will be less. That is why it is sensible to act retrospectively, if necessary, in the case of underspending authorities, but why retrospection may not be the best way of dealing with overspending. In the latter case the damage will already have been done, but it could have been averted by action taken at the time of budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon Gentleman's interesting point. He is really attacking 'the whole machinery of the 1966 Act. The same argument could be advanced for repealing the section 5 powers as fundamental nonsense. Unfortunately that option is not open to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it this way. The section 5 powers, whether amended or not, are a rather crude deterrent which say to an authority "We shall victimise you"—I agree that that is illogical in terms of underspending —"unless you conform to 'basic standards." Presumably, if the powers were anticipatory, under the reformed machinery of section 5, which we would now like to apply to the underspending as well as the overspending authorities, we could say before the start of the financial year, and when estimates are available, "Unless you jump up your ideas, we shall activate ithis machinery against you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a difficulty whether we act retrospectively or prospectively, because, as the Minister has said, we are taking money away from the authorities. In some sense that is a contradiction in terms. But it would be no greater contradiction in terms if it could be carried out at the beginning of the year in which services would be short, as that is a key and more effective point in the process. The time lag could be disastrous for individuals caught out by the lack of those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may be correct in one sense. He is correct in saying that the existence of the threat may sometimes lead to desired consequences, and one hopes that the threat will never have to be carried out. But it is wrong to provide, on statute, powers which one not only does not wish to carry out, but which it would be pointless to carry out. In some circumstances, the mere existence of a threat to withdraw resources would not be sufficient deterrent and, having made the threat, it would be foolish if the Government of the day were not prepared to carry it out if the local authority failed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>

If they knew in advance that the carrying out of these measures would be literally meaningless for the purposes originally intended, that would be a sensible reason for not making threats in the first instance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we shall have to carry threats out to make the deterrent effective in the future. As with deterrents in other areas, as well as local government finance, sometimes the cost, if one's bluff is called, is serious. Exactly the same argument would apply to the unreformed and unamended section 5 machinery in terms of underspending. Would the Under-Secretary of State support, for example, an amendment to repeal that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a certain logic in repealing that provision.

If hon Gentlemen are anxious to have it repealed, I would be prepared to consider the matter sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I can tell the ban Gentleman that the problems of local authority overspending did not begin with this Administration. He will recall that during his Government, both the now Lord Ross of Marnock and the right hon Member for Glasgow, Graigton (Mr. Millan) spent virtually the whole of their time as Secretaries of State appealing to local authorities either to a lesser or greater extent to reduce the aggregate of their expenditure. In no year was it suggested that individual authorities were not spending enough and that the problem was that, in aggregate, any individual district or regional council spending was too low. I cannot recollect a time when any Government, either Labour or Conservative, have considered that to be a significant problem. The common feature of both Labour and Conservative Administrations has been to urge that local authority expenditure is, in aggregate, too high and that, therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce it. We are considering, therefore, making more sophisticated the meas by which the Secretary of State can seek to reduce that, spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider an example of what would be a more sophisticated item of expenditure? Would he consider it appropriate, for example, that the Tayside region should send to this Committee two Tory councillors to brief Tory Members who, in the final analysis, do not bother to contribute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member is making a gross misrepresentation. I happen to know that the gentlemen to whom he has referred are in London for a different purpose. It is to their credit that they appear, unlike many Labour local authorities, to be directly interested to the extent of listening to the proceedings of this Committee. We usually congratulate those who take the trouble to listen to our proceedings, and it is most regrettable that the hon Gentleman should have used this opportunity to appear to be rebuking them for
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
taking a proper interest in matters that affect local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a common feature of Labour Governments, as well as of Conservative Administrations, that they have been faced with, as the Governments of the day have regarded it, the problems of overspending as regards the aggregate of local authority expenditure. The problem of underspending—if it is a problem—is not one which the previous Labour Administration sought to suggest was, in reality, a difficulty. There may indeed be individual services in individual authorities which we might feel were underspent, but that is not a power remotely relevant to the clause, as it deals only with the aggregate of expenditure by regional and district councils.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, because the amendments are essentially an attempt to redraft what we consider to be a deficiency in the clause. They need to be taken together and seen as a whole. We are attempting to put all the criteria together in one block rather than have them spread between two different parts of the clause. We think that it would be tidier and make it easier for those who have to interpret the law to have the clause set together in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not particularly contentious, although we feel that it concerns an area of some difficulty—I do not wish to stray into a clause stand part debate—because local authorities have problems
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
with joint funding. There are difficulties, for example, with regard to police authorities, water purification, ports authorities, and so on—the grey area, in the sense of who is responsible for what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that there are formulae determined whereby the financial responsibilities are laid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in entering an area of potential penal sanctions, it would be difficult for some authorities to deny responsibility. We realise that the amendments will not necessarily clear up this difficulty, which is implicit in the clause, but by placing all the criteria together in one list we think it would enable the matter to be dealt with more satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be interested to hear the Minister's views on this matter. I am sure that he will concede that joint authorities are a source of difficulty in respect of local government finance, and to bring into this area some sort of penal sanction, as envisaged in clause 13, would cause even more anxiety. For these reasons only—we are not here to make political speeches attacking clause 13; we shall have other opportunities to do that— we seek to suggest a helpful redrafting of the clause to assist those who will first have to interpret it, namely, the local authorities, and to make sure that they themselves can act within what is regarded as the limit of reasonableness and non-excessiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the spirit in which the hon Member has moved the amendment. I fully appreciate the reason he gave, which, on the surface, is persuasive. However, he has perhaps misunderstood what the effect of clause 13 would be if the amendments were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 can be divided into two halves as regards the factors the Secretary of State takes into account— those matters which he must have regard to in deciding whether the expenditure is excessive and unreasonable, and those factors to which he may, in his discretion, have regard. It is clearly in the interests of local authorities that those matters to which at the moment he must have regard should continue to be obligatory and not merely at his discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment the matters which the amendments refer to as regards the other financial and relevant circumstances of the authority are matters which, in the Bill as at present drafted, the Secretary of State, irrespective of his wishes, must take into account. Therefore, local authorities have the safeguard that these matters cannot be ignored by the Secretary of State when reaching a judgment. If, however, we accept the amendments, it would cease to be obligatory for the Secretary of State to take these matters into account. He could ignore them if he so desired and thought it appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that that is not what the hon Gentleman wants to see in the Bill. I appreciate the reasoning behind the drafting proposals he has submitted, but I hope that, with the explanation I have given, he will accept that his objectives would be better served by the existing drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but may I give an example? Let us assume that the Lothian and Borders police force embarked on an area
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
of expenditure and the Lothian region, which could be incurring the wrath of the Minister in other respects, does not share the views of the Borders region as to the level of, say, capital support for the police force—the size of cars, or something of that nature. Would it be reasonable in such circumstances for Lothian to be saddled with expenditure if it was against its wishes and for it to be penalised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lothian region would be saddled with expenditure on the police force at the instigation of the Borders region because it is the Lothian and Borders police. What would happen if the Lothian region said it wanted to make savings on the police force and the Borders region insisted on extra expenditure? Would Lothian be penalised because the matter is taken in terms of the total circumstances of the expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman will agree that whatever the answer to his question might be—I shall come to that— it is preferable that the Secretary of State "should" take this into account, not that he "may" take it into account. That clearly will be a protection which the local authorities themselves want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point concerning a joint board, when the Secretary of State is considering the overall aggregate of expenditure of an individual authority he must take into account the relevant circumstances
	<br><blockquote><p>"in so far as the expenses relate to the functions of a joint board of which the authority is a constituent authority, the other areas of that joint board."</p></blockquote>
If there is a joint board, whatever decision that joint board reaches, it has to take into account the interest, as it sees it, of the whole area for which it is responsible. If that covers two regional authorities it has to take decisions that affect them both, so far as the functions of the joint board are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, to use the example put forward by the hon Gentleman, if the joint board of the police authority covering two regions, in looking at the requirement of one authority, took what might appear to be excessive and unreasonable expenditure—but which is not if one looks at the relevant circumstances of the other area for which the joint board is responsible—it would clearly be quite wrong for that to be ignored in the Secretary of State's decision on the expenditure of the first authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated area, but I assure the hon Gentleman that the removal of such a provision would be to the detriment of the local authority. The provision is meant as a protection for the authority, to ensure that where a joint board, of which it is part, has taken decisions about its expenditure, it is only right and proper that the Secretary of State must have regard to the relevant circumstances not only of the area which he might be contemplating penalising but also of the other area which comes under the joint board. Therefore, this is a protection which the hon Gentleman's amendment, no doubt unintentionally, would withdraw from local authorities. On that basis, I hope that he will feel able not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clearly setting out why this part of the Bill is particularly important. We shall probably, in not too distant a time, be turning to new subsection (1A) and the various criteria set out in it. The Minister has fairly pointed out that these are discretionary criteria, while the matters to which the amendment refers are mandatory—they must be taken into account by the Secretary of State. It is therefore important that we know clearly what these criteria mean and what will be the effect of including them, as these matters must be very much at the forefront of the Secretary of State's mind when he makes what I am sure will be the difficult and agonising decision whether to hammer a local authority which he feels is indulging in excessive and unreasonable expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was extremely interested in what the Minister said a few minutes ago, because he made a slip of the tongue when reading which underlines the point of the amendment. He referred to the fact that the Secretary of State must take into account the financial circumstances of the authority. He missed out, I think in a very human way, the strange phrase about the circumstances of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of the authority,"</p></blockquote>
which does not come easily to us. It is an interpolation. Yet, because it is so obviously an interpolation, it must have a specific limiting import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that the Secretary of State must have regard to the circumstances in a general sense but only to the circumstances of the area of the authority and, subsequently, of the other areas of the joint board that may be concerned. I do not yet know whether this is a probing amendment. I say that in all seriousness, because I am not very clear about the significance of the phrase. When I find out in a minute or two, I may be totally horrified and wish, at least for myself—I do not know whether I shall carry my hon Friends—to vote for the amendment to exclude this limiting qualification upon the circumstances which have to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there may be a sound statutory reason, known only to the arcane mysteries of the draftsman's office, which will convince me that it is not a limiting qualification of so serious a character as to force us to divide the Committee and, we hope, remove it from consideration. What the Minister says will entirely condition the Opposition's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may ask some obvious and illustrative questions. I reserve the right to come back to the debate when I have heard what the Minister has to say. To start the ball rolling, is the word " area ", used in this sense, as narrow as one would imagine on a first reading—that is, a geographical consideration? In other words, a proper consideration for the Secretary of State is whether he is dealing with a vast and sprawling local authority such as the Highland region, where very few people are scattered over vast, remote areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
of land, or, for example, with the Central region or another compact region or local authority district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is as narrow as that—if it is a purely geographical consideration which the Secretary of State must take into account—I must confess that I will be somewhat surprised, but it is not clear to me how else it can be interpreted. If it is the geographical area that is meant, I suppose it is possible—although it would strain logic to some extent—to argue that a number of the distorting factors that affect the reasonableness or otherwise of expenditure flow from the area itself. For example, a local education authority covering a vast area will have problems in connection with bussing children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not matter what newspaper it is. Unless the hon Gentleman is using it for the purposes of the debate, it is out of order to read a newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) never read anything other than the 	<i>Cumbernauld News.</i> I am delighted to learn that his intellectual diet is expanding daily. I am sure that the entire Committee will reap the benefits of this development, as the weeks and months roll on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the concept of the area of the authority. It is possible to argue that the word "area" qualifying the concept of an authority—if it is used in the simple geographical sense—would have certain consequences. The example I gave was that of an education authority covering a large area, which would clearly have school transport problems and might have very much higher expenditure per head of school population, because it is maintaining small village schools with very small numbers of pupils and a very heavy pupil-teacher ratio. 1 shall not pursue the various factors involved;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
I hope that that example is sufficient illustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, an authority may find itself with a very heavy roads burden, considered against the size of its population and against what a more compact authority with a heavier population and a shorter road network might regard as a reasonable amount of money to raise through the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could therefore argue that the term "area of the authority", if it merely means the geographical spread, allows a sidewise look at other factors. But I am opposed to sidewise looks. If such matters are to be brought into the reckoning—and they must be brought into the reckoning by the Secretary of State when he is deciding whether to activate section 5 of the 1966 Act, as amended by clause 13— I would like it to be done in a straightforward and above-board way, by taking out the geographical limitation. That limitation seems to me to be—to put it no more strongly—a very curious phenomenon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perfectly straightforward. I am making no conspiracy point. I am not trying to smuggle something in by the back door. I am not trying to gloss over some evil or Left-wing strategem. It would be very simple to say "The Secretary of State shall take into account the financial circumstances of the authority." What could be easier? That wording would of course allow the Secretary of State to consider the area. It would allow him to consider the demographic factors—that is a rich theme for my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He could consider whether there was a very large number of old people or of young people. He could consider all the matters peculiar to that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should we limit it to this geographical point? Why not look at all these other factors? Does the authority have a very distorted industrial pattern? Is a particularly massive industrial complex suddenly planted in the middle of it, as in certain local authorities in Scotland which do not, for example, benefit from the resources element of the rate support grant? The complex is a special aspect of that local authority and means that its whole rating pattern is different from the Scottish norm and from other local authorities which otherwise might have been thought comparable in terms of the voluntary criteria set out in subsection (1A) (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some authorities might have special circumstances regarding urban transport costs. For example, there may be commuter services to run, and a regional council may be the financial mainstay of a passenger transport executive. Strathclyde would be a case in point. It would be difficult to urge that that factor could be taken into account in terms of the area of the authority, because there might be a passenger transport executive in an authority with a very restricted area. If the relevant authority were Glasgow alone, in some mysterious way translated into a district responsibility, the area would give no idea of the weight of financial loss that might have to be borne as a result of the authority's commitments towards public transport. Yet, if one were deciding whether the expenditure on which the rates were to depend was excessive or unreasonable, that would be a highly relevant consideration. I do not see how that special
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
circumstance could be brought within the ambit of this qualification phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of the authority",</p></blockquote>
I hope that I have shown the range of my concern. I believe on this occasion that we should give as wide a remit as possible to the Secretary of State. We want a fair-minded Secretary of State to look at the authority and its circumstances and to decide, on the basis of all known facts, whether what it is doing is defensible or whether it falls within the criteria in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be narrowing the range of consideration substantially in this phrase. It is particularly serious because, as the Minister said, it is the only qualification. Sub paragraphs (i) and (ii) merely restate the same qualification for a single local authority as for one involved in a joint board. [One qualification is mandatory upon the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important point. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that there were other qualifications that would expiate this apparent sin of a local authority. Let us say that there were all sorts of special factors which would explain and justify to any reasonable, right-thinking man the level of estimated expenditure arrived at by the local authority at the beginning of its financial year. Those factors might be covered by some of the considerations that we find in subsection (1A). If they are clearly delineated in subsection (1A) —perhaps an amended subsection, if some of the sensible amendments tabled are carried—why is it necessary to worry? If they are under subsection (1A), we do not need to worry whether they are included in the area of the authority in the main trigger paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is that, even if they are covered in subsection (1A), a Secretary of State—I do not for a moment suggest that any likely incumbent or the present incumbent of the office would come into this category—blinded by prejudice, full of bile, could say, "These criteria are discretionary. I do not need to pay any attention to them. It is true that this would justify what is happening but I shall exclude them from my consideration because the word 'may' appears in line 3 of page 7 rather than the word 'shall'."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason it is important that all the circumstances of the local authority which is at risk and being scrutinised under the microscope should be written into subsection (1) (c) of section 5 of the 1966 Act. It is to encompass that and to ensure that that is the circumstance and that we are not unnecessarily excluding what may be highly relevant matters that I would rather see the words "the area of" taken out and the second, consequential amendment, amendment No. 27, carried. I am sure that the Minister appreciates the line of argument and I am certain that my hon Friends will want to probe the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Friend, I looked at the words "the area of" with care and wondered what their purpose was. They seem odd in the context, and they seem to be covered by the phrase that precedes them, "other relevant circumstances". That surely covers everything that my hon Friend has mentioned. The words remind me of a story concerning Lord Dalkeith when he sat in the House. I believe that he is now the Duke of Buccleuch. He was an extremely dull character, as becomes an aristocrat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0689">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member must be careful. It is not in order to refer to members of the other House in other than respectable terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that description is highly respectable and very objective, Mr. Gourlay. I am sure that he would not object to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend remember the interesting passage in "Eminent Victorians" where Lytton Strachey, describing Lord Hartington, said that his outstanding characteristic was dullness and that that was his essential virtue—the characteristic of the best sort of aristocrat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Duke of Buccleuch was extremely dull and very affable. The two characteristics went together. They made him an attractive character here, who knew how to vote—just. My story about him is relevant to the words that we are discussing. Someone was doing research on who owned Scotland and Lord Dalkeith was asked how many acres he owned. He said "I don't know, really. They go up and down, you see."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be two exactly similar local authority areas, with very different problems. In my area, for instance, we have an awful lot of acreage that is subject to subsidence consequent on the mining there. The coal owners made their profits and quit, leaving the local authorities with enormous problems of subsidence, building and so on, and with many acres sterile. The local populace often come to me and say "Willie, why can't we build an industrial estate on those beautiful fields? They look nice and flat." The land looks perfect for industrial development, but underneath there are old workings. The National Coal Board says that that land is sterile for a number of years, until it settles down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These words, then, could lead to unwise decisions if one only compares one acre with another rather than all the relevant circumstances of one authority with another. The Minister would lose nothing by deleting the words. I do not think that he has an adequate explanation. It is just slipshod drafting, which could well be done without.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great difficulty in understanding "the area of". I wondered whether it had been defined in the 1973 Act which the Bill seeks to amend, and I was on my way to the Table to find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), I represent a diverse area. The areas of the local authorities in my constituency mean very different things. I represent the area of Bearsden and Milngavie district council. Bearsden, which is proud to have me as its Member of Parliament, is a very different place from Cumbernauld, which is equally proud to have me as its Member of Parliament. The difference is that I cover five different local authorities and the area of each local authority is very different, which is why I am interested in what the Minister will have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How different is a new town from the commuter area of Bearsden! How different are Bearsden and Milngavie district council, the new town area of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council from Strathkelvin, with its old coal towns and villages, the new developing
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
commuter areas and the agricultural land that make up that district! They are very different in character, and in some respects it is difficult for me to represent them because of the diversity of interests in those areas, which does not exist if an hon Member represents just a rural constituency or an urban area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is something of everything, as is the case in my constituency, from suburban Glasgow, to a new town, to agricultural land and so on, there are very diverse interests. Therefore, how the Minister interprets the words "the area of" is very important to me and the local authorities I represent and I hope he can clarify this matter. If he cannot I will join my colleagues in seeing that these words are removed from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have done a service to the Committee in tabling the amendment. They have shown a point of possible duplication, and I would like to give the Government's reaction to the amendment. The words referred to are
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of the authority".</p></blockquote>
This form of wording was included because we were borrowing from the 1966 Act and it seemed sensible so far as it was appropriate. I know that is not a good enough reason in itself, and I am not saying that as a justification in itself. I am providing an explanation at present and will deal with the merits of the matter in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked for an explanation of how these words appeared. It is the case that the 1966 Act, which deals with possible retrospective penalties, refers to the area of the authority rather than to the authority itself. It was thought most appropriate to try to align the two provisions as similarly as possible. In including the word " area", the intention, as I believe some hon Gentlemen have recognised, was that it would be in the interests of the authority to have as wide a definition as possible rather than a narrow one, because these are matters to which the Secretary of State " must" have regard rather than " may ". Therefore, the wider the criteria, the more they are acceptable to the local authority, because these are matters that the Secretary of State could not ignore even if he so wished, if they are mandatory factors that he has to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that what seems to have been the thinking behind both the 1966 provision and this particular wording is that there are a number of factors, although one could stretch a case to say that they are matters affecting the authority, which are more correctly problems affecting the area of the authority, such as the sparsity of the population, the possibility of oil development and other demographic factors of relevance of that sort. A number of hon Gentlemen have used those sorts of examples and I believe that in 1966 they were thought to be, as they were certainly considered when these provisions were being drafted, perhaps more strictly speaking relevant to the area of an authority rather than to the authority itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that that is by no means an evident proposition, because it could be argued that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"financial or other relevant circumstances"</p></blockquote>
already covers these matters. Therefore, I believe there is a genuine area of discussion and debate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Gentleman will seek to withdraw his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0690">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
amendment I undertake to give close scrutiny to the need for amendment in this area, with the objective that I believe both sides of the Committee share. The reason why I do not believe it would be appropriate to accept the amendment at this stage is that if hon Gentlemen will consider clause 13 they will find that clause 13(a) adds a new provision, paragraph (c), to section 5 of the 1966 Act. Section 5(1)(6) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the expenditure of any local authority or joint board has been excessive and unreasonable, regard being had to the financial and other relevant circumstances of the area or areas concerned."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it would be inappropriate in one part of what would then be the amended section 5 of the 1966 Act to have made reference to the area of the authority, whereas the new paragraph (c) simply refers to the authority itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were an argument for change, which there might well be, it would be sensible to make the change for both provisions, rather than merely for one. But in all honesty we wish to give further thought to the matter. I fully acknowledge the points of substance raised by the Opposition, which justify further consideration. We are not absolutely certain at this stage that to eliminate the word "area" would be in the interest of the local authority. If a narrow interpretation of that interest were implied there would be a danger of reducing the mandatory elements that the Secretary of State must take into account when considering whether expenditure is excessive or unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, even from the different objectives of the Government and the Opposition about the clause as a whole, I do not believe that there is any difference in this respect; we are ultimately concerned with a point of drafting—that is, what form will more appropriately cover what we both agree should be taken into account. I hope that, in the light of that explanation, the hon Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment now, on the undertaking that the Government intend to examine very closely the need for some drafting amendment to the provision. We shall certainly let the Opposition know as early as possible the sort of change—if that is shown to be necessary—that we feel is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all seriousness—to use the Minister's term—I believe that he has been helpful in the matter. I wonder whether I can also be helpful and make a brief suggestion. I understand that the "financial circumstances" refer to the authority—that is, the council as such—and relate to the services that it is required to provide, statutorily and otherwise. But the "other relevant circumstances" may relate to the area of the authority, so it might be better to try to separate the two, instead of using one omnibus phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is to come back with improved drafting, I hope that he will do what I propose. He should consider relating the "financial circumstances" to the authority as such, and the "other relevant circumstances" to the area of the authority. That would allow all the points put by the Opposition to be taken into account. There are circumstances such as whether an authority is "up and down" or flat, or the number of sheep that it has—and all the other criteria
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
that have been mentioned. I hope that that suggestion will be received in the spirit in which it is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon Gentleman. The suggestion will certainly be borne in mind. The sort of criteria that the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said should be taken into account are exactly the sort that we are all agreed would be appropriate. The question is what form of drafting would ensure that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been helpful. We are agreed that none of us wants to relax the conditions that have been placed on the Secretary of State; we are at one with the Minister on that. We are merely speaking about interpretation and drafting.

I assume that such language was required when there were many joint boards, but what is the size of the problem now in Scotland? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, this is not a vendetta against the Lothians; though we should bear in mind the Lothian and Borders police force—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the fire brigade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The "area of the authority" does not refer just to joint boards. The difficulty that we are debating also concerns the consideration of a single authority, whether that means the authority itself or its area. In respect of joint boards, apart from Lothian and the Borders there is also Northern Police Board and the Northern Fire Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. At least the point has been established concerning joint boards. I accept that in the generality of dealing with local authorities— which is what the clause is all about—the joint boards are rather a minor problem which is not related to area. That is what I was trying to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the area, as the Minister has given us an assurance that he will reconsider the matter, we cannot expect him to reply now. But he has not given any examples of what would not be caught by the normal run-of-the-mill calculations of rate support grant. He mentioned assessment for oil-related problems, as I understand it. Are the other examples not already covered in the existing procedure and formulae for the calculation for rate support grant? What is meant by "the area"? Sparsity and type of population are already referred to. The Minister has not given any good reason why it should be there at all, although if it makes things more onerous for the Secretary of State, I am all for keeping it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the latter point, I think that the hon Gentleman is right that a number of these considerations are taken into account when determining the distribution of a specific sum of rate support grant among individual authorities. The hon Gentleman will recall that, once the relevant expenditure has been determined, the rate support grant is a specific percentage of that. After specific grants have been withdrawn, the remaining rate support grant is dis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
tributed among authorities according to their entitlement, as indicated by the needs and resources formulae. These factors are taken into account when determining how much one authority should receive compared with another authority, because it has problems of sparsity, remoteness, depopulation or oil development. Therefore, in terms of sharing the cake, those are relevant factors for rate support grant purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a local authority's entitlement, compared with that of another authority, might be £X, it might be able to put forward a good argument why its decision to spend £Y was justified by an overall problem of sparsity, remoteness or oil development which it was able to identify within the community. We are really talking only of the distribution of an agreed aggregate total between individual authorities. Therefore, it would be unfair to apply that rigidly to the calculation of the maximum reasonable amount for an authority to spend on that item.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. That is the distribution formula. But I am trying to make the point that the Secretary of State has to judge whether expenditure is unreasonable and excessive. I know that the amendment relates to the area. But assuming that the Minister wants to get after an authority, surely he will need to give his criteria as to why he thinks it unreasonable and excessive. That must surely be related to the population or its age, or to all the special factors with which the authority would try to justify the excessive expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon Gentleman says is by no means irrelevant. It is of great interest. But when the Secretary of State decides how much rate support grant to pay to an individual authority, he is constrained by the distribution formula that has been part of the RSG order and usually has been reached after agreement with the convention. Often that is the normal basis on which it is done. Therefore, he does not decide himself how much needs-related RSG to give to, say, the Highland regional council. He does not say that he thinks it deserves £X million. He looks at the formula that has been agreed after consultation with the convention, and an automatic calculation then takes place which does not depend on any arbitrary decision by the Secretary of State or anyone else, but is simply an arithmetical calculation arising out of the rate support grant distribution formula. That determines how much is actually received, worked out on the basis of the needs element of the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when we are considering the possible application of the provisions under the clause, if the Secretary of State has told a local authority that he believes that its proposed aggregate of expenditure is excessive or unreasonable and gives his reasons for coming to that view, the local authority should then be free to draw to the Secretary of State's attention the fact that, while, it might appear to be spending more than many other authorities on account of the sparsity of the population, that is because its sparsity is particularly dramatic compared with any other authority. Sutherland district council, for example, which might have a sparser population than any other, might wish to draw that fact to the Secretary of State's attention. Although it will have been taken account of to some extent in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
RSG which the authority received through the needs-related criteria, it may still be a perfectly relevant consideration for the Secretary of State to bear in mind when deciding whether its expenditure comes within the criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the debate, but perhaps it would be helpful if the Minister, in writing to my hon Friend about a possible amendment, could give some information about the interpretation of " the area of " and whether the words are necessary in the first place. As this will be a matter of concern to many local authorities, instead of letting it be tested in the courts, can he say what he thinks the interpretation is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a relief it is, Mr. Gourlay, to see you back in the Chair. It was certainly intriguing to see the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) in the Chair. If I may say so, the mantle of impartiality suited him for the brief period that he was there. He did very well. He did not intervene and— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> As my hon Friend says, he did not mention Lothian regional council once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he moved the amendment, my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that he did not know whether it was a probing amendment and that he was not sure what the Minister was up to by putting the words "the area of" into the clause. Since then we have discovered that the Minister himself is not terribly sure why the words are there. Therefore, we have fertile ground for a first-class debate on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant to consider properly what the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of the authority"</p></blockquote>
could mean. Is the provision restricted to the area within the boundaries of a local authority or could it perhaps draw into the Secretary of State's consideration at the same time circumstances of the area outside the boundaries of that local authority? If it will give rise to wider consideration, it might be a useful phrase to leave in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I suspect that the real effect could be more restrictive. If we are to leave in the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area of the authority,"</p></blockquote>
we should put many other things in as well. We should also include the circumstances of the people or the industry of the authority or the circumstances of the housing and other services. The provision could give a Secretary of State, perhaps even the present Secretary of State, scope to discriminate between district councils within a certain regional council area. 1 am particularly concerned that, within the Lothian region, the Secretary of State might take advantage of any loopholes that we leave in the Bill to discriminate in favour of Edinburgh and against East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian. Therefore, I have a particular concern about the clause.

My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) referred to the Duke of Buccleuch and to his land going up and down.

It would be much more straightforward if we had only morning sittings. We would not then get as rusty as we are now, but I must not get into that debate, because you would rightly pull me up, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to discovering whether the Minister or my hon Friend has discovered whether this is a probing amendment and a relevant matter for discussion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a great relief to the Committee when I say that I do not think that the debate needs to go on for a long time now, although I accept entirely that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is right in thinking that it is a matter of significance and one which we shall want to look at again in the light of what has been said. 1 look forward to receiving a letter from the Minister which will throw light upon my mind and tell us what conclusions the Government have reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter which we must get right because it is a key part of the new provision. We shall not be able to debate this under the amendment, but no doubt later on we shall turn to such matters as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the financial and other relevant circumstances."</p></blockquote>
What the "other relevant circumstances" are is extremely relevant to the debate about the meaning of the word "area". Once we know what the "relevant circumstances" are, the meaning of the word "area" will be easier to come by. I do not want to tempt the Minister into writing a manual or guide to the clause, but when he is putting pen to paper—or instructing that typewriters be tapped—he could perhaps deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
the "other relevant circumstances", because it is all part of the package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman looks at the proceedings of the Committee on 29 January, he will see that at the bottom of column 210 I made some comment on the meaning of that phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone could find it for me it would help. Perhaps the Minister could help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave examples of "other relevant circumstances". They are by no means meant to be an exclusive list. I quote my own words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We could consider the extent of the area, the sparsity or density of the population, the incidence of urban deprivation, the number of clients for the major local authority circumstances such as education and social work, prospective oil development and so on. These are not, strictly speaking, financial circumstances but most would agree that they are relevant in coming to a judgment whether proposed expenditure is excessive and unreasonable."</p></blockquote>
Those are simply examples of circumstances that clearly would be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that intervention, because I had forgotten that passage. If the Minister says that that is illustrative but not definitive, it is of considerable help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the items are the "incidence of urban deprivation", the demographic factors referred to, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number of clients for the major local authority circumstances."</p></blockquote>
That is a strange phrase, if I may say so, but it has a certain quaint ring. Perhaps we should adopt it in our proceedings—
	<br><blockquote><p>"local authority circumstances such as education and social work."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 January 1981; c. 210-11.]</p></blockquote>
If those factors are to be taken into account, it seems to strengthen the case for taking out the words "the area of". One never knows what literal interpretations will be put on words later, but on first reading that would seem to rule out some examples which the Minister wisely put forward and which are reported in column 210.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My closing remark is to respond to the explanation the Minister gave. He did not hang his hat on it or try to suggest that it was complete in itself. He said that the 1966 Act already used these words. I do not have that Act with me this afternoon—aggravatingly, I had it this morning. There are no copies available to the Committee among the papers. For some reason, we seem to have run out of copies of the 1966 Act. The Minister read from it and I understood the passage to refer to the circumstances of the area concerned. With respect, the circumstances of "the area concerned" are rather different from the "area of the authority".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I wanted to refer to a local authority and its circumstances, I might use the word "areas" in the phrase "circumstances of the area concerned". That is a synonym for the local authority itself. I should use that form rather than "the circumstances of the local authority concerned." But to use "area" to qualify "authority" is a totally different grammatical circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
If the Minister is inhibited from removing the phrase by the parallel he attempted to draw with the phraseology from other parts of section 5, I think that if he were to sit down and consider and put himself back into the fifth form of school when one did grammatical parsing, he would see that the parallel was not a good one. There is a very clear distinction in every sense between the phrase about which we are complaining and the phrase the Minister read from the earlier passage in the Act—namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"circumstances of the area concerned."</p></blockquote>
I intend to withdraw the amendment. Apart from anything else, it would be discourteous to press it to a Division when the Minister has said that he will think about his position. However, the more I think about it on my feet as the argument has progressed, the more I am satisfied that it would make the Bill clearer. It would get nearer to broadening the concept in the way that the Minister has outlined. I believe that he should table the necessary amendment—perhaps not exactly on these lines, although I think that that is the simplest way of doing it—on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to:</i> No. 40, in page 7, line 3, after "State", insert 	<i>"(a)",—[Mr. Rifkind.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 7, line 6, leave out paragraph (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come on to a series of amendments which rightly are being taken separately because they refer to separate issues. However, they all relate to the same part of the Act—namely, the new subsection (1A) in section 5 of the 1966 Act. The Committee will remember —indeed it can hardly forget as this has been the subject of debate for the past few minutes—that subsection (1A) sets out the criteria which the Minister can take into account in deciding whether expenditure is excessive and unreasonable. These are additional to the circumstances of the "area of the authority", or the "circumstances of the authority"—whichever it ends up as—which we have just debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be coming to a number of arguments, some of which the Opposition feel extremely strongly about. The Minister will not be surprised to hear, for example, that when we reach the amendment which seeks to delete paragraph (c),
	<br><blockquote><p>' "to such other criteria as he considers appropriate.".',</p></blockquote>
we shall take the strongest exception to the wide and omnibus catch-as-catch-can nature of that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to which I must address my remarks is, of course, the amendment that would remove the criteria in paragraph (a), under which the Secretary of State must have regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the expenditure or estimated expenses, in that or any preceding year, of other local authorities which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, closely comparable (or as closely comparable as is practicable) with the local authority concerned."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph was drafted by a canny man. It is hedged about with caveats, qualifications and minor restrictions which, clearly, are intended to leave the Secretary of State with the widest possible discretion. The purpose
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
of the amendment is to try to discover exactly how this criterion may be operated. We must of course bear in mind that it may not be operated at all, because it is discretionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not matter how closely comparable one authority may be with another; if the Secretary of State wishes, for reasons best known to himself, to separate out one of them and to leave the other, it will not be possible to pray in aid the fact that another authority with exactly comparable estimated expenses and comparable financial circumstances is not being hit by the new provisions under section 5. But if we assume that the Secretary of State will exercise the criteria which he himself has built into the legislation, the Committee is owed a full explanation of exactly what the clause means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That request may seem almost redundant. On the face of it, there are no difficult words or obscure and opaque phrases that would test the patience of, say, a child sitting an O-level comprehension paper. But behind the apparent simplicities of the individual words there is a fairly complex sentence, and I think we are entitled to ask a number of questions about the exact operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 	<i>(a),</i> the Secretary of State may have regard
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the expenditure or estimated expenses, in that or any preceding year, of other local authorities."</p></blockquote>
First, I assume that there is no time limit on this provision. We may deal with some of these points on later amendments but, in passing, I will say that there is a case for limiting the comparison to current comparison. Possibly the estimated expenses for the coming year are the key relevant consideration, and preceding years have very little to do with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may recollect that amendment No. 31 deals specifically with " any preceding year". I would intend to comment on that matter at that stage, and the hon Gentleman may agree that it would be more appropriate to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it might be more appropriate to discuss that matter under amendment No. 31. I was trying to be helpful by indicating, as we go along, our feeling that it is the estimated expenditure for the year at threat which is most relevant. Rather than spoil the anticipated pleasure of the Minister as he contemplates the next amendment, I shall hurry on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"other local authorities which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of State"—</p></blockquote>
that is another phrase that we shall discuss on another amendment, so I shall hasten over it now—
	<br><blockquote><p>"closely comparable (or as closely comparable as is practicable) with the local authority concerned."</p></blockquote>
We want to know something about comparability. "Comparability" is a famous political word. It has been knocked around a great deal, but we are entitled to ask the Under-Secretary to say a word or two about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That also is the specific objective of another amendment before the Committee—amendment No. 33. We can take all the amendments together if the hon Gentleman wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I certainly do not want to take them all together. To do so would imply criticism of the Chair, and I could not possibly be guilty of that, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is happy to take all the amendments at the same time. Perhaps the hon Gentleman could indicate at this stage whether there are any amendments on which he will wish to divide the Committee. By "all the amendments" I mean all those up to amendments Nos. 34 and 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect, Mr. Gourlay, I think that it would be better to stay with your original selection. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> As my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) says—he is noted for his collection of couthie Scottish wisdom—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He comes from Durham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After all these years in Central Fife, he is now naturalised, he has become acclimatised. I think that he is right to say that we should go one step at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that 1 am in some difficulty, because many of the points will arise in subsequent debates but one point that will not arise is the key, the trigger sentence. If we cut out all these qualifications, these accretions of words which we hope will be removed or probed, examined and put under the microscope in debate on the amendments to come, we are left with the trigger words "closely comparable", to which the amendment refers. I think that we should ask the Minister to confine his remarks—I know that he will want to remain in order—to what is comparable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter, because the field is restricted. If, for example, we consider regional councils in Scotland, of which there are only nine, the term "comparable" does not spring immediately to mind. For example, the Highland region covers almost half the land mass of Scotland and has special problems. Surely it would not be unfair to suggest to the Minister that "comparable" is a totally meaningless term, if the Highland region, for example, is considered as a possible victim under the new provisions. On the other hand, I should not think that Strathclyde could be compared with any other region; it does not cover half the land mass but it has half the population. Clearly the considerations are totally different in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Borders are a small agricultural region. Some of us may consider it lucky to have survived as a region at all. I hope that I am not standing on anyone's toes at this point, but the Minister will recall the widespread surprise when the Wheatley committee report came up with that regional concept. It is very much a one-off region and could not be compared easily with any other unit in its peer group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is attributing that to Lord Wheatley when, in fact, the original Wheatley idea was that these smaller regions should not exist. The Borders region, for instance, came about as a result of decisions by the Heath Tory Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful to my hon Friend. I had forgotten that, in the same way, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
Government of the day jettisoned the estuarial concept when, rightly or wrongly, they created the separate Fife region. I know that Fife was strongly in favour of that. But the Borders region popped up. I wonder whether its birth was on a certain political basis, but that is an unworthy thought to impute to the Committee as a whole, and I take personal responsibility for introducing it into the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am making, at not, I hope, too unnecessary a length, is that, in the Highlands, Strathclyde and the Borders, we have a series of units within the regional structure where the term "comparable" becomes almost meaningless. Again, Central, for example, would rightly claim to have special circumstances. It is a small, compact, central, belt conglomerate, to use an analogy from the business world, and it is difficult to say that its problems are comparable to any other regional problems.

We are not dealing merely with the regional councils. I can see that if one took the districts it might be possible to find easier bases for comparison, but even they would show enormous discrepancies in their individual and particular circumstances. The small agricultural areas such as Wigton or the Stewartry have special problems as well as special advantages. The Stewartry, for example, has been singled out for criticism by the Controller of Audit for the high surpluses that it has accumulated as a percentage of its rateable income. We have only to look at the effect of local government grants, particularly housing support grants, on some of the Highland counties to see that they have special problems.

At the other end of the scale is Glasgow. It may be imagined that Glasgow could be compared with, for example, Edinburgh, because they are both city districts. However, they have totally different financial structures and totally different problems. The Edinburgh district has a remarkably high rateable value. It has an extremely good financial platform based upon its status as a capital city with many academic and commercial premises attracting high rateable values. Glasgow, perhaps unfortunately, has not had those advantages and benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to ask exactly what is the basis of the comparison to which the clause refers. Clearly that will be one of the key matters that the Secretary of State may consider. It is central to the discussion because paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> of new subsection (1 A) specifies "general economic conditions"—not, presumably, those within the local authorities, areas but those of the nation as a whole, the world, or whatever. The criterion that we are now discussing is the one criterion in this part of the Bill—I do not intend to refer back to what we were discussing earlier—that is specifically linked to local authorities as such. Therefore it is important to obtain a full explanation of how it is to be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to set some limits to such a serious power, and define its ambit of operation in some way. I make no objection to that general principle. If we are to have criteria at all, if we are to fetter the Secretary of State's discretion, comparability will probably have to stay. I say so rather diffidently, because there are many pitfalls, particularly when the voluntary principle is involved.

If I may refer to nineteenth century Scottish politics, Mr. Gourlay, the nation was once split on the voluntary principle and its implications. That was in the rather different sphere of mid-nineteenth century church politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Disruption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) mentions disruption. I do not think that the disruption and rage that will erupt at the application of the voluntary principle through this part of the Bill is likely to be quite so widespread or so fiercely sustained as it was then. For all that, it is important to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not necessarily hostile to the criterion. Comparability will inevitably be involved. However, we cannot simply throw it onto the table like a wet haddie and leave it lying there. The Minister owes us a good deal of information on exactly how the provision will operate. He should tell us by using practical examples. The Government may last another 18 months— who knows? Let us assume that it will. It is likely, then, that the Under-Secretary will continue to prop up the crumbling temple of the Scottish Office, beavering away in the interstices of the Scottish Development Department. He may have to operate the machinery in question before his furlough is out and he has to thowle his assize.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore not unreasonable to ask the Under-Secretary to illustrate how the principle will operate. Will he tell us, in terms of today, how he would make the comparison for the purposes of considering whether a local authority should be a victim? I understand that there would be no suggestion of his seriously considering action with regard to whatever example he picks, but will he talk us through and define by example how the criterion would operate in terms of, say, the expenditure for the preceding year of two regions or district councils? I am sure that he will have spent a great deal of time studying the machinery, so I do not consider my request unreasonable or difficult to honour. It would certainly help my hon Friends and myself to understand whether paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> should be retained in its present form, or at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to list the comparisons. Will he say precisely which authority compares with which? If the Government intend to exercise their discretion in this clause they must have given some forethought to which authority is compared with which authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I worked for the National Association of Local Government Officers, on a number of the collective agreements that we reached with the local authorities through the National Joint Council for Local Authority Staffs and through the Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials, the use of comparisons was fundamental to the collective agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all my experience I never got the councillors of one authority to agree with the councillors of another authority that there was a comparison. The Minister will have a great deal of difficulty in exercising his discretion when he becomes the Secretary of State for Scotland in the next century. If he attempts to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
effect to the clause he will have grave difficulties with each and every authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I said to local authorities, particularly one borough council in Fife, that they were comparable with others it was immediately rejected. If I argued that population was the criterion I was told that I should take some other factors into account. I was never able to establish the criteria with the local authorities. That was an area of considerable difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell us exactly what the criteria are. The Bill lays down
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other criteria as he considers appropriate,"</p></blockquote>
but I can only think of population or geographical factors. There must be others, but I have been through all this at least a hundred times all over Scotland, before and after the reorganisation, and the difficulty of persuading an authority that it was comparable with another was extremely difficult. It was easier to achieve that with the regions in some ways. But we have moved on. Whereas in the early days I could argue that Grampian region was comparable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I may have misled the Committee in allowing the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to go rather widely in moving the amendment. The point relating to comparability refers to amendment No. 33 and although I allowed the hon Member for Garscadden to do so, I do not intend to allow any further discussion on comparability while we are on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, of course, abide by your advice, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Are we not getting slightly mixed up? Does not the amendment you have just referred to delete only one of the "comparable" phrases? We are all in genuine difficulty here. I want to raise a point about what is " comparable " and I intended to do so strictly on the basis that it was in order and that the further amendment was only deleting one of the two references.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is correct, as the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) says, that the amendment only deletes the words " closely comparable ". However, knowing the members of the Committee, I cannot imagine them discussing those words in their strict sense. Therefore, I believe that it would be better to argue comparability on that amendment rather than on the amendment at present before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I await the Minister's remarks with great interest, because he will not have much to say when replying to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, little needs to be said from Opposition Members in support of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the position. Amendment No. 33 takes out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or as closely comparable as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
with the local authority concerned. But the words " closely comparable " in line 9 remain. The issue is, therefore, whether the paragraph stands in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
The argument is about the words " closely comparable ", ignoring the later amendment, which widens that phrase to
	<br><blockquote><p>"as closely comparable as is practicable."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon Members wish to pursue the matter of comparability in this amendment, amendment No. 33 will be very narrowly drawn indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that that has been clarified I want to come to my final point. I have made it before, but I am making it again at the end of my speech to give the Minister an opportunity to answer it. Have the Government decided which authorities are comparable with which—that is, is there a list which says whether Bearsden and Milngavie is comparable with Eastwood or whether the Grampian region is comparable with the Tayside region? Those are two districts and two regions. Is there a list covering all Scottish authorities so that tomorrow morning each authority will know how the comparison is to be carried out? How many authorities will there be? There may be one on either side, there may be half a dozen, or there may be groupings. Can we say " these 10 district councils are comparable" or " these three regions are comparable "? If that list exists, I hope that the Minister will read it to us now so that the authorities, and the Committee, will know where they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear, Mr. Gourlay, that I shall make only one point. I hope that it will be relevant; I shall not delve into the avenues of nineteenth century church politics, however tempted I may be to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because you wisely separated the amendments, Mr. Gourlay, I understand that we are not dealing with "preceding year", nor with the opinion of the Secretary of State, nor with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or as closely comparable as is practicable."</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with regard being had
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the expenditure or estimated expenses, in that … year, of other local authorities which are … closely comparable … with the local authority concerned."</p></blockquote>
I also understand that an exercise to determine the rate support grant is now being carried out by the Scottish Office. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that such an exercise is being undertaken at present in order to compare the regions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed what my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said. If an exercise of comparability is at present being undertaken, he is quite right. It is completely impossible to compare the Highland region with the Strathclyde region in respect of population, area, numbers of old people, and so on. My hon Friend could have added that in some regions— Stodart may, if it is accepted, change this—some of the functions carried out by districts in other regional authorities are actually carried out by the regions. For example, Border, Dumfries and Galloway carry out certain functions which are carried out by districts in other areas. Therefore, because of all the criteria that were mentioned earlier, I argue that there is no one region in Scotland which can be compared with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the best way of achieving comparability is to look at the provision of services within each
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
region, how far they go towards meeting the needs and, if you will forgive me for saying it once more, Mr. Gourlay, how far it goes towards fulfilling the statutory responsibilities. But thereby hangs yet another amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has shown that he accepts that, in view of the further amendments due to be considered, it would be appropriate to dwell with these at that time. I shall deal with the general significance of paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> and the particular reference to comparability which hon Gentlemen have declared to be their main interest at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first assure the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) that, so far as I know, no list has been drawn up in the Scottish Office that would provide a basis for deciding who was considered comparable to whom. I think that it would be inappropriate to contemplate such a thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly recognised that, if a Secretary of State is to decide whether estimated expenditure will be excessive or unreasonable, it is almost impossible to avoid some comparisons. The hon Gentleman agreed that that factor would almost inevitably be taken into account in determining whether that seemed a fair way to proceed. But on what basis might comparability proceed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members correctly pointed out that simply to assume that one region is comparable to another is a facile and superficial approach. To compare the Highland region with the Strathclyde region or the Edinburgh district with the Sutherland district would be a meaningless exercise if it were based merely on the fact that both were district or regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, some districts are comparable on any commonsense interpretation, either in terms of size or population or in terms of their needs, as the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) commented, or in terms of any other area of expenditure. Although we need not reach any definitive view at present, a particular district taken as a whole might be considered very similar to another district taken as a whole, or a region might be considered as similar to another region. I do not state that as a matter of categorical faith, but, in a relatively small country such as Scotland, there is clearly some basis for making comparisons. We all do so in the judgments we make, because we believe that an authority is either overspending or underspending. That is essentially a comparison between the way in which local authorities have responded to a recognised need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is not simply a facility for the Secretary of State but also a safeguard for the local authority. When the Secretary of State wants to act under these powers, the provisions ensure that he must make clear to the local authority and to Parliament the basis for his decision. If he feels that a comparison between an authority against whom he wishes to act and another is reasonable, he will have to state his reasons for so doing and show which areas of comparability he believes to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could either relate to the total expenditure of the authority against which he contemplates action compared with another comparable authority or it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
might relate not to the aggregate of expenditure but to the expenditure on a particular area of policy such as education, social work, roads or transport. It would be possible to make a comparison between one authority's expenditure in that respect and that of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, whichever criteria were applied would have to be disclosed to the local authority in question, which would then be able to challenge the assumptions on which the Secretary of State had come to the conclusion both in terms of the statutory procedure that is already provided for—by making direct representations to the Secretary of State—and because the Secretary of State in putting forward an order to Parliament for approval has to state his objectives and reasons, as well as the representations that he has received from the local authority if its conclusion differs from his. Therefore, although the Secretary of State certainly has an element of discretion, there is a safeguard for the local authority in that it will be aware of the assumptions that are taken on board when the Secretary of State proposes to act against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Secretary of State is forming his opinion and making his comparisons, does he intend to consult COSLA or any other body about the criteria?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be obliged to confer with the local authority against which he contemplates taking action. It is not a question of his discretion; the procedure requires that if the Secretary of State proposes to act against an authority he must not only indicate his intention to it but also give the reasons why he believes that its expenditure is excessive or unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he draws a conclusion based on a comparison with the expenditure of a similar named authority, or authorities, clearly he must provide his evidence, and the local authority concerned will have the opportunity to make the strongest possible representations to counter the claim. If the Secretary of State were still determined to go ahead and submitted an order to the House on the matter, he would have to give his reasons for coming to the view that the expenditure was excessive or unreasonable and would have to state why the local authority felt differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An appeal to the sheriff after that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, if anyone believes that statutory powers are being overruled or not properly acceded to there is always an inherent right for the matter to be determined in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the issue. Whatever view we may come to about the later amendments concerning the wording of the provision, the general question of comparability is inevitable. It is a safeguard for the local authority as well as a relevant factor that should be taken into account. I hope that the explanation
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
is helpful to the Committee and that it will agree that, without prejudice to any further amendments concerning the details of the subsection, it is sensible to have the provision as reflected by paragraph (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to deal with the point mentioned by the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East in respect of the other criteria that he considers appropriate. Clearly, he has appreciated that that does not come within the terms of the amendment and has therefore not felt it necessary to hear the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that some reference to comparability will almost certainly be involved in the Act. I do not feel that there is justification for pushing the matter to a Division at this stage. On the other hand, it is perhaps a little unfortunate that the later amendments covering specific passages could not have been taken first. We would then have known the final state, so to speak, of paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> when we came to consider whether it should remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what the Under-Secretary has said. One of the difficulties about the report that would be laid before Parliament—it would be a fascinating document —is that we have not been told its form and detail. I say, rather sorrowfully, that no doubt if it were in power my party would be as great a sinner as any other. Governments whip their supporters on such matters as this. However persuasive the objections that are made and referred to in the report from the local authority, I greatly fear that it would carry little weight when the Patronage Secretary's assistants are chasing after their flock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) seems to be giving some strange signal to me. May I remind him that, because of his Government's activities, this is an open-ended debate and there is no reason why we should have stopped at 7 o'clock. Indeed, he voted for that proposal. However, on this occasion I shall have mercy on the hon Gentleman; I do not intend to detain the Committee very long on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting forward a number of proposals and while we realise that they are narrow and that argument on them will have to be narrow, the one which deals with the extent to which it is practical to depart from comparability will perhaps allow some of my hon Friends to raise points that were not raised this evening for the convenience of both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that very much in mind, on the general principle that we feel that comparability must remain in some form in clause 13, and in the knowledge that we will raise the arguments another day, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
