	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [this day],</i> No. 128, in page 15, line 43, at end insert " unless it appears to the court that in all the circumstances of the case such a power is unnecessary".—[	<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was inviting the Committee to consider whether the saving phrase in the amendment should be added to clause 14(l)(a). I suggested that it would be a sensible and useful change to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that, the matrimonial interdict having been obtained,
	<br><q><p>"The court shall, on application of the applicant spouse, attach a power of arrest".</p></q>
That is a mandatory duty that falls upon the court, triggered by the application of the spouse who has obtained the interdict. The interesting distinction that is clearly and intentionally made in the clause is that there is no level of discretion open to the court in a matrimonial interdict attached to an exclusion order. Whereas in another form of matrimonial interdict—one that might deal with violent conduct, harassment and so on, but had been obtained, for example, during the course of other matrimonial proceedings—the court can at least listen to argument that in all the circumstances of the case such power is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be sensible for that flexibility to be given to the court in both cases. It is not a matter of disagreeing with the logic of the Bill. I do not understand the basis of the distinction that has been made. Surely, both interdicts could have dealt with similar conduct. It would be distressing no doubt, and many cases would justify the attachment of a power of arrest. A husband—if it is a husband— might find it difficult to convince the court that, in all the circumstances, the power was unnecessary. But I believe that the loophole should be allowed so that the subject of an interdict can make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of arrest is obviously a serious matter. It can be a considerable sword of Damocles, and should be used only in extreme circumstances. But, before it is imposed, there should be open to argu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
ment whether, in the circumstances, it is necessary. Therefore, to put it simply, I should like to see that spread to both paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b).</i> I am encouraged in my view because it appears from clause 14 as a whole that there is no real distinction to be drawn in the way that it has been drawn on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be more reassured if the matrimonial interdict were inevitably part of the process of the granting of an exclusion order. My right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craighton (Mr. Millan), during consideration of principle, said that as far as the Opposition can see—we are open to correction—it might be a staged process where the applicant spouse perhaps obtained an exclusion order and a matrimonial interdict at the same time, but at a later stage decided to make an application for a power of arrest. The judge or sheriff hearing the clause 14 application might not be the judge who presided at the earlier motion for the exclusion order and interdict. If one assumes that there is that staged process—the gap between obtaining the order and interdict and the attachment of the power of arrest—it is important not simply to have a mandatory duty to attach that power of arrest, but to have the safeguard in paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> applying to paragraph 	<i>(a).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—who, I am sure, stands by us loyally—has no doubt read the remarks of Women's Aid. That organisation has strongly opposing views, and calls for the omission of the proviso allowing a non-applicant spouse to make submissions about whether the power of arrest is necessary. The Women's Aid organisation would like to take that proviso from paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> My amendment seeks to add it to paragraph 	<i>(a)</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past I have found the submissions of Women's Aid very useful and, on many occasions, very persuasive. However, on that point I have had to disagree with the organisation. I prefer the logic of the argument which I have advanced. I hope that that argument finds some favour with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I comment on the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to discuss a point that he raised earlier about whether the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act constituted an interim provision. I do not intend to spend too long on the matter, but, if the hon. Gentleman consults 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that in a debate last year I emphasised
	<br><q><p>"that they are interim proposals, pending the final conclusion of the Scottish Law Commission".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 June 1980; Vol. 986, c. 745.]</p></q>
I believe that the point was made clear at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to the amendments to Clause 14, which are before the Committee. The views of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), are—as he has acknowledged—at variance with those of Women's Aid. He may not realise that they are also at variance with the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission. Examination of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
reasons advanced by the Commission show the strength of the Bill in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is a considerable distinction between matrimonial interdicts, which are ancillary to an exclusion order, and other matrimonial interdicts. A matrimonial interdict may be granted for a number of reasons, which include the possibility of violence causing physical or mental injury to the applicant or to the children of the marriage. Such an interdict may, however, be granted for far less serious reasons. The husband may be creating a nuisance. He may be interfering with his spouses's occupancy rights. There may be a number of factors, which do not pose any serious danger of physical or mental injury to the applicant spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When granting an interdict as an ancillary to an exclusion order, the court must be satisfied—in terms stated in the appropriate clause of the Bill—that there is a risk of physical or mental injury to the health of the applicant or of any of the children of the marriage. That distinction must be made, because we are discussing circumstances in which there is a definite risk of physical or mental injury. It is therefore of supreme importance that, once an exclusion order has been granted, all necessary action should be taken to ensure that that order is observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been recognised by the Law Commission, Women's Aid and other bodies, one of the main problems in the matrimonial sphere is that, even when an interdict has been granted, the husband— through his natural disposition, the influence of alcohol or other causes—may seek to breach the terms of the interdict and of the exclusion order. Therefore, it is essential that all that is possible should be done to prevent his doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a wife is under threat because of her husband's inclination to take such action, the police are—in most circumstances—the only body to which she can apply for help. In paragraph 4.33 of the Law Commission's report, reference is made to the views of the domestic violence working party, and it quotes the working party's remarks:
	<br><q><p>"They also emphasised strongly that the involvement of the police in the process of enforcing matrimonial interdicts was necessary in itself. The police were the only agency upon which a wife could call at any time of the day or night, and the prospect of their intervention was calculated to have a deterrent effect."</p></q>
It was for such reasons that the Law Commission went on to express the view that a discretion in the courts would be sufficient only where normal matrimonial interdicts were concerned. If the court were satisfied that an exclusion order was justified, because there was a danger of physical or mental injury to the health of the applicant spouse, the right of arrest should automatically follow. If there is an alleged breach of an interdict and exclusion order, it is for the police officer in question to decide whether to use that right, but it seems appropriate that the power should be provided in these circumstances. Otherwise the important rights given to the spouse by the Bill might have much less significance in practice than they are intended to have. I have no doubt that it was for such reasons that the Law
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
Commission put forward recommendations in line with the current form of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Law Commission is a persuasive authority but I do not think that its views are conclusive. But my views are not conclusive either, and I am certainly realistic enough to know that I cannot enforce them upon the Committee. I am not entirely sure that the logic is on the side of the Minister on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that most matrimonial interdicts which are the subject of paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> will involve conduct which is not very different from the broad concept of unreasonable behaviour which constitutes the criteria in clause 4. Particularly since the vast majority of these power of arrest applications will presumably be made at the same time as the exclusion order and matrimonial interdict is promulgated, I would have thought there there was no great harm in allowing a non-applicant spouse, who may well be represented, to make his representations to the court about the circumstances if he so wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, I believe that a little flexibility is no bad thing. I would not like to be in a situation in which a judge might well suspect that it is not necessary to make the grant but since he is tied hand and foot, metaphorically speaking, he has no option but to do so. However, if the Minister is not prepared to listen to these arguments, and if the Law Commission is to hold sway, I had better retreat from the fight, at least temporarily. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan (West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 16, line 3, leave out from " court" to end of line 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears to me that if the legislation on matrimonial interdicts that we are setting up is to be successful, they should be enforceable in some way. I find it very difficult to see how the matrimonial interdict can be enforced unless a power of arrest is attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will some other sanction be open to a police officer for example, who may be called to a house and finds that the spouse who is the subject of the interdict has broken the interdict by appearing in the house or in the area of the house, or is, perhaps, treating the other spouse and the children in such a way that there is clear evidence that he is breaking the interdict? What advice would the Minister give to the wife or the husband, as the case may be, or to the police officer in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill goes through as it stands, it will be open to the spouse to go to the court and plead that the power of arrest should not be attached to the matrimonial interdict. There are only two possibilities: either the spouse making the plea to the court intends to break the interdict, or he does not intend to do so, in which case he or she ought to have nothing to fear from the power of arrest being attached. If he or she intends to break the interdict, it will be necessary to make it enforceable,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
otherwise it will merely be a statement on paper, which cannot be enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome the Minister's reply to those points. I particularly wish to know the advice that he would give if there were clear evidence of an interdict being broken, where no power of arrest was attached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am fascinated by the split which has developed on what appears to be the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar), true to his views on civil liberties, wishes to reduce the power of summary arrest by the police. However, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who in the past has sought to imply that he was also a staunch believer in civil liberties, has, on this occasion, called for increased police powers and powers of arrest against ordinary members of the public who may have done no more than telephone their wives in breach of an interdict. In effect, that is what a matrimonial interdict, which is not attached to an exclusion order, may forbid them to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interdict can be granted in many different circumstances. Its power might be limited to ensuring that a husband does not bother his wife by telephoning her. With his well-known attachment to police powers in those matters, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire wishes to give the summary powers of arrest to a police officer to enforce the interdict in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, despite our known support for law and order, we cannot go as far as the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire in this matter, I can reassure him that, in certain circumstances, that renegade husbands may still be arrested, because the court has the discretion to allow a power of arrest. In its present form, the clause does not make it mandatory for the court to insist that that poor miscreant be arrested if he breaches the terms of the interdict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire asked what remedy the wife would have if the interdict had been breached and there were no power of arrest. She would have the remedy that she has at present. If there were a breach of an interdict which did not have a power of arrest attached, the wife, or whoever had been granted the interdict, could go back to the court and say " Look, this is the interdict that you granted. My husband has broken its terms." The husband could then be required to appear in court to explain what had happened, and would risk being held to be in contempt of court, or all kinds of serious matters could flow if he were not able to give the court a satisfactory explanation of why he apparently broke the terms of the interdict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of arrest would be needed when there was a threat of physical injury to the spouse, if the conduct complained of was not immediately stopped. In those circumstances, a police power of arrest could be considered appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary knows better than I that it could be a considerable time before a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
case was heard in court. If one spouse found that he or she were being pestered by the other, and no power of arrest was attached to the matrimonial interdict, what could he or she do? Would they have to wait, possibly for weeks, before the case was taken to court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that, as at present, if there were an alleged breach of interdict, the matter would normally be heard by the court very quickly. It could be heard the following day, or within a couple of days, if there were the slightest suggestion that the spouse was in danger as a result of the possible actions of the husband, or any other party against whom an interdict had been granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that, at the moment, whenever interdicts are granted, no power of arrest is normally attached. We are saying that if an exclusion order has been granted, or if the court thinks it appropriate, it can grant such a power. However, it should at least have the discretion not to do so if the reason for the interdict does not involve any question of physical injury to the spouse, but simply arises of of nuisance or other factors that are no real threat to her physical or mental health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I assure him that there is no truth in the rumour that I am seeking sponsorship from the Police Federation. In view of the explanation that the Minister has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, which I intended as a probing amendment in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 16, line 12, leave out "may" and insert " shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment sits rather ill with amendment No. 128, but there is a logical explanation for that. The previous amendment, which dealt with whether a power of arrest should be attached automatically is perfectly consistent with saying that, once that has been attached, certain things should follow. The system should take the matter very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to keep it a surprise in the last few lines, and I do not intend to insist on the amendment, in which I can see a number of difficulties. I tabled it, however, because it allows us to refer—perfectly competently—to an issue that the Minister has mentioned more than once in committee. That is the attitude of the police to domestic violence, in situations when they are invited to become involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is something about which women's movements and many legal bodies and individual petitioners feel very strongly. We can construct complicated machinery to enforce an interdict or to try to protect a battered spouse—we are doing well in the complications as we forge into the procedure following arrest, in clause 15. But even with our best efforts, all that we say in Committee is but a gesture and means little for those who have to endure such situations and cope with domestic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
violence, if there is not good will on the part of the police and a genuine determination to make the legislation workable. The whole point of the amendment is to draw attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to say something about guidance that he may or may not feel able to give to chief constables. I think that, an advocate, he will be aware—although perhaps he has not grubbed about in the lower storeys of the legal system, as I have—of the problems that can arise. I have some sympathy with policemen when they are called out, perhaps in the middle of the night, to a tearful scene in a house—an allegation that there has been an assault on the wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are difficulties and that experience can sometimes be a hard master in such matters. For example, there is no doubt that, when arrest has taken place—perhaps after the interdict and at the point of a criminal charge—there has often been a reconciliation in the interim. On more than one occasion, I had the job of breaking such news to the procurator fiscal on the morning of a trial, when the matter had reached that point, with all the attendant expenses and trouble. I would tell him "You might as well drop it, because my client's wife is not going to go into the box." The wife can, of course, be compelled to go into the box, but she cannot be compelled to repeat what she told the police originally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fairly high failure rate when the corn-plainer—clearly a key witness—" fails to trap " bv her evidence, to put it in the colloquial language of Glasgow sheriff court. I know that the police feel strongly that they must be very sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also genuine difficulties about corroboration that are not always appreciated by members of the public. Perhaps we shall discuss corroboration later, in the context of interdicts and prosecutions of this kind. The law at present states that there must be the full corroboration demanded by the criminal law of Scotland. Although it may be as plain as a pikestaff—or a black eye or a bloody nose—that an assault of some sort has taken place, the policeman may feel geneuinely and justifiably that he dees not have the prima facie case that would allow proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made those provisions, and recognised the genuine difficulties faced by the police, I think that there is a traditional reluctance on their part to be involved in matrimonial cases. That can sometimes amount to a protective chauvinism in some members of the force. I think that that is a major problem. It does not matter how many interdicts are lodged with chief constables, or how many eloquent speeches are made by the Under-Secretary in Committee, unless we make an effort to persuade the police to look seriously at the matter. Otherwise, all that we do will be in vain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made one or two passing references to the problems, I should be interested to hear—we shall be debating the procedure later— exactly what, if anything, he intends to say to the police, and whether he has any plans to try to acclimatise them to the rather novel procedure. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
may involve checking an interdict that has been lodged, and acting upon it. Presumably, they would not necessarily act on the ground that there is prime facie a criminal charge, with its heavy onus of proof to be discharged, but in situations where the balance of probabilities is that there are grounds for a successful action for breach of interdict. An arrest may be justified in those circumstances, even if the situation falls short of that founding a successful prosecution for assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Policemen are conditioned to think in terms of criminal prosecutions. The lower standard of proof— the idea of the interdict being their -srasiness—may come strange to many of them, and that is understandable. I think that there is a major job to be done in talking to the hierarchy, and perhaps in ensuring that the Act is within the consciousness of the young policeman coming through his training at Tullialan police college. There should be an attempt to get the message across to the individual policeman on the beat, at local level, so that he is prepared to look with at least a sympathetic eye at the possibility of using this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, if the man is removed from the house under arrest and there is a power of arrest attached and a prima facie breach of interdict there are other stages—we shall come to those later—where he can be released, either by a senior officer or, ultimately, by the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is a major one, of which I am sure the Minister is well aware. I have no doubt that he has addressed his mind to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was relieved to hear the hon. Gentleman immediately disassociate himself in his opening remarks from the amendment. Any alternative explanation would have been rather inconsistent with his previous statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only normal to give a power of arrest in permissive terms rather than mandatory terms but also very sensible. Although there may have been a breach of interdict involving an exclusion, the nature of the breach might be so minimal that it would be absurd to require a constable to use his power of arrest, irrespective of the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has asked me to comment on the extent to which it would be appropriate or desirable to give guidance to police officers as to how they should use the powers that are available in the Bill. At present, a police officer who is called to the scene of a matrimonial conflict and sees that there is a possibility of physical injury to the wife is only entitled to use a power of arrest if he sees that a crime has been committed, or that there is a likelihood of a criminal offence being committed. The major change initiated by the clause is that that right to arrest would apply not only where there is the possibility of a criminal offence being committed, but where the officer was satisfied that there had been a breach of the exclusion order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a large extent, it will be a matter of judgment whether the breach is serious or trivial. It it were trivial, a sensible police officer would not normally wish to exercise the right of arrest. Surely, the most important consideration for him to bear in mind

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
is whether an arrest is appropriate to safeguard the spouse or the children of the marriage from injury, given that that is the main reason for the power of arrest being provided.

Any formal guidance that the Government might wish to give the police is a matter jointly for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate who both have responsibilities in this regard and would wish to be consulted. I should not exclude the possibility of their specific guidance being given to the police. I am sure that some form of guidance would be appropriate, but at this stage it would be premature to decide on the exact form that the guidance should take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his acceptance that some form of guidance is probably necessary and desirable. I take that as a recognition that there is a genuine problem here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said very concisely and accurately, there will have to be a general change in the police approach when they are considering an interdict, given the rather tight definitions under criminal law to which they are used to working. I am glad that the Minister recognises that. It would not be fair of me to press him too much today on the nature of the guidance. It might be possible for him to expand his answer later, perhaps on Report or in reply to a written question, a letter or some other method. I am sure that members of the Committee who are genuinely interested to see how the legislation will work will be anxious for fairly definite advice to be issued to the police and will be interested to see the form which it is to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to what I take to be an assurance that the matter is under active consideration and that the Minister is seized of the problems. It is with some relief that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 17, line 5, leave out sub-paragraph (ii).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers a small point which is, perhaps, a matter of curiosity. The Committee will recall that the clause provides that if a person has been arrested for part breach of the interdict under section 14(3) and is taken to a police station, he may be liberated—to which I have no objection— or there may be a refusal to liberate him. If there is such a refusal there shall be no claim against the officer as a result of the appearance in court of the non-applicant spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand the necessity for that provision in the rather unusual procedures under clause 15, but I do not understand why we need subparagraph (ii) if the person is arrested at the spot and normal criminal procedures are carried out—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
in other words, if the procurator fiscal does not exercise his discretion to put no proceedings on it thereby ending a prosecution and leaving open the question of whether ultimately there will be proceedings for breach of interdict—I do not understand why we should not simply treat them as other criminal proceedings and not have written in this special safeguard referring to the 1975 Act. I do not know whether it is a change—which I doubt; if not, it seems redundant. Perhaps the Minister will explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to clause 15, and the procedure following arrest. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the provisions of clause 15(1), which states:
	<br><q><p>"Where a person has been arrested under section 14(3) of this Act the officer in charge of a police station may—
	<ol>
	<li>if satisfied that there is no likelihood of violence to the applicant spouse or any child of the family liberate that person unconditionally; or</li>
	<li>refuse to liberate that person; and such refusal and the detention of that person until his or her appearance in court by virtue of—
	<ol>
	<li>section 15(4) of this Act; or</li>
	<li>any provision of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975,</li></ol>
shall not subject the officer to any claim whatsoever."</li></ol></p></q>
The amendment questions the necessity for reference to the 1975 Act. But although a person may have been arrested for breach of the interdict, the decision to detain him in the police station may have been taken under the Act, rather than following the reason for his arrest. The proposal makes it clear that, even if the detention following the arrest is made not under clause 15 but under the 1975 Act, it is appropriate that the officer concerned should not be subject to any claim. There is no reason for the rights of the parties involved to be any different, dependent on the legislative basis for the detention. It is on that basis that reference to the Act is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made heavy weather of the amendment in my opening remarks; I apologise to the Committee. However, there is one point which I do not entirely understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that a police officer has made an arrest. It is probably not altogether clear on what grounds the arrest was made; the officer may have believed that he was making the arrest for breach of an interdict, or he may not have been sure why he was doing so. However, he takes the husband— for the sake of argument—to the police station, and makes a report. The procurator fiscal then decides to proceed, in the opinion that there is a clear case for an assault charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man goes to court and is found not guilty. In an unusual circumstance, the wife is found guilty of malicious allegations against him which were not properly investigated by the police. The man has spent time in custody, and having been found not guilty he raises an action of damages for wrongful arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subparagraph (ii), immunity is given to the policeman concerned. If an interdict had not been involved—if there had merely been a barney in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
house before the Act came into effect, the policeman had gone there and made the arrest and the same events had followed—the policeman would not have had the same statutory protection. Such an action might have little chance of success, but success would be at least technically possible. I am rather worried about the double standard introduced by clause 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that the original arrest was for breach of an interdict, and that it is decided to pursue the matter not on the basis of possible charge for breach of interdict or exclusion order but for breach of the peace. That would be another criminal matter, arising from the same circumstances but not actually connected to the original reason for the arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the police were to release the man and then immediately re-arrest him, intending to bring a charge based on a different matter, there would be a danger that the protection would not apply. It applies only for a limited period, in respect of
	<br><q><p>"refusal and the detention of that person until his or her appearance in court".</p></q>
If the appearance in court relates to a different criminal matter from that which prompted the original arrest, the protection will not apply unless an absurd position is created. The police must say: " You were arrested for breach of exclusion order, but we shall bring proceedings on the basis of breach of the peace. Therefore, I now release you in respect of the original cause of your arrest. However, I shall immediately re-arrest you because it has been decided to charge you with breach of the peace " —or with some other criminal matter. It would be absurd to require the police to go through that procedure. However, but for the provision in clause 15 it might be necessary, and it is to such circumstances that the provision is intended to apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen Adams	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that to grant immunity is a disincentive to good policing? The policeman can proceed, and his discretion will rest; there is no comeback whatsoever. That is a very dangerous practice. A policeman might be biased when faced with a domestic problem; he may know the wife, the husband, the area or the background. He is a human being, and will presumably exercise his judgment as a human being. It could be a sound judgment, but it could be a malicious one, human beings being what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the clause seeks to provide a disincentive to policemen to exercise their judgment sensibly in a situation which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, is often a very difficult one to deal with at 3, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. We are giving a policeman the power to walk into a home and take any action within the law that he sees fit, knowing that there is no come-back whatever. I urge the Minister to fling this provision in the bin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be prepared to fling it in the bin if the hon. Gentleman's suggestions were directed at what was in the Bill. However, I am afraid that he is under a misapprehension. I shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
try to enlighten him, though I cannot guarantee that I shall be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is concerned that the power of arrest might be wrongly exercised, and, therefore, that it is wrong to give specific immunity to a policeman who may have wrongly arrested a member of the public. If he will look at the provision, if he has a copy of the Bill available—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might explain a lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have committed it to memory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Gentleman has committed it to memory, he may now wish to refresh his memory. Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> states that that part of the clause which does
	<br><q><p>"not subject the officer to any claim whatsoever "</p></q>
does not refer to the initial arrest which may have taken place, but to a decision, once a person has been arrested and brought to the police station, not to release him because he will be appearing in court in the near future. That is a normal provision. It is not new, or peculiar to the Bill, but a normal circumstance which provides that a policeman acting in the course of his duty should not be subject to civil claims in that respect. We are not dealing with the original power of arrest, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not part and parcel of the same process? The policeman is not granted immunity on the charge, but on the decision to release or not to release, which relates to the original charge. How can the hon. Gentleman divide the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is normal for a police officer, who has acted in good faith and exercised certain powers that Parliament has given him, not to be subject to a civil claim simply because a person is aggrieved at the exercise of his judgment. It is different if one can show that the police officer acted in bad faith, or through malice, criminal intent or for some other totally unacceptable reason, misused or abused his powers. Then there are powers to bring an action for wrongful arrest or any other wrongful action which a police officer may have committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not with where there has been bad faith but with where a member of the public might disagree with the exercise of a policeman's judgment, which may have been exercised in good faith at the time. The safeguard that has been introduced here is the same as elsewhere and concerns a policeman who has acted in good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, I am happy to leave the matter there. However, I am not sure that the Minister is absolutely right, because he talks about bad faith and good faith on any claim whatever. No limitation is placed upon it. I shall reread this provision carefully, as it may be that I am getting addled at the end of a long day. However, it seems that there is a danger that, in the very unlikely circumstances of a policeman acting with malice— in cahoots with the applicant spouse—he would have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
a level of protection under the clause against any claim whatever. It seems that he would not have the same level of protection if—nothing to do with the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill—he merely calls to the house and arrests the other spouse for a potential breach of the peace or potential assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me a little is that two standards might be written in here. Perhaps the Minister will also look at this, because I think that my point is a fair one. I cannot see the words in statutory form which would justify the distinction that he is making between good faith and malice. I suspect that blanket protection may be given to a policeman acting under the umbrella of the Matrimonial Homes (Scotland) Act as the Bill will be when enacted, in a case which results in a criminal prosecution, when if he merely made the arrest per se without bothering about the interdict or anything else, he would have not put policemen at risk, but that seems to be a minor anomaly which the Minister could perhaps look at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's concern is that this is a form of words that has not been used elsewhere, I shall check to see whether that is so. It is certainly not intended that any police officer should have greater immunity than would normally apply when a police officer is acting in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot at the moment give specific chapter and verse as to whether this wording has been used elsewhere, but we can check that point. Certainly the intention is that, when a police officer has been acting in good faith, he should not be subject to any claim whatsoever, as is normal in these circumstances. However, we shall check the wording to ensure that it has the desired effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to leave the matter on that basis. The Minister and I are on all fours, metaphorically speaking. If the intention of the clause is that police officers should have no greater protection than they have in other circumstances, I am totally satisfied. My plaint is that I am not sure that that is the effect of the words in the provision, but I have no doubt that the Minister's skilled advisers will either substantiate that suspicion or rule it out. Either way, I am happy to leave the matter with him nominally and with them in fact. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments form one scheme in my attempt to alter the proposed system. They take us to an important although rather technical matter—the procedure that may follow an arrest. I am very anxious that this procedure should work well, as the Committee will have gathered. I am also a little worried about the strange hybrid system which has been ingeniously evolved by the draftsmen, or by those who instruct them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a situation in which there are no criminal proceedings. The procurator fiscal, having looked at the matter, decides that he wants to take it no further. I draw the Committee's attention to clause 15(6), which states that in those circumstances the procurator fiscal is to
	<br><q><p>"take all reasonable steps to intimate—
	<ol>
	<li>to the applicant spouse; and</li>
	<li>to the solicitor who acted for that spouse when the interdict was granted or to any other solicitor who the procurator fiscal has reason to believe acts for the time being for that spouse,</li></ol>
that the criminal proceedings referred to in subsection (1) above will not be taken."</p></q>
When the arrested man appears on the first lawful day, the fiscal has to appear in court and present a petition containing
	<br><q><p>"(i) a statement of the particulars of the non-applicant spouse;
	<ol>
	<li>a statement of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest; and</li>
	<li>a request that the non-applicant spouse be detained for a further period not exceeding 2 days".</li></ol></p></q>
If it appears to the sheriff at that point that
	<br><q><p>"proceedings for breach of interdict will be taken "</p></q>
and that
	<br><q><p>"there is a substantial risk of violence",</p></q>
he will detain the applicant spouse for the further period not exceeding two days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the system proposed in the Bill. My objection to it is simply that it is a strange amalgam of criminal and civil practice. The procurator fiscal is being invited to appear and make an application on behalf of the applicant spouse, who holds the interdict, asking that the man be committed to prison for a period to allow civil proceedings to commence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be a novel duty for the fiscal, although I think that it may not be entirely without precedent. There may be precedents that I have not thought of. I know that the fiscal very occasionally becomes involved in civil matters. For example, a fiscal dealt with education cases for the local authority, acting for it even though that was a prosecution of a sort. But I think that any such adventures are probably unhappy ones. I take the view that it would not be a good precedent for the fiscal to become involved in civil cases. Making an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
application on behalf of a client—the applicant spouse—from whom he has no instructions and with whom he may have no contact, is an activity that is foreign to the fiscal. He must make an intimation, although there does not need to be a response to it. There is an invitation, presumably made to the fiscal, to make some assumptions about the best interests of that applicant spouse and to act accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further down the line—I am sorry that this is so complicated—we are inviting the sheriff, again without the applicant spouse or his or her representative appearing or saying anything, to make an assumption about whether proceedings will be taken. There does not seem to be any specific duty to appear and there is not even a right written into the Bill, so far as I can see, to appear in such an action. Under subsection 	<i>(b)(i)</i> he is invited to make that assumption in a vacuum and apply the test of the substantial risk of violence, which must be something that only the applicant spouse can tell him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the procurator fiscal is going to present that petition and he has, as I have said, no instructions or, necessarily, contact with the " client "—the applicant spouse—that places a totally unreasonable burden on the sheriff in asking him to make up his mind whether or not holding the non-applicant spouse in custody is justified. I do not like the theory of giving the job to the fiscal and I do not really like the practicalities of the matter, either. I think that we are asking the sheriff to meet an unreasonable requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of such difficulties amendments Nos. 131 to 136 are on the amendment paper as an attempt to produce an alternative system. That may not produce a satisfactory answer and there may be many difficulties, but let me explain exactly what is afoot and then perhaps the Committee—or those hon. Members who have followed the matter—may want to pass judgment. Certainly the Minister will want to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am suggesting that, when the fiscal has taken his decision against proceedings he should make an intimation to the applicant, or to his or her solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that the wording of subsection (6)(a)
	<br><q><p>"to the applicant spouse "</p></q>
and of subsection (6)(b)
	<br><q><p>"to the solicitor who acted for that spouse when the interdict was granted or to any other solicitor who the procurator fiscal has reason to believe acts for the time being for that spouse"</p></q>
is extremely long. That may be justifiable in regard to thoroughness but a simple intimation to the applicant spouse or his or her solicitor would have been sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an intimation should be not only that no criminal proceedings are being taken but that the non-applicant spouse will be appearing in court at a certain time and place, under subsection (4). In that situation the applicant, or his or her solicitor, knows that the other party to the marriage—who is allegedly in breach of interdict—is not being pro
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
ceeded against and will turn up in a certain sheriff court, from custody, at a certain time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that point, I suggest that the procurator fiscal should present to the court a petition containing a statement of the particulars of the applicant spouse and a statement of the facts and circumstances that gave rise to the arrest. I think that it is reasonable that he should provide facts. However, I should like taken out the duty placed on the fiscal to take the decision as to whether it is right that an application for a further two days in custody should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that those words should come out. Once the facts are made clear, which the fiscal can do because he has the police report and he can report the circumstances as he sees them, we then leave it up to the sheriff to take a decision, but a decision that means further arrest only if he has a motion before him, not from the fiscal, but from the applicant spouse or a solicitor acting on his or her behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the applicant spouse is represented and makes an application for committal for a further two days to allow interdict breach action to be taken, the sheriff will not be blundering around trying to form a judgment about what is in the applicant spouse's mind without having any information on the point. The applicant spouse or his solicitor will be there and will be able to say whether he wants that committal and whether he intends to go ahead and make an application to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, clause 15(7)	<i>(b)</i>(i) can simply be taken out—that is the purpose of amendment No. 135—and replaced with the test that
	<br><q><p>"there is a prima facie case of breach of interdict on the basis of the facts and circumstances reported to him."</p></q>
We also add
	<br><q><p>"on the motion of the applicant spouse or a solicitor acting on his or her behalf".</p></q>
Therefore this is what will happen—intimation to the applicant spouse or the solicitor, the appearance in court, the narrating of the facts of the arrest by the solicitor but nothing else from the fiscal and then, if there is to be a motion for further committal, it comes from the applicant spouse or his solicitor, who is in a position to say whether he intends to raise action for breach of interdict. The only other test that the sheriff needs to apply is the one that survives after this cutting and chopping and changing—the substantial risk of violence test. I have also suggested a new one—that there is a prima facie case of breach of interdict on the basis of the facts and circumstances related by the fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that on the face of it the amendment is open to the attack that it is unreasonable to expect the spouse to make the motion and to turn up at short notice or to get his or her solicitor there. Normally I am a great one for allowing reasonable time for preparation where possible and for ensuring that no one is prejudiced by speed, but in this case speed is of the essence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are assuming that, even under the present machinery, the interdict action will have to be in the sheriff court or the Court of Session within 48 hours—that is the extent of the period of arrest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
which can follow under the machinery in clause 15(7)—it is not unreasonable to expect immediate recourse to a solicitor to trigger off this action and put it in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a spouse has been arrested for breach of interdict, it is not unreasonable that he should be told when he has to come to court. Given that the non-applicant spouse wants to proceed for breach of interdict, it is not unreasonable that they should go and get a solicitor, with whom they were almost certainly in touch in the original interdictory proceedings in any event, and get him into court to make the necessary application, if they are satisfied that a further period of custody is absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is a matter of balance. I have no doubt that there are strong arguments either way, but I hope that I have said enough. I am sorry that it has been so complicated, but it is a difficult subject. There are attractions in the alternative scheme that I have suggested to the Minister. It certainly keeps the fiscal—I mean this in the nicest sense—in his proper place and saves him doing a little bit of telepathy when deciding whether there ought to be an application, and it saves the sheriff from a similar exercise in deciding whether actions for proceedings for breach of interdict will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It ensures that the matter goes ahead only if the applicant spouse feels strongly enough about it to appear and make the motion or be represented for that purpose. I believe that on the whole it is a better and tidier solution to what will inevitably be a difficult and complicated procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are united in wanting to make the procedure work, but I should be interested to hear whether the Minister sees any virtue in this attempt to change the basis, but not the aims, of these procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by reassuring the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Adams), who raised the point about police arrest and not being subject to any claim whatsoever, that a similar provision exists in section 7(2)(c) of the Bail etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. He may like to consider that as ample precedent for this phraseology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments put down by the hon. Member for Garscadden. First, I compliment him on the extent to which he has given thought to this issue and put forward alternative proposals. I freely concede that when we drafted this legislation we found this one of the most difficult parts of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is right to point to the fact that it contains a somewhat unusual combination of powers and responsibilities. We faced great difficulty in seeking to ensure a procedure that was both fair to the wife and fair to the husband, who might be the person subject to detention as a consequence of these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was also right that the major weakness in his alternative proposals is that they involve an assumption that a wife and her solicitor
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
could respond in an extremely short time, or else lose the protection provided by this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal first specifically with the details of the hon. Gentleman's amendments. In particular, he took exception in amendment No. 131 to the use of the requirement that the intimation should be both
	<br><q><p>"to the applicant spouse; and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>to the solicitor who acted for that spouse when the interdict was granted or to any other solicitor who the procurator fiscal has reason to believe acts for the time being for that spouse".</p></q>
This provision is intended to deal with the case where the original solicitor may have retired, resigned, died or in some other way been changed. It seems highly desirable that, if intimation is to be made, where it is not unreasonable it should be made to the solicitor who is dealing with the matter at the appropriate time and who can therefore give the earliest advice to the spouse in this form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of detail, but let us assume that the applicant spouse is not available —she may have moved out, because of the trauma of the night, to stay with relatives—and that the interdict is granted by a solicitor who, when contacted, says, " We no longer act for her. We had a quarrel with her", or, " She went away, and we do not know who acts for her". If one cannot intimate, does that mean that the whole proceedings must fall?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the wording at the top of page 18 says that the procurator fiscal must
	<br><q><p>"take all reasonable steps to intimate".</p></q>
Therefore, if he has taken all reasonable steps and has nevertheless been unable to intimate, that will be a matter which he can draw to the attention of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems desirable that not simply the spouse but also the solicitor should be intimated to. Often a spouse might be very distressed and not have the sense or imagination to realise that she should make that intimation known to her solicitor right away, to ensure that the protection envisaged can be properly exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 is the main amendment of this group. The hon. Gentleman's proposals envisage that the fiscal would indicate to the solicitor and the spouse when the matter was to be dealt with by the courts at the very beginning. The time-scale involved could mean that in some circumstances there was less than an hour after the solicitor had been told that the matter would be raised in court that morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, the incident that led to the arrest had taken place during the previous night— say, on Sunday night—it is possible that on Monday morning, without any warning, the spouse and her solicitor could be informed that the husband was appearing in court that morning and that, if they wished to take any steps to protect their position or to use their rights under the Bill, they had to be in court that morning without fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time scale might simply be impractical. There might be fundamental reasons why it would not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
work. The solicitor might be in another court and there simply would not be time to make alternative arrangements. The spouse might find it impossible to be there for various reasons. Although I have no doubt that in some circumstances the procedure envisaged by the hon. Gentleman would work reasonably well, we are forced to consider a procedure that will be available to a spouse irrespective of questions of convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, on that basis the hon. Gentleman's proposals do not offer a proper solution to the difficulty. He has taken exception to clause 15{7)(a) (iii) which states that the procurator fiscal shall present a petition to the court with
	<br><q><p>"a request that the non-applicant spouse be detained for a further period not exceeding 2 days".</p></q>
I stress that, given that we are dealing with a petition submitted by the procurator fiscal, the petition must have a conclusion; it cannot simply be a statement of facts. Although the conclusion might be a request of the kind suggested, there is no need for the fiscal to argue the case or even speak to that aspect of the petition. That is merely the formality of the document that would be submitted to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question that the hon. Gentleman asked was whether, in deciding whether to grant an extension of the detention period, a court should be required to take account of whether there was a prima facie case of breach of interdict on the basis of the facts and circumstances reported. I am interested in that suggestion and prepared to consider it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practical terms it makes sense to be certain that there is the prospect of an action succeeding. Clearly, if the sheriff were satisfied that an action should be initiated but the circumstances were such that there was no prospect of it succeeding, it would be pointless to require any further detention of the husband. But I shall certainly give the matter further thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final point to make on whether the procedure would fall if there were no intimation. I am advised that it might be difficult for the sheriff to be satisfied that proceedings for a breach would be taken if he could ascertain that there had been no intimation to the wife and that there would be no further detention. That would not prevent the wife from subsequently taking proceedings if she so wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain respects the hon. Gentleman's proposals are more attractive than the Government's alternative if we were dealing only with those cases where it was reasonable to assume that there would be plenty of time for the spouse and her solicitor to be in court, even if the notice given was extremely short. But we have to deal with a much wider series of possibilities and I have reluctantly come to the view that the clause in its present form may be the best solution. But we shall give further consideration to the hon. Gentleman's alternative approach. His amendments deserve serious consideration, not only for the time taken to develop them but also for the objectives he had in mind in putting them forward. But for the reasons that I have outlined it is un-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
likely that we shall be able to commend them either to the Committee or to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his courteous response. I accept that there are substantial difficulties in the scheme that I put forward. We are united in trying to reach a solution to a problem that is made more difficult by the time constraints, whichever way we work it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there will be difficulties if a spouse is arrested in the middle of the night and appears in court at 10 a.m. the next morning. But my experience of sheriff court custody cases is, increasingly, that, for a number of reasons, they tend to appear at 2 p.m. and not at 10 a.m.—certainly in Glasgow and Airdrie, where I used to practice regularly. It is commonplace in every court that I know for matters occasionally to be referred or pushed back to 2 p.m. for a variety of administrative reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while I accept that it alters the balance slightly, there might at least be half a day clear for lawyers to get their partners organised, even if they cannot organise themselves. I used to be much better at organising my partner than myself for some pesky emergency that arrived on my doorstep at 9 am. To some extent that is a serious point because, at the end of the day, on the assumption that this whole thing is justified, we shall have a process in a sheriff court within 48 hours anyway. Perhaps it is not unreasonable to assume that even within half a day someone can travel to court to make an application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the reference to the petition was a bit of a non-point. Of course one might have to change the matter further, but the petition would not necessarily have to have a conclusion. The procurator fiscal, who helps the court on a number of occasions, could make a narration of facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the word " petition", he will understand that it will be difficult to have something called a petition which did not petition anything to happen. That is, in a sense, a pernickety problem, although it is a real one. In fact, as long as the procurator fiscal was not required to argue the case as mentioned in the petition but it was only a formality that had to be observed, I should have thought that that would meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense we are talking about nothing. It is an admirable piece of narrative drafting. If the provisions were drafted so that the procurator fiscal " shall present to the court an account of the facts " instead of " shall present a petition," it would do no great harm. If it got rid of the semantic difficulty by the need for a conclusion, there might be some merit in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point to which I wish to speak is the sheriff's duty. The Minister was kind enough to say that he would consider a test of a prime facia case on the facts that had been presented. It could be rather tough on the sheriff, because subsection 7(b) states:
	<br><q><p>"if it appears to the sheriff that—
	<br><q><p>(i) proceedings for breach of interdict will be taken".</p></q></p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
It appears that he will have no advice. There may be the negative fact that intimation has been made. But one cannot assume from that that proceedings will be taken. I do not see how he will approach that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that duty is to be replaced by the fact that the sheriff must be satisfied that there is a prime facia case for breach of interdict, that is something which the sheriff could understand and on which he could be asked to pass an opinion. But he cannot be asked to put himself in the position of the applicant with whom he has had no contact and from whom he has had no communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that no changes are made to the clause, will the Minister say whether an applicant spouse or her agent, will have right of audience in court? Presumably there will be an opportunity for the non-applicant spouse, who is in the dock, to make representation why he should not be put in gaol for two days while his spouse makes up her mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that no specific provision has been made for an applicant spouse to have right of audience, and that matter could be tidied up at this stage. If there is no such provision, the Minister could consider whether there should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no strong views, but I should prefer the matter to be dealt with on the basis that I have described. If we are sticking to the Minister's scenario, perhaps he should consider whether the right of audience in these quasi-civil proceedings should be allowed if the applicant spouse wishes to be heard on the ground that the sheriff may not have understood a spouse's intentions of interdict proceedings or if a substantial risk of violence is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to make one or two comments on that last point, but I am happy with his suggestion that he will look seriously at the possibility of changing the sheriff's responsibility, because in a much weaker and tentative manner the Minister has not totally closed the door to looking at some other facets as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no specific provision in the clause for a wife to be neither present or represented, hut nor is it excluded. It is a matter for the court entirely to decide whether it wishes to hear any representations a spouse may wish to make, particularly if the question was being considered of a substantial risk of violence by the non-applicant spouse towards the applicant spouse or towards any child of the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the wife was in, or represented in, court it seems likely that she would be given the opportunity to express her views. We shall certainly consider whether there should be a specific right of audience as the hon. Gentleman suggested. I suspect that even without that right such an opportunity would be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will accept that many sheriffs make a point of drawing people to the bench for a private word. It is very different if a gowned figure is purporting to represent a spouse. He may wish, as of right, to make
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
representations because they see that the sheriff has made the wrong decision. It is unlikely that the sheriff would call them up in the way he might a friendly probation officer or the wife of the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is virtue in having the right to say anything, I should have thought that, prime facie, there was some virtue in giving specific right of audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 18, line 33, at end add
	<br><q><p>"And in computing the period of two days referred to in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b)</i> above, no account shall be taken of a Saturday or Sunday or of any holiday in the court in which the proceedings for breach of interdict will require to be raised.".</p></q>
The amendment is intended to make it clear that the two possible days of further detention refer to two court days, excluding weekends and court holidays. Otherwise, the fundamental purpose of clause 15, which is to permit an action for breach of interdict to be brought by the wife without her being at risk of further violence or molestation by her husband before the court hearing, could be frustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, the first court appearance was on a Friday, without the amendment a violent husband would have to be released on the Sunday before the action for breach of interdict had been heard. I am sure that there is a need for such an amendment, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the amendment is necessary, but reluctantly, as it takes us back to the Bail Act which was quoted in evidence against me a few minutes ago when I referred to the abolition of Saturday courts under section 10 of that Act. I still think that it is unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a spouse is arrested on Thursday evening, he appears in court on Friday morning. At that point, the court says that it will hold the spouse in custody for two days. The theory of that is to allow two days in which actions can be raised. Presumably that leaves the whole of Friday. Saturdays and Sundays are non-days; they do not count. Monday is the second day, so it would be either Monday evening or Tuesday morning before the two days had elapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem does not arise because of the Bail Act. We are dealing with civil courts. Therefore, whatever fault the Bail Act may have, it is not relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a slightly more esoteric point, but he did not give me notice of it and I am not sure that I can give a complete answer at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
the question, the hon. Member for Garscadden is, and he is still waiting for an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, if a person was arrested on Thursday night and appeared in court on Friday, it could be Tuesday midnight before the full two day period had expired. However, I wish to think about this matter and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman in a more fulsome way on the matter.M</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could write fully rather than fulsomely. I am always delighted to see signs of friendship from any quarter of this place. I am glad to leave the matter there and await the Minister's letter with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 18, line 33, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(8) Sections (4) to (7) above inclusive shall only apply when intimation to the relevant Chief Constable has been made in terms of section 14(4) of this Act.".</p></q>
This is merely a probing amendment to tidy up a query. Perhaps the answer is obvious, but it is not obvious to me. As the Committee will know, in order to start these proceedings, after the matrimonial interdict has been granted it has to be intimated to the chief constable under clause 14(4). It must be intimated
	<br><q><p>"(a) to the chief constable of the police area in which the matrimonial home is situated; and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>	<i>(b)</i> if the applicant spouse—resides in another police area, to the chief constable of that other police area".</p></q>
I presume that the point of that provision is so that the police know that the interdict exists. For example, when he police are called to a house, think that there is a breach of interdict and are told by the wife that there is such an interdict, they should be able to telephone or contact on radio their headquarters and establish that the interdict exists as the wife alleges. It might be an instance in which no criminal charges are likely to result but if the wife is correct about the interdict, there is clearly a prima facie breach and, given the distress of the parties—children and so on—once the policeman has established the existence of the interdict, he can then act on it. I think that is the theory of the provision and I am all with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am not clear about is this. If there has been no intimation of the interdict, is the rest of the procedure floored? A right of arrest is attached under clause 14(1). Can that right of arrest be exercised if there has been no intimation to the chief constable? I assume that the answer is " Yes", but I suppose that there is an argument that an intimation is an essential and preliminary part of the process and that without it all that flows through the rest of clause 14—the arrest, the no proceedings, the clause 15(4) procedure and so on—is invalid and cannot proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procurator fiscal would presumably have to narrate in his petition to the court under clause 15(7) that there was such an interdict, that it had been intimated and that the terms were as follows, as that is the basis on which any decision by the sheriff must be made. I am only canvassing the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
possibilities, but I want to know the position if that intimation has not taken place. Do subsections (4) to (7) of clause 15 become inoperative? I am sure that the Minister understands the burden of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can circumvent the problem in this way. The hon. Gentleman envisages a situation where a person has been arrested and brought before the court, but the police will wish to use their power of arrest only if the granting of that right has been intimated to them. In other words, a police officer is unlikely to use any power of arrest if he has not been informed in advance of his right to do so. He has not the power of arrest unless the court has granted it. Therefore, when for one reason or another intimation had not taken place, it is unlikely that an arrest would occur because the police officer would not have known that he had such a power of arrest since he had received no intimation of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting scenario. The Minister is of course right in saying that it is unlikely. Let us assume for a moment that our perhaps rather inexperienced police officer turns up at the house, finds lady in tears, children yowling and marked but no evidence to allow an assault charge. The lady says that there is an interdict. He naively and unwisely does not check and does not find that it has not been intimated—scenario one—and proceeds to arrest
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then came up against the phrase in clause 15(1)(b):
	<br><q><p>"shall not subject the officer to any claim whatsoever."</p></q>
It will perhaps become a useful blanket indemnity for that officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rest of the procedure is followed and there has been no intimation, is there a duty on the procurator fiscal to check with the courts, or must he immediately release and say that the whole case is "non est" because there has been no intimation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take scenario two, in which the officer checks, finds that there has been no intimation and does not arrest. Is it clear that he must not arrest or is he merely extremely unlikely to do so and very wise not to? That is rather a different scene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that there is no fundamental reason of policy why it is desirable that action which would otherwise be valid should be invalid simply because there was no intimation to the chief constable. I do not think that that is a crucial matter. Intimation to the non-applicant spouse is a different matter. It would clearly be a fundamental defect to hold that person responsible for breach of an exclusion order or interdict if he never knew of its existence, since he is the person against whom action is being taken. There is no fundamental reason of policy why the whole procedure should become invalid simply because the chief constable was not told or for some reason intimation did not reach him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the drafting of the clause, but I see no reason why we should wish it to have that effect. If the existing drafting might lead to that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
effect, I am certainly prepared to concede the need for an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to leave it at that. I take the Minister's point that there is a difference between clause 14(2) where
	<br><q><p>"A power of arrest attached to an interdict by virtue of subsection (1) above shall not have effect until"</p></q>
intimation is served on the non-applicant spouse and clause 14(4) which merely places a duty on the applicant spouse who
	<br><q><p>"shall, as soon as possible after service of the interdict ensure that there is delivered".</p></q>
It is a different form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going into the matter at great length there is some confusion here about whether intimation is of such paramount importance for the proceedings before the sheriff, who must surely want to see a copy of the interdict before he considers his duties under clause 15(7)(b). Perhaps it should be made clear whether it is possible to go ahead, putting the absence of intimation right later by, say, inquiry in the civil side of the sheriff court, or whether the fact that there has been no intimation invalidates the whole proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the provision is a little ambiguous at present. Although I tend to agree with the Minister that it might be rather hard if failure to intimate invalidated the proceedings, there are certain practical difficulties in proceeding if there has not been intimation. Perhaps it is worth considering what the effects would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to allow more discretion to the courts to extend the occupancy rights of a cohabitee so that they can have such rights for an indefinite period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people are living together on a casual and temporary basis, it may be argued that the cohabitee should not get occupancy rights. There may be a case for putting down a statutory limit of three months in such cases where occupancy rights are given to one of the cohabitees. However, there could be other cases of long-standing relationships, people living with each other as if they were man and wife for far longer than some maried couples although the relationship has never been formalised in a marriage ceremony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to some members of the Committee by those who have experience of such cases that there may be special circumstances in some relationships in which the occupancy rights should be similar, if not identical, to the occupancy rights given to married spouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that some may argue against that, saying, " If they have been living with each other for that long, why on earth have they not formalised the marriage? " They may say that that would be reason enough for not giving the cohabiting person the same protection as the married spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going into great detail about the pros and cons of that argument, if a relationship has reached a stage of breakdown or dispute, as envisaged in this part of the Bill, it is hardly likely that the circumstances with which we are dealing are conducive to the relationship being formalised. We are dealing with a breakdown in a relationship and it appears to me that, especially in longstanding relationships, it may be much fairer to give the courts more discretion, rather than to lay down the maximum time limit of three months, as in subsection 	<i>(1)(b).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a precendent in other pieces of legislation and Government regulations about social security for treating cohabitees as if they were married. In certain circumstances, when a couple are living together as man and wife, they are treated by the Department of Health and Social Security as if they were man and wife, incurring appropriate obligations of financial support and so on. It does not seem logical in this legislation about occupancy rights

Details that have been forwarded to me by Women's Aid of a typical case that has come to its notice. A woman now living in one of the Women's Aid refuges has lived with a man for 17 years, and has two children, aged 15 and 16. If the courts are not allowed the discretion that my amendment would give them to extend occupancy rights beyond three months that woman and her children would, presumably, be threatened every thre months with the possibility of eviction from the home in which they have lived for 17 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is only one case—there are many others. However, it is also worth pointing out that in some cases the tenancy of the house may have been given to one or other of the spouses because, for example, they had several children during their long partnership. That partnership might have been the reason for granting them tenancy and occupancy of the house in the first place. Therefore, in such circumstances it would be unfair if the cohabitee were threatened with eviction after three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Long debates could take place about the morality of cohabitation and the way that the law should regard it. I intend to spare the Committee that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments are on much the same lines as those of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), although, perhaps predictably—I do not know whether I should say that I do not go so far down the logical road or that I do not go to the extremes that my hon. Friend has adopted. However, we are spiritually on the same side of the argument. That may—or may not—be of some consolation to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the clause properly recognises the fact that the law must pay attention to the rights of cohabitees. People live together in stable unions for long periods and sometimes there are children of that union. The law and the courts must recognise that social reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment No. 142, unlike that of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, is not 	<i>to</i> take out the three months upper limit on the first occupancy right but to increase it to six months. That is a totally sensible and over-modest proposal in some ways—a year might have been better. But that is not to say that that limit, of however many months it may be, must be granted: it is a right to grant an occupancy right not exceeding that. If a woman had lived with a man for a long time and they had a family, the court might consider three months to be an irrelevancy and might want to say six months. I point to that example because that is what my amendment seeks to do. It seems wrong that the court cannot say that but should have to say " not exceeding three months".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, if three months is appropriate, the court can limit it to three months: six months would be an upper limit. It would give the courts greater flexibility and would be a very small concession.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
I think that the Minister should look at the amendment sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 is more important. It seeks to take out on the second and subsequent extensions the present limit of six months and to insert
	<br><q><p>"such a period as may seem appropriate in all the circumstances".</p></q>
That is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the courts will always have to make a rough and ready judgment, but there may be cases where there is a young family and a lengthy history of cohabitation when it would be perfectly proper for the court to say that it will protect them for, let us say, a period which would allow the children to move to primary school, or whatever it may be —even a three or a five years limit, or whatever the court thinks appropriate in the circumstances. The court must remember that if these people were married they would have an occupancy right which would last as long as they were married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parallel there is to give a fairly wide discretion to the courts. That is the point of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the amount of time that the court may grant to a person who is not a spouse but the cohabiting partner in relation to the exercise of occupancy rights. The hon. Gentleman's amendments have varying effects, but their net effect is to allow much more time than is presently provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is generally accepted that the position of a cohabiting partner should, when we are dealing with the specific legal rights involved, be different from that of the entitled spouse, given that the legal rights of the individual are being superseded because the social considerations are rightly brought into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Law Commission considered the matter, it took a much narrower approach than that which currently exists in the Bill. In its original memorandum the Law Commission proposed:
	<br><q><p>"A fixed occupancy period of three months might suffice for this purpose".</p></q>
It did not envisage any further extensions beyond that period. Nevertheless, as a result of the representations received to the memorandum, the Law Commission said:
	<br><q><p>"On reconsideration, we think that such a period might not give sufficient time for an unmarried partner to find suitable alternative accommodation and we therefore now propose that the period of three months should be capable of being extended by the court for one further period of not more than three months."</p></q>
Therefore, the Law Commission's own final recommendation was for an initial period of at most three months, plus a maximum extension of three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way that the Government have considered the matter is considerably more liberal than the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
Law Commission's own approach. From the wording of the clause the Committee will see that not only have we provided for a second period of up to six months compared with the Law Commission's three months, but have provided for that six month period to be repeated indefinitely if the court thinks it appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the only difference between the proposals in the Bill and what Opposition Members are suggesting does not relate to the maximum length of time for which a cohabiting partner might have occupancy rights granted to them. In both cases— at least in theory—an unlimited time could be considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference between the two sides of the Committee at this stage is that in its present form the Bill requires the court to give fresh consideration to this matter at the end of an initial period of three months and thereafter at the end of any subsequent period of six months, but if it thinks that the circumstances which led it to give an occupancy right in the first place are still sufficiently strong to justify a further extension, it may do so indefinitely, because the clause says:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that the court may extend the said period for a further period or periods, no such period exceeding 6 months."</p></q>
Therefore, I should have thought that that was a much more sensible way to approach the matter. If we area dealing with people who, by definition, are not spouses and have no legal relationship with the other partner, it is not unreasonable that the court should have to reconsider the matter to decide whether an occupancy right should still be exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire expressed concern about possible eviction. He will appreciate that the situation for these people will be exactly the same in this respect as for any other spouse, in that it is for the court to decide whether the occupancy rights provided for under the Bill should be enforced in a particular circumstance. The only difference that will now exist between a cohabiting partner and a spouse is the need for the court to reconsider whether that decision should still be sustained after three months and successive potiential periods of six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference in principle between the amendments and the Bill in its present form. However, in the circumstances I have outlined and bearing in mind how far we have already moved from the Law Commission's recommendations, the Bill provides an appropriate balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Bill is more liberal than the Scottish Law Commission's recommendations. With respect, that would not be difficult. The Scottish Law Commission is not the most liberal of bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not speak in detail before to amendment No. 161. I thought that it was intended that we should take it separately, although I agree that the amendments are very much interlinked and it is a good idea to deal with them together. Amendment No. 161 would allow more flexibility to the court to use its discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
Under the Bill, which is certainly an improvement on what the Scottish Law Commission proposed, it would still be essential presumably for the courts to review the case every six months. In a case where the cohabitee has a long-standing relationship with the other person and has had several children by him, it seems unfair that that person should be given occupancy rights simply on an initial maximum of three months and then on further extensions of six months. So twice every year the former cohabitee would presumably have to go to court, or the court would have to review the case and state whether the occupancy rights were to be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. As he said, in theory at least it would still be possible for occupancy rights to continue indefinitely. But I am not happy about their having to be reviewed by the courts every six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My good friend the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is being far too moderate. He said that he is not entirely happy, but I am very unhappy. I am not at all convinced by the Minister's argument, although he has come a long way from the totally unsatisfactory position apparently adopted by the Law Commission. The fact that the commission is very wrong is no basis for his claiming to be just a bit wrong, which is what his argument amounts to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to write in an element of flexibility for the courts to take account of the social demands of a case. No one is saying that a cohabitee must be given a longer or unlimited period. Indeed, the possibility of an unlimited occupancy right would be very rare indeed. But there are cases—I know such people—in which a person might qualify simply on the facts and on social justice for that sort of treatment. It may be said that if two people are silly enough not to wish to enter the legal state of matrimony, they should pay a price for it. But that is not satisfactory, and it would mean that the children might also pay a considerable price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider this further. If he accepts that there is a possibility of lengthy occupancy rights being given to cohabitees—I think that we all accept that possibility, and the Minister is at least conceding that he is on the same side of the argument—it is, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire says, unsatisfactory that a person should have to go to the courts with such regularity and at such short intervals as the Bill stipulates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one wants to write a charter for profligacy, but it seems sensible that the courts should be able to cater for the not uncommon situation of a long-standing union and the children born within it. I genuinely regret not having proposed a year instead of six months; it could perhaps be condemned as timid, but it is at least a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the point about a right of review for the entitled spouse, if we are to accept amendment No. 143, but the drafting of that could surely be managed by the Minister.

Although at this late hour I do not intend to spring a vote on the Committee—although it is up to the Committee—if the Minister cannot give hope of reconsideration, we shall wish to reconsider the position with a view to tabling an amendment on Report. If a lady had been living with a man for eight or ten years, and had very young children by him, but their stable union had gone wrong, it would be useless to say that, theoretically, the non-entitled partner could go back for three-monthly and then six-monthly intervals indefinitely. The fact that he or she had to do so would make it seem as though he or she were on a short fuse, in the house under false pretences, and unwanted and un-welcomed by the law, as well, possibly as the cohabitee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, a much greater discretion should be available to the courts, and if the Minister cannot come up with something a litle more adventurous, we may have to consider returning to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether a sense of adventure is a proper consideration to apply in a a matter of this kind. The Bill covers an important new aspect of the law which is entirely unprecedented. The legal rights of a person to occupy his own home are now capable of being superseded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to say that it is justifiable to supersede the legal rights of a person—normally the husband—when we are considering the rights of the person with whom he has a legal relationship, and who is legally recognised as a spouse. But the clause provides that, although there is no legal relationship between the two cohabiting partners, the legal rights of those partners should be superseded by the granting of an occupancy right to the other. This is a controversial clause which will not commend itself to some sections of the community. It is not reasonable, in those circumstances, that different considerations should apply from those which apply to spouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already gone substantially further than the Law Commission recommend—I appreciate that that in itself is not a conclusive argument—and I think that many people would rightly take exception to the suggestion that the open-ended, perhaps indefinite, occupancy right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is proposed that an initial period of occupancy of six months maximum should be possible, although it need not be that long, after that it should be left to the court's discretion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a logical inconsistency in the suggestion that the granting of an occupancy right should initially be limited to six months, but that six months later, when the person may reasonably be considered to have had time to find alternative accommodation, the court should be able to grant an open-ended occupancy right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the amendment states. It refers to
	<br><q><p>"such a period as may seem appropriate in all the circumstances".</p></q>
That involves at least the possibility of a completely open-ended occupancy right, or certainly one reigning for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A period of 20 years, or the lifetime of the person concerned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When dealing with a couple who have no legal relationship, the consideration should be how much time is required for the partner who has no legal rights to the property be reasonably able to find alternative accommodation. That is the main consideration, particularly if there are children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we accepted that there was a powerful case for going beyond the narrow confines of the three-month period which the Law Commission recommended, and for not only allowing a six-month period, but, more importantly, allowing that period to be renewed on each occasion if it was clear that, through no fault of the person, there was still no suitable alternative accommodation available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is the proper approach, given that we are dealing with the unprecedented matter of overruling the legal rights of one partner. We shall consider the Opposition's points, but I cannot hold out much hope that we shall provide for the general open-ended possibilities inherent in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister hinted that he would reconsider this matter between now and Report, although I am not entirely happy with his reply. It is unfair that any spouse, particularly where one spouse—usually the wife—would be left with the children, should face such an unacceptable degree of uncertainty about her occupancy rights, as she would if the case had to be reviewed by the courts every six months. There should be either an extension of the time limit, as proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, or the removal of all reference to maximum time limits and greater discretion for the courts in this matter. That would be more acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to give the Minister time to reflect further on the matter between now and Report. He mentioned, however, the fact that the legal rights of one spouse could, under the clause, be superseded by those of someone involved in a relationship that had no legal basis. The legal rights could have been conferred on the person in the first place as a result of the relationship with the cohabitee. The tenancy of a house is sometimes given to a man, for example, because of circumstances concerning the woman with whom he is living, particularly if children are involved. That may be how the legal rights to tenancy and occupancy arose in the first place. I am, therefore, not entirely satisfied with the Minister's explanation.

Such situations are not so very unusual in the types of breakdown to which the Bill applies. I am informed by Scottish Women's Aid, for example, that in Dundee, between January 1980 and April 1981, 141 women sought refuge. Thirty-one of them were cohabiting with violent men but were not married to them and, on average, each of those women had two children. About a quarter of the women seeking aid in the refuges, therefore, were not living with a spouse but were cohabiting. The amendment is in the interests not only of the partners but of the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to push the amendment to a Division, but I hope very much that the Minister will consider it seriously before Report. If he does not produce on Report, a Government amendment to give more flexibility to the courts, we may feel obliged to table another amendment to that effect at that stage. Meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 19, line 26, at end insert " sections 6 and 7".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is not the place for a major and wide-ranging debate about the rights of cohabitees or the distinction between the status of a cohabitee and that of a married person. We do not necessarily want to concern ourselves with the law of California, rights of patrimony—if that is the technical term— and all the ingenious ladies who have raised massive actions against film stars on the basis of cohabitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, like to consider one or two technical points, and I think I can conveniently do so on this amendment. The amendment purports to add clauses 6 and 7 to the list of clauses which will apply to a cohabitee who has successfully applied for occupancy rights under clause 16(1). As the Committee will remember from our discussions earlier today, those clauses deal with dealings by third parties, with the question whether they can defeat occupancy rights, and with the need for a non-entitled spouse to consent to any sale of a matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moral terms, there ought, perhaps, to be some capital claim against a house that has in effect been a matrimonial home occupied by two people over a lengthy period, during which they have held themselves out to be man and wife—a house towards which the wife, if she has been working, may have contributed materially, and to which she will certainly have contributed as the mother of the family, if there are children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the law of Scotland, I suppose that if those people have lived together for a very lengthy period of time there could be a declarator of marriage by habit and repute, but I suspect that that procedure is falling largely into disuetude, although I have no statistics on the matter. The concept is certainly difficult. There is a strong case—though not one that we can consider at length in this debate—for saying that a spouse ought, in the circumstances I have outlined, to have a capital claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will always be a matter of balance. No doubt it is a matter of dispute. I take the Minister's point that there may be those in some of the churches in Scotland who wil look askance at such a proposition. But I am conscious of the hour, and I do not want to invite the Committee to debate the matter at length; I merely put down those remarks as a marker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not seem to state specifically— although I presume that it is a matter of common sense—what happens if a cohabitee is granted a declarator of occupancy under clause 16(1) and perhaps an exclusion order under clause 4 or regulation of occupancy under clause 16(3). I presume it is self-evident that while that occupancy right exists, it would be impossible for there to be any dealings in the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may not be a matter of immense importance because clearly the house will not be sellable in the normal way if there is an occupancy right that is being exercised. If Miss X, the cohabitee, is living in the house, it is unlikely that it will readily find a purchaser on the open market. But exceptional circumstances might arise and I want to make sure that there could not be a dealing, of the kind referred to in clause 6 in connection with entitled and non-entitled spouses, when a court had made a specific, time-limited occupancy order in favour of the cohabitee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there was a three-month or six-month order, the owner of the house—the entitled person but not an entitled spouse—might manage to sell the house, claiming that the occupancy right would come to an end after six months and would not be renewed. If the occupancy right was then renewed, presumably that right would defeat the occupancy rights of the third party who had bought the house. I think that that is common sense. The whole purpose of clause 16 would be defeated if it were not so. It is not, however, so far as I can see, stated in the Bill, and I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has suggested a situation in which a cohabiting partner has been granted an occupancy right. He has asked whether, during the duration of that occupancy right, the provisions of clause 6 could be applied. Clause 6, with the restrictions it introduces, is not one of the clauses referred to in clause 16. That being so, if there were to be a dealing under clause 6 whereby a person disposed of the property, it would be difficult to say that the rights of the third party would be superseded by the potential interests and occupancy rights of the cohabiting partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how we could overcome that problem without giving a cohabiting partner exactly the same legal rights as a non-entitled spouse. Indeed, there would be an additional problem. A third party may have some means of knowing whether the person selling the property is married, but to require a bona fide third party to establish whether that person has, or has had, a cohabiting partner, or to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
take any interest in the question, would be to impose on him a task that would be highly undesirable, if not impossible to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that protection of the type that the hon. Gentleman seeks is realistic in the circumstances. Quite apart from whether it is a desirable policy to give a cohabiting partner the same legal rights in a dealing under clause 6, there would be practical difficulties when conveyancing in seeking to establish whether there was not simply a spouse but a person who, although with no legal relationship, happened to have lived with the vendor for a period of time that might bring him or her into the categories referred to in clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I accept that there is a real problem here, but I do not believe it to be practical or desirable to try and overcome that problem in the only way that might in theory be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficulty, and of course I recognise that clause 6 does not apply—hence the amendment. I am seized of the difficulties of applying clause 6 per se and I am not convinced that it is the answer. It was merely a way of drawing attention to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that there is not some other way round the problem by including a statement in the Bill to the effect that while an occupancy right is to be exercised, or is valid in terms of a court order under clause 16(1), that should take precedence over any rights that may be acquired by a third party in the dwelling. In other words, if I buy the house from the cohabiting male and do so on the basis that there is a lady living in it, I have to take the chance, which I shall have to calculate, that she may be able to extend her occupancy rights. If she does so, that is my bad luck. She can exercise those rights despite my wishes and despite the fact that I am now the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be an obscure case, but one might otherwise get a conspiracy, or what might almost amount to a conspiracy. If I have a co-habitee with occupancy rights, but with whom I was—to my mind at least—finished, I might " sell " the house to a friend, in order to defeat the possibility of an extension of the period of occupancy, although the sale might never get beyond binding missives. That would be inequitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I accept the Minister's point about the straight application of clauses 6 and 7, but will he consider at least the proposition that if there are occupancy rights under a court order they should not be prejudiced by dealings? I am not ruling out a dealing or suggesting that there has to be consent, but merely making it statutorily plain that any dealing that takes place does not prejudice the occupancy rights or any extension of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems perfectly simple. Selling the house would of course be difficult, but on the balance of justice that is something that we could live with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been brought to my attention that there is a means within the Bill as it stands whereby a cohabiting partner could be protected in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
the position envisaged by the hon. Gentleman. He will see that clause 16 applies in relation to clause 3. Under clause 3(l)(e) there may be an application to the court for an order
	<br><q><p>"protecting the occupancy rights of the applicant spouse in relation to the other spouse."</p></q>
That also applies to the cohabiting partner in relation to the other cohabiting partner. The court could therefore interdict the entitled partner—if I can use that phrase—from disposing of the home while his partner has occupancy rights. That discretion would be open to the courts if such an application were made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A cohabiting partner could be granted occupancy rights and presumably therefore be in occupation of the house. If she had reason to believe that the other partner was disposing of the property, she could then go to the court under clause 3(l)(e) to ask for an interdict, interdicting the other partner from continuing to seek to sell the house, given that she had been given an occupancy right. If the court agreed with her, and granted such an interdict, it would have the desired effect. That seems a more acceptable way of achieving the objective that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Any alternative proposal would involve all the problems that we have both previously turned out attention to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his ingenious suggestion, which goes some way towards meeting the point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty with that proposal is that it would produce exactly the unfair result for the bona fide party that we are seeking to avoid for non-entitled spouses. If the cohabiting partner were to have an overriding right where an occupancy right had been granted, it would mean that a bona fide third party who had purchased a house would find that although he was the owner of a house he could not live in it because of the existence of an occupancy right of a cohabiting partner of whom he was not even aware, nor could reasonably have been expected to be aware. That is the problem that we have all agreed to solve for non-entitled spouses, and it would be unacceptable to give a cohabiting partner a greater right than a non-entitled spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, Mr. Henderson, we can think about this question.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be wrong, but I should have thought that the essence of clause 16 is that the cohabitee who wishes to exercise her occupancy right is more likely to be in the house.

away from the house for such a long time that it could be sold with apparent vacant possession. I think that the cohabitee would be in considerable difficulty with lock, stock and perhaps not barrel but pram, if she had departed and allowed the house to be shown as vacant to the prospective third party purchaser. Therefore I am not entirely satisfied about the substance of the Minister's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this has been a long day, and I think that the Minister has done something to satisfy me with his reference to clause 3(1)	<i>(e)</i>. I shall consider his remarks and perhaps take some advice as to whether other people would regard the position as satisfactory, and also whether what seemed to me to be a simpler and more straightforward solution presents the difficulties which the Minister has anticipated. At this stage, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment is intended to make it clear that the non-entitled partner's occupancy rights should last only as long as the other partner remains entiteld. As the Bill stands, there could be some confusion as to whether the rights do terminate in this way. The amendment ensures that the non-entitled partner's rights are no greater than the rights of a non-entitled spouse in a similar situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite so. This is an interesting amendment—it brings us straight back to the point that we have just discussed. It means that the rights of the non-entitled partner—the cohabitee who has made the application under section 16—end as soon as her cohabiting partner concludes binding missives to sell the property, or possibly when the price is paid. Can the Minister tell me at what point in the conveyancing transaction such rights are extinguished under the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely happy about this, because it specifically underlines the fear that I had that occupancy rights could be defeated by a sale. If I follow what the Minister says, I could have a cohabitee who had six months to run of an occupancy right —she has the maximum. In month 1, I could hurry along and sell it to Mr X. Mr X might say " I don't want to buy it because of the occupancy rights. I am not going to get vacant possession. I want vacant possession." I would say to him " Don't worry about that. As soon as we have completed the sale the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
rights of the cohabitee end because I am no longer the owner of the property and you can put her on the street." There could then be a court order.

The circumstance that this provision was meant to cover is not the third party who has purchased the house, or who thinks that he is purchasing the house, but the person, such as a building society, who may have lent a mortgage to the husband and where there may have been a default on the mortgage payments. It is in order to ensure that a building society, which would normally be able to recover possession of the property in the event of mortgage payments not being made, shall not be prevented from doing so because of the existence of an occupancy right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that a building society's position should not be jeopardised simply because the cohabiting partner has been given an occupancy right. Otherwise, there could be the extraordinary situation of the cohabiting partner, having separated from the other partner, having greater rights than she would have had if she was still living with the cohabiting partner who had defaulted on his mortgage payments. Clearly that would be an undesirable consequence, and that is the circumstance that the amendment seeks to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment defines more closely a " child of the family " whose interests will be an important consideration before the courts when an order is sought under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new definition will include natural, adopted and stepchildren of either spouse, along with grandchildren who may be being brought up by one or both of the spouses because their parents are dead or incapable (or unwilling) to look after them. The child may be of any age so that the interests of a dependant person of mature years, who may for example be disabled, and who still lives at home will not be ignored. The new definition will not, however, include a friend's child who is residing temporarily in the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this also covers the point raised in the hon. Gentleman's own amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This probably is helpful. I have not considered the Government amendment closely enough and the Minister will no doubt help me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point originated from the Law Society of Scotland, which felt that the word " dependant" should be included to make it clear that we were not considering the interests of a child of the family, who might be 23 and earning more than the rest of the household put together, but being a bachelor did not mind having a " pad " in this parents' house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who discussed this with me thought that it was reasonable that the word " dependant" should appear in the definition, to ensure that, of course, one could consider a mentally defective son, who might well be of age, but who was clearly dependant on his parents for his upkeep and general care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that those in that category, including physically handicapped persons, should be covered by the definition, but we should not trammel the courts, when they are considering orders under the Act, with spurious arguments about what may or may not be in the interests of adult children. Such difficulties might not occur often. If they did, they would be dismissed fairly easily by the courts. But it seemed worth while to clear up the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain that the definition that the Minister has produced meets the point. It refers to a child
	<br><q><p>"who has been brought up or accepted by either spouse as if he or she were a child of that spouse, whatever the age of such a child…may be."</p></q>
For example, for a long time when I was in my mid-twenties, and certainly earning comfortably as a lawyer, I was living at home. I would not have thought that my interests or comfort should have been a relevant consideration when deciding the balance to be struck between my parents if they had gone to war—as they fortunately did not—and ultimately to the courts looking for a settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the amendment may be helpful in terms of general definition as to who should be included as a child, the Minister is over-optimistic, I suspect, when he says that it meets my point. Will the Minister address himself to the suggestion that the word "dependant" would be a useful addition— or the spirit of the word " dependant"—if it could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
be incorporated to ensure that only children dependent upon their parents and who rely upon their parents, are considered in the delicate balance to be struck in any dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to consider the wording, but the concern is that there may be a child who is temporarily resident outwith the home— perhaps in a residential home or a children's home of some kind—and is technically no longer dependent on the parents, but who should nevertheless come under the definition.

The clause is intended to deal with the interests of building societies and other heritable creditors so that mortgage or loan repayments are maintained by a non-entitled spouse who is in sole occupation when the entitled spouse is not making the payments —for instance, following his desertion or exclusion. In particular, it will guard against the situation where the heritable security is granted on the basis that the prospective purchaser has falsely declared that he is unmarried, but subsequently his wife appears on the scene to claim her occupancy rights. Without the new clause, she could live indefinitely in what had become the matrimonial home.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exploratory new clause, but it allows the Minister to make one or two comments, which I hope will be useful and may relieve my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been considering many circumstances in which someone entitled normally to live in a house shall no longer live in that house. The outstanding example of that is clause 4, which is an exclusion order. There may be circumstances under clause 3, which is not specifically mentioned in the new clause, where effectively someone will be excluded from his home and will potentially be homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal immediately with clause 4 and the recipient or object of an exclusion order. If someone is excluded, I should like to be clear about his legal status in terms of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. There has been a great deal of discussion about the operation of that Act, and the record of local authorities has varied greatly from area to area. Section 4 defines the
	<br><q><p>"Duties of housing authorities to homeless persons and persons threatened with homelessness".</p></q>
One of the important tests which recurs under the Act is that the local authority's duty is removed unless it is satisfied that the person is not homeless intentionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that there might be a tendency for local authorities, which perhaps do not take as progressive a line on that Act as most members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
of the Committee would wish, to argue "Mr. X was a tenant in one of our houses. Mr. X has been excluded from the house because of his conduct. He has been the subject of a section 4 exclusion order the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act"—as it would be. "Clearly and essentially he is intentionally homeless because, if he had not been beastly to his wife and had not used violence or conduct which was prejudicial to her health and welfare, he would not be in that position." It may be a somewhat obscure line of argument, but it is at least worth rehearsing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put down the new clause because I am anxious for assurances that someone who is, in effect, homeless as a result of an order under any provision of the Bill—I broaden the debate slightly but usefully —will be given priority under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act and the local authority's duties under it. A person who has had to leave his home because of his inability to live with another person under one roof, or because of an exclusion order, should take with him the tenancy seniority that he would have had if he had remained in the matrimonial home. He should be given prority for accommodation similar to that which he enjoyed in the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are difficult areas, and doubtless there is a good deal of come and go and flexibility in interpreting them. The new clause has been tabled to enable the Minister to comment on the matter. I am concerned that, in our anxiety to give justice to wives and children, we should not severely prejudice male spouses or deal with them unsympathetically under the homeless persons' legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that spirit, to set the scene and to invite the Minister to be the star, and perhaps to give encouragement or advice to local authorities, that I commend the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause would have the effect, where a person was the subject of an exclusion order, of saying that the behaviour that may have led to the granting of the order rendered him intentionally homeless. I accept that the mere fact that a person has been subject to an exclusion order should not automatically mean that he should be judged intentionally homeless. But, equally, the opposite also applies. An exclusion order may be granted in a case where it is sensible to take the view that, in the circumstances, the person was rendered intentionally homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if a person's conduct to his spouse is such that he has been warned on several occasions that if he continues to behave in that way, posing a threat to the physical or mental welfare of the wife or the children, he might be made the subject of an exclusion order, I cannot say that in no circumstances would that not be a relevant consideration when determining whether the person should be judged intentionally homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sensible thing is neither to say that it does apply nor to say that it automatically does not, but to apply the normal criteria laid down in the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act. However, even if the clause were accepted, it would be unlikely to have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
much practical effect. The basic question is not only whether a person is intentionally homeless, but whether he is likely to be given priority, which is the only way in which he would be quickly rehoused. He would need to be judged under section 2 of the 1977 Act to be in priority need for accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four circumstances in which a person can be judged to have a priority need for accommodation. First, he or she must be responsible for dependent children. The nature and circumstances of the matter are such that that would be unlikely. Secondly, the person must be pregnant, but again it is unlikely that the excluded spouse would be pregnant. Thirdly, he or she must be vulnerable because of old age or mental or physical disability. As the exclusion order can be made only if there has been a threat to the physical or mental welfare of the spouse, it is unlikely that that condition could be satisfied. Fourthly, there must be an emergency, such as flood, fire or other disaster. It is again unlikely that those criteria would be fulfilled. Therefore, on grounds of both principle and practicality, the clause is unnecessary and should not appeal to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like flogging on when there is little enthusiasm for chasing the hare. But I am not entirely satisfied with what the Minister has said. I am prepared to accept his point about practicalities and the priority under section 2. But section 2 of the 1977 Act does not give the same list as he has just quoted. I can find no reference to pregnancy in it. Perhaps I am looking at an out-of-date statute, although I cannot imagine that any amendments had not been included. The list quotes:
	<br><q><p>"dependent children who are residing with him…he is homeless or threatened with homelessness as a result of an emergency such as flood, fire or any other disaster."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 2(2) states:

He has, only in a specialist sense, a wider vision than I have. He had taken in section 2(2) at a glance. An unworthy thought has entered my mind that someone has done it for him. I accept that there may be difficulties over practicalities, but I am not convinced about the principle. Clearly, we shall not press the new clause to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a strong case for looking at the position of a displaced spouse sympathetically. I should be sorry if no arrangements were made by local authorities to recognise the reality of the situation. I had always understood that certain local authorities gave priority to a spouse whose marriage had failed. Normally, I accept that the wife is homeless, but sometimes there are children involved. But even if children are not involved, I understand that local authorities take the view that if someone
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
is forced out of the matrimonial home, that person should be rehoused in an area of similar amenity and with a length of tenancy—or a " points total", depending on the local authority system—similar to that which would have been enjoyed by the entitled spouse or by the person who was the tenant at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is unsatisfactory to leave the provision unamended. The Minister has managed to give the impression that he is unsympathetic to people in such a position. I hope that that is not his final thought on the matter. I believe that local authorities have a duty to consider such people sympathetically. If we invite them to make moral judgments on people in such a predicament, it could result in an extremely difficult situation because clause 4 is drawn broadly. Conduct which may qualify under clause 4 on the ground that it has a genuine effect upon, say, the mental health of the spouse, is not necessarily conduct which in itself should attract moral condemnation or a form of moral turpitude. It may be that people are just getting on each other's nerves. That is a fact that the court must take into account when considering making an exclusion order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I believe that it would be unfortunate if the Minister gave the impression that he was happily acquiescing in a local authority which did not consider that any priority should be given to a spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the four categories of priority that the Minister mentioned, does he say that it would be incompetent to treat a spouse as a priority under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977? If that is what he is saying, the situation is somewhat goony because it is unlikely that such an individual would fit into any of those four categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps local authorities would be more sympathetic towards a marriage break-up under the normal lettings regulations, to which I have referred, rather than under the 1977 Act. Perhaps the Minister will be a little more forthcoming about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to suggest that the mere existence of an exclusion order should mean that a local authority should make no attempt to house the person concerned. I intended to convey that I could not accept what appeared to be the opposite case. The hon. Gentleman said that the existence of an exclusion should itself imply a priority need for alternative accommodation being made available. I emphasise that one has to consider the circumstances of each case. I would certainly accept that, even if a priority need could not be identified, there would be nothing to stop the local authority considering the application in the same way as it would consider any other application made in similar circumstances. That would be for the local authority to decide in accordance with its normal letting requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sets out clearly the rules for corroboration for the purposes of breaches of interdict or, indeed, of any other criminal proceedings that may arise from the Bill. It is important that the rules should be clearly stated, because often in matrimonial disputes—even matrimonial disputes that do not reach the court—there are at least two sides to the story. If the rules of acceptability of evidence and the rules of corroboration are stated clearly in the statute, the work of the courts will be made easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording that I have used is substantially the same as that in the Scottish Law Commission's memorandum 46 on the law of evidence. The memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"Evidential facts which individually establish nothing essential, but from which in conjunction with other evidential facts, a crucial fact may be inferred, and the evidence of a single witness is sufficient proof of each fact which is used in this way."</p></q>

The Scottish Law Commission did not suggest that there was any need for a statutory definition. It merely stated in its memorandum what it understood the law of corroboration to be. I have no reason to disagree with the general approach in the hon.

The hon. Gentleman's concern is not whether the general public understand the law of corroboration; it is that the police, who have to implement legislation, should be fully aware of what corroboration involves. The police are already given clear in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
structions about what is involved in the law of corroboration. Together with my noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate I will certainly consider whether, in terms of the application of this legislation, particular advice should be given to the police to ensure that they are aware of the details of the Scottish law of corroboration. I would not, however, think it appropriate to put in statutory form a matter that is already adequately dealt with in the common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the amendment that the hon. Gentleman does not object to the law of corroboration. His only concern is that it may not be fully understood. That concern can be accommodated as I have suggested. It would not be appropriate to write a definition of corroboration into one particular statute when corroboration is relevant to the whole spectrum of criminal law. The law Commission did not suggest that that should be done. Any statutory definition would have to be in respect of all criminal matters, not simply in respect of the Bill. I do not believe that such a definition is necessary. But we undertake to include in the advice that will be given to the police on the application of the Bill such advice as may be appropriate on the question of the level of corroboration legally required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I don ot imagine that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) will wish to press his new clause too far. I have some sympathy with the general point made by the Under-Secretary about the appropriateness of the new clause in this setting. But one or two points arise from it, and perhaps the Under-Secretary for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) may, even at this late stage, emerge to give us the benefit of his tongue. It may be, Mr. Henderson, that he is reserving his eloquence for the vote of thanks to the Chair at the end. Ministers are not put on Committees for no purpose, and we are all looking forward to seeing him break his duck before the end of the evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire was right to table this new clause. It is quite an important new clause, but what lies behind it is more substantial than the wording appears to recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even at this late hour, we should recognise why there is so much concern about corroboration. A large number of responsible organisations in touch with the victims of matrimonial violence do not think the present law of corroboration—however it may be defined and stated—is fair and workable. They say, understandably, that the nature of the matrimonial assault means that corroboration will not be readily available. The complaner—the woman who has been assaulted—may have not witnesses, unless there are children present—and often they are young children who are not suitable as witnesses. It is unlikely that the husband will make the mistake of bumping her one in a crowded public place. Even if there are visible marks, or if she makes a de recenti statement accusing her husband, that may not in itself be corroboration. The marks and the injury may be corroboration of the fact than an assault

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
has taken place but they may not corroborate the fact that it was the husband who made the assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking with experts grinning at me from the Conservative Benches but, as I understand it, the de recenti statement may amount to a buttress of the credibility of the complainer. Although her credibility may not be in question—and she may be a patently honest witness— her testimony is not in itself enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem. It means that in a large number of cases in which evidently—but not evidentially—an assault has been committed on a wife by her husband, it is impossible for the procurator fiscal to take proceedings because there is not sufficient corroboration, and he must have a prima facie case. If all the evidence is accepted, it is sufficient to prove the facts to obtain a conviction; but, without that, the procurator fiscal may have to write " No proceedings " across the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of women's organisations have talked to me about the problem on numerous occasions, and I recognise that their concern is deep and genuine. That is what lies behind my hon. Friend's anxiety about the definition of corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having expressed my sympathy, as so often happens I have to say that I cannot see any answer to the problem. I may be a prisoner of my own prejudices here. I am—or used to be—a solicitor of sorts. That may have made me too conservative in my approach to the problem. But I think that it is difficult and dangerous to say that in one area of criminal activity we should relax the laws of corroboration. I recognise that there are semi-precedents—not necessarily in the criminal law— in reparation cases where the evidence of one witness is sufficient. But those are civil proceedings and somewhat different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the so-called shining and extraordinary precedent of section 22 of the Road Traffic Act where the evidence of a single policeman is sufficient to prove that a motorist has gone through a red traffic light. Apart from that, we are down to the small change of traffic wardens which I think was covered by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So at the moment we have held firmly in Scotland that in all important areas of criminal law corroboration is essential. It is right that we should mention the basis of that concern and recognise how real that concern is. I do not think that it is possible to depart from the laws of corroboration. I am consoled in reaching that conclusion by the fact that if we can make the interdict proceedings in this legislation work and get the police to enforce the interdict, we are doing something to give a real protection where protection was perhaps inadequate in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might do something—I recognise that it is not necessarily the complete answer—to overcome the difficulties of protection. It is protection that we should be interested in—not vengeance in terms of a criminal conviction for protection for the spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
It is sometimes difficult because of the present laws of corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the civil machinery we have set up in the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill, despite the occasional appearances of deus ex machina of the procurator fiscal, will do something to remove the substantial difficulties that the strict but, I fear, necessary enforcement of the law of corroboration has brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in drafting his new clause my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire has said:
	<br><q><p>"corroboration of the crucial facts relating to a breach of interdict or in any criminal proceedings "</p></q>
I am not sure that the standard of proof in both those ought to be the same. The breach of interdict is presumably civil proceedings where a civil standard of proof would apply, and therefore it would be unfortunate if the two were linked in this way. It would enforce upon the civil courts a standard of proof which it would be unreasonable to ask them to meet and would be almost unprecedented in civil procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am glad that my hon. Friend tabled the new clause—it raises genuine matters worthy of debate and I hope that some points will be met by the procedure we are introducing in the legislation— I fear that a change in the law of corroboration would not make much sense at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I decide whether to press the new clause to a vote, can the Minister clarify one point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the new clause relax the existing law and regulations on corroboration, or would it simply restate in statute the status quo on corrobation in common law? If it is the latter, the new clause is unnecessary. If the Under-Secretary gives a commitment to offer the appropriate advice to the procurator, fiscal, the police, or whatever authorities are involved, I should be willing to withdraw my new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
