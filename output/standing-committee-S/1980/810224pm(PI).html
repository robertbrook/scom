I hope that the fact that the amendment is very long will not greatly depress members of the Committee. Despite its length, it is quite simple in intent. Indeed, those who were not aware of that intent and started to read it and compare the new section 89 contained in it with the existing provision in section 89 and in schedule 5 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966 probably wondered when the differences would appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would write into the Bill a new definition of overcrowding. Overcrowding has always been on the statute book, but, in the view of a number of interested organisations, it has long been in need of updating. As I understand it, the original definition which appears in schedule 5 dates back to 1935. Even someone as old and grey as I cannot remember 1935.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear to be something of an academic argument. In many ways the standard of overcrowding laid down in the Act is ignored by many local authorities —not through any fault of their own; I am sure that every local authority would like to eliminate overcrowding. But there is a realisation that the present stringency on local government finance means that there is a long road in front of most urban local authorities before they meet the standards laid down in schedule 5 of the 1966 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might be asked why I should be artificially raising this matter and putting the elimination of overcrowding beyond reach. The answer is that we ought to have standards which are realistic, but realistic not only in terms of their immediate achievement but in people's expectations of decent, minimum standards for which, as a society, we ought to aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it would help the Committee if I became involved in arguments about local government finance. But we all ought to assent to the proposition that I have just stated and at least be in favour of making progress towards a reasonable definition of overcrowding. There would be considerable moral purpose in doing so, and it would be an incentive both to central and local government to try to make progress in this thoroughly desirable direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain penal provisions on statute which deal with overcrowding. The fine, which is currently £1, will obviously not frighten anyone. I am not thinking in terms of penal sanctions for situations in which the standards are not met. But I think it is important that we set our sights on something that we ought to be striving to achieve. Therefore, the changes embodied in this amendment are thoroughly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Schedule 5 and annex, the accommodation is described in terms of rooms in a house. We are now working on bedrooms and this would bring the statutory definition of overcrowding into line with that of most local authorities. I take Glasgow as an example, with which I am most familiar, and I am sure it is no different from most of its major colleagues in the local authority housing field. When defining overcrowding, they leave the living room of the house aside and lay down rules which give bonus points because of overcrowding. For example, they assume that two children under 10 can share one bedroom but if they are of different sexes or over 10 they cannot share a bedroom. An adult over 18 is expected to have his or her own bedroom; and so on. On that basis, in terms of the bedroom accommodation of the house, they calculate what is a reasonable standard to meet. If one is a room short, one gets 30
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>617</span>
points; if one is two rooms short, one gets 30 plus 35 points; and if one is three rooms short, one gets up to 100 extra points when it comes to allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a straightforward and sensible recognition of the fact that if one is looking at overcrowding, it is sleeping accommodation which is the easiest and most efficient indicator of what the standard should be. We are suggesting that that system might be followed by statute in laying down the standards to which the 1966 Act refers. That is a straightforward point and I do not want to labour it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am indebted to Shelter, which points out that a change is necessary because the existing standard in no way represents current expectations. I give two examples. A family of five—husband, wife, two children of 8 and 6, and a baby of 6 months—living in a two-apartment dwelling, would not be deemed to be overcrowded. A family of six—husband, wife, adult daughter, teenage son, and two children of 9 and 5—living in a three-apartment dwelling would not be deemed to be overcrowded. That situation is clearly unsatisfactory and comes from the arbitrary decision which takes the number of apartments in the house and assumes that they are all sleeping apartments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that many Scottish families are in the situation where the settee has to become a double bed and the members of the family who are going to occupy it cannot go to bed until the television set has finally gone dead and all members have retired to what space there is in the rest of the house. That is not a living arrangement which any of us would consider ideal and I do not think it is an assumption that should be built into a statutory definition of overcrowding. I believe we are justified in excluding the living-room from the calculations and dealing with the floor area of the bedrooms and with the number of bedrooms in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change will not revolutionise the Scottish housing scene—its impact will probably be modest for a considerable time—but this is a convenient opportunity to raise our standards. I think the proposal is worth discussion and I hope that the Minister's response will be sympathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 129 deals with overcrowding and seeks to replace the standard of the number of rooms by a standard of the number of bedrooms. Particular kinds of bedrooms are defined and a specific number of points is allocated, depending on the size of the room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complexity of the amendment indicates the difficulty of that approach. I think that before one considered such an amendment, one would have to be convinced that it would lead to substantial practical benefit for the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1935 Act and the two subsequent Acts, which were consolidation measures concerned with these issues, provide a statutory basis, but there is at the moment nothing that prevents a local authority applying any extra criteria or subjective approaches to such matters that it thinks appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a twofold difficulty in the approach proposed by the hon. Gentleman. First, it makes no allowance for, for example, the considerable number of bed-sitting rooms, where the person concerned may have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>618</span>
a one-roomed house which is deliberately designed to be used as both a living room and a bedroom. That is not just a minor point. It involves a whole class of housing to which the approach the hon. Gentleman has suggested would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major factor however is that while the number of bedrooms may be a useful indication of the level of overcrowding in particular premises, it is not necessarily the most accurate guide. It seems to me far more sensible to look at the overall accommodation and relate that to the number of people living there. The way in which the tenant of the property chooses to use the rooms will vary from family to family. If we are talking about statutory criteria, it seems to me to be unnecessarily rigid to assume from the outset that particular rooms must be identified as either bedrooms or other rooms when there may be no physical, visible difference between a room which in the past has been used as a bedroom and one used for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter is right to draw attention to the fact that the standards were laid down in 1935. There may be an argument for looking at the whole question of overcrowding, and how the provisions have operated, but amendment No. 129 merely takes one aspect of the 1935 situation and seeks to change the statutory basis on which it is provided. That seems a rather artificial attempt at improvement—although I do not say that it was intended to be so. It is an artificial change in designation that would make not the slightest difference to a local authority's capacity to deal with the problems of overcrowding. The hon. Gentleman has rightly pointed out that even with the very narrow definitions of the 1935 Act, local authorities have not sought to enforce these standards, because they have often been incapable of doing so for reasons that are known to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see that amendment No. 129 would be any more likely to influence a local authority's behaviour. We should be wary of making cosmetic changes which have no significant effect on the problem of overcrowding. But my main proposition is that it is on balance more sensible to look at the overall accommodation in the property rather than to seek to define in advance whether it has X or Y number of bedrooms, which assumes a rigid approach to the use of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, while I think Shelter is right to indicate that we could usefully look at the whole provisions, I do not believe that a change such as this would be of any significant benefit to those living in overcrowded accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I appreciate some of the points made by the Under-Secretary, but I do not find them wholly convincing. I appreciate that under section 88 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966 it is
	<br><q><p>"the duty of a local authority to inspect districts and to make reports and proposals as to overcrowding."</p></q>
Section 89 gives the definition of overcrowding. One of the sad aspects of local government in Scotland, and housing policy over the years under all Governments, is that we have never been able to provide the resources that would allow the local authorities to meet the definitions on overcrowding.

4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, Mr. Gourlay, you go into any local authority area in Scotland—certainly in my constituency; I can think of scores of examples, and every week every surgery produces more—you will find that there are families in three-room or four-room apartments who patently ought to be in five-room or six-room apartments, where the overcrowding is such that normal family life is extremely difficult. I know of three-room houses with six or eight people in them, with families of mixed sex and mixed age. There is a sardine situation which must lead to all sorts of tensions, and that is in the public sector where the landlord is the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently if one is seeking to police the private sector I suppose it is the pot calling the kettle black, and one could say that double standards are being applied. Many of the properties turned up by such an inspection by the local authority would be its own. That is a tragic situation for which all in society must take some share of the responsibility. I appreciate that there are many practical difficulties, but I still believe that it is a fair point that the standard of overcrowding which was laid down in 1935, which presumably local authorities and landlords in the private sector would like to aim for, is a thoroughly unsatisfactory standard on which to judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to harp on the examples which I gave* and although I could spend a great deal of time expanding on them we have reached the point where there is little to be gained by giving copious examples. I stress that there are many cases of overcrowding which are painful and difficult. More importantly, there are cases where the ostensible standard of the present 1966 Act has been met but where undoubtedly all of us would consider the situation totally unsatisfactory. That is the point. It is not the cases which fall below the 1966 standard, but those which meet that standard and still have families in overcrowded accommodation. That situation results in pressure and a total destruction of privacy but there is no statutory commitment to do something about it. I gave two specific examples of accommodation in which none of us would like to put our families, but which meet the standards laid down by the 1966 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's arguments, apart from the fact that it would be impossible to make much impact because the problem was so intractable and because of the difficulties of finance in both the private and public sectors, hold out no early hope of widespread remedial action. Apart from that, the Minister said that he thought that it was wrong to make a distinction between sleeping accommodation and accommodation as a general concept. I agree that there are many families who use what I normally regard as living accommodation not just as sleeping accommodation but as dormitory accommodation perforce during the course of the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what I said. That position is not satisfactory. I would much prefer that we should update the standard and do it on a sleeping space basis. In other words, we should say that for all houses with more than one room, or in all houses apart from the bed-sit., which is a special situation usually in a tower block and designed for one old person, where there is a bedroom and living room the living room should be taken 	<i>per se</i> as a necessity. The overcrowding standard
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
should be based on the number of sleeping berths—if I may so define it—or the sleeping accommodation available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Table I of the amendment states in part
	<br><q><p>"Where a house consists of—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) One bedroom."</p></q>
That could easily be amended and a new category included for the bedsitting room, for which the overcrowding standard would be two persons. That could be easily and simply done. That objection does not seem to strike at the heart of what the amendment attempts. It would be much better to have an amendment along those lines and accept the general point embodied in it that we should consider the floor area of the bedrooms and the number of bedrooms when setting overcrowding standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying, "We have not achieved what we would have liked in this respect, which is the reason for not raising the standards to what we consider to be a reasonable level", he is arguing for a repeal of schedule 5 of the 1966 Act and stating "This is a hopeless fight. Let's give up." There is a case for saying that, if one embraces wholeheartedly the new doctrine of the Conservative Party as put out by the Secretary of State for Trade recently on television—the new pragmatism that we hear of, where one does what is convenient and expedient in the short term even if it is thought wrong. But that is not an attitude that we would want to take on Scottish housing policy, wherever else it may be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee is united, as I believe it is, in saying that schedule 5 has a place—in other words, that there ought to be standards of overcrowding and the action to define them—there is no case for not having an adequate definition and updating it every 45 years. It is not exactly a headlong pace or the giddy flight of progress. We are looking at this matter after 45 years and deciding, rightly, I think, that the set of stipulations appearing in schedule 5 is not in itself satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is clear. The only substantial argument was that of the bed-sitting room, and I have not set my mind to the problem of drafting an amendment to the amendment to cover that. But I am satisfied that it could be done, and if it can be done rather painstakingly and haltingly by me it can be done in the proverbial jiffy— by the standards of normal drafting exercises—by the Under-Secretary's advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister not to make sympathetic noises about Shelter being right to raise the issue, although I must admit that it was drawn to my attention by that organisation. There is more to it than being right to raise the issue. Shelter was right to ask that the point be pressed warmly upon the Minister. If his only objection is the one-apartment house designed specifically for a couple, that can be easily met. I hope that he will look more carefully at this proposition and consider whether we should be updating this set of definitions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been singularly unhelpful on this matter. We all understand why. The Government do not have a housing policy, or the machinery that could have been used, about which the Minister made polite sympathetic noises, because it is being dismantled. I am thinking of the Scottish Housing Advisory Council, for example, or housing plans which the hon. Gentleman is busily trying to dismantle. There is no good, therefore, in his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>621</span>
making polite, sympathetic noises because one of his ex-sponsoring organisations, like Shelter, has suggested this measure and everyone wants to make sympathetic sounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a need to consider this, will the hon. Gentleman at least give the Opposition an idea of what kind of machinery he would use? The bed-sitting room idea is nonsense. That is not the problem. For the Minister to suggest that to look at it would be embarrassing is farcical. He does not know what kind of houses we are talking about. I wonder how many houses there are in Drumchapel or Garscadden with a morning room, a dining room, a study, a library or anything other than a bedroom. Surely we should know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may reply that the Labour Government neglected this as well. Nevertheless, we should be told how much overcrowding there is in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister go a little further and say that the Government will examine the problem and come forward with recommendations that make sense for housing legislation in the future? That would bring up to date our understanding of what is meant by overcrowding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government have no interest in improving the standard of provision for working class people in those houses.

The degree of overcrowding is immeasurable. We do not have the statistics to show the degree of overcrowding in Scottish public sector housing. My hon. Friend is baying for the moon when he asks the Government to do anything about it in the foreseeable future.

behalf. The hon. Gentleman is right that we should watch what people do rather than listen to what they say. On that basis we should examine the attitude of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) when he was the Minister with responsibility for housing and had to deal with the matter. We can examine the attitude of the previous Labour Government, and the Labour Government before that and the one before that, right back to 1935. Let us agree with the hon. Member for Fife, Central to use the criterion not of what he says— he says many things—but of what he and his colleagues actually did when they had the opportunity to put their thoughts into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applying the hon. Gentleman's analogy to the amendment, we should be interested not only in what the Bill says but in what it will do, the difference that it will make to the problems of overcrowding. That is the criterion that the hon. Gentleman has invited the Committee to apply. We are not looking for a cosmetic improvement, a change in words, but a change in consequences. I have told the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that because his amendment refers to
	<br><q><p>"a room designed for providing sleeping accommodation"</p></q>
it seeks to prejudge. That is an inevitable consequence of such an amendment. It seeks not to determine the actual degree of overcrowding within particular properties, but to apply a rigid formula irrespective of the use to which people put the properties that they occupy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that the vast majority of public sector houses are relatively small, with not more than one other public room in addition to the bedrooms. However, we are talking not only about overcrowding where there may be one or two children, but about some premises where there may be eight, nine or 10 children, and more than one public room. When we are deciding on the degree of overcrowding, it is foolish to apply the rigid criteria which were rejected, not only in 1935, but also when the legislation was updated during the terms of two subsequent Labour Governments over the consequential 45 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we are prepared, as all Governments are, to look continually to see whether the criteria can be changed. The hon. Member for Fife, Central knows that the amendment would not make any difference to a single person living in overcrowded accommodation. He seems to be concerned with a cosmetic change rather than with anything that would make a difference to the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significantly, local authorities have not asked for such a change, and they are the people who have to implement the consequences of it. But such a request has not come from Labour or any other local authorities nor from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Gentlemen are concerned about this issue, I am willing to consider whether the 1935 criteria should be changed and whether it would produce any practical benefit to do so. On this amendment, my view at the moment is that when we are looking at overcrowding, it is more sensible to look at the overall accommodation that the property has—the total number of rooms— rather than at the number of rooms that might originally

have been designed for sleeping accommodation. That seems to be an artificial approach, and at this stage I am not convinced that the proposed change would lead to a significant improvement. I will consider the points that have been raised during this debate, but at this stage I cannot recommend this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the Minister, but he has not been very warm and forthcoming, even in his second effort. However, he was a little less frigid and a little less glacial, and I think we must be satisfied with that for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult area, and I accept that the standard we are applying, for the reasons we all agree, has not been applied in the past. If we look at section 90, the penal sanction—the fine not exceeding 20 shillings— has never been operated. It was to operate after an appointed day and, to the best of my knowledge, the appointed day has not come. I do not suppose the Minister has any intention of reaching the appointed day. It would be difficult to introduce this, given the state of the public housing sector, which is likely to deteriorate because of the cuts that are being imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is perhaps not something of importance for tomorrow, but I think it is important in the longer term that we get the standards right and that we get an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point that amendments of this kind may not be ideal and may not be exactly the right approach. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is right that we should not be upgrading in terms of bedroom space. Perhaps that is too rigid. He may be right that we should stay with the total area of the house. But in that case we should be looking at the standards in schedule 5, particularly table 2, trying to raise them and ensuring that the floor areas concerned are amended to eliminate the abuses which still fall short of this inadequate definition of overcrowding with which we have been living for a long time. Perhaps the Minister had the best of the argument, and, if he was trying to find a solution that reached the right result by a different method, the Opposition would be very happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take what we can from the debate. I note that the Minister said that his view "at the moment" is that there is no case for this amendment. He said he is prepared to look at this, and I am sure he is as good as his word. I am sure that when he looks at it, by whatever method he approaches it, he will accept that if there are to be definitions there is a strong case for bringing them into line with current expectations and the kind of practices that we would want to encourage and the decent housing standards that any civilised society ought to be able to boast. If we believe we should move in that direction, schedule 5 will have to be amended on one basis or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will look at this and let us know his conclusions in the near future. I shall adopt the "at the moment" phrase and say that at the moment I am prepared to recommend to the Committee that this amendment be withdrawn. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"if the Secretary of States does not restore to a local authority under sub-paragraph (a) above the amount by which an element of rate support grant payable to that local authority has been reduced or restores such amount in part only he shall."</p></q>
This is an important amendment and deals with an area of some controversy. In some ways, it deals with a part of schedule 3 which is directly connected to clause 13 and to section 5 of the 1966 Act. We are back in the centre of the controversy, and the reason why the Bill has taken a rather substantial time in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather strangely, in paragraph 8 of schedule 3, certain provisions relate to what happens if, sadly, a Secretary of State decides that there has been unnecessary and excessive expenditure and therefore makes a deduction in the rate support grant of a local authority. Strangely enough—I make this point only in passing— we have had some representations, with which I have some sympathy, that this paragraph could advantageously have been added to clause 13 so that the whole machinery of deduction was placed together and a total picture resulted. One or two people have said to me— I am referring to officials and finance departments— that they had failed to notice paragraph 8 of schedule 3, hiding coyly as it does in the minutiae of minor and consequential amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the first subparagraph of paragraph 8 is unexceptionable. Although we dislike the machinery, given that it has survived so far, we must accept that it is probably reasonable to have new section 5A(1). It says that where there has been a reduction from the rate support grant in terms of section 5 of the 1966 Act, the local authority may have some or all of that reduction restored to it if its conduct is such as to merit such restoration. This takes us back to the objectionable principle built into clause 13 that deduction and repayment or partial repayment is totally at the whim of the Secretary of State and that he alone decides what merits restoration and what does not. We do not like that aspect of it. It is an arbitrary and, I believe, dictatorial power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we are to have the first consequence— that is, the cut—we cannot object to this machinery following from it. I do not think it practical to suggest some sort of outside arbitration, as that would be a foreign importation. It would become even more objectionable, if there were no machinery for restoration, if some sort of modus vivendi were worked out between the Secretary of State and the sinning local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this amendment deals with a situation in which there has not been restoration to the individual local authority or in which there has only been partial restoration. New section 	<i>5A(l)(b)</i> says that if there is a clawback, a pool of finance that has been removed from a local authority's rate support grant under clause 13, it is up to the Secretary of State whether that is kept in his back pocket, in his little piggy bank, or whether it is restored or redistributed to the other local authorities which have been sharing the rate support grant total. This is left entirely on a discretionary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 123—I do not think that there is anything very wrong with its drafting, because it is a straightforward narrative of which the intent is clear—is to make it mandatory on the Secretary of State to distribute to other local authorities according
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>625</span>
to whatever formula seems right, money that he has clawed back from one individual defaulting authority. That seems to me to be an important principle and one on which we ought to insist in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard time and again from the Under-Secretary that he is not necessarily worried about the distribution within the totality of local authority expenditure. What he is very worried about is the local authority that is overspending, with the result that the total of local authority expenditure gets out of hand and runs away beyond the nice checks and balances and the neat mathematical divisions and arithmetical calculations of his ministerial colleagues in the Treasury. The theory is that to ensure that that does not happen, he introduces this penal sanction of clawing back from any local authority in that situation or threatening to put itself in that situation through excessive and unreasonable estimates, money which it would otherwise have had to spend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed before the logic of that Gilbertian situation. The Under-Secretary knows that we have considerable contempt and dislike for this exercise. But, on the assumption that it will take place, surely, if we apply the Secretary of State's own logic, it would be very wrong if the totality of local government expenditure were to be cut because of the sins of one local authority. I can see the argument that local authorities should not be allowed to overspend, but why should the total local authority expenditure be reduced and local authority services overall suffer as a result of one authority's sins? I should have thought that, even if we accept that clause 13 should exist, the Secretary of State's interests and this whole heavy-handed, Star Chamber-type of manoeuvre were to ensure that the totality of local government spending stayed where it ought to stay and where he estimated it would be when he drew up his global total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that that happens, the obvious and logical thing to do is to say that we shall fine local authority X, because of its excessive and unreasonable conduct and its devotion to good and adequate public services, but we shall not as a result deprive the entire local authority world of that cash and put it into our pockets as a bonus. We shall ensure that it is redistributed among the other authorities, which at least will ensure that the public spending total is as we estimate it. At the same time the public, unfortunately not in the area which has been singled out for penal sanctions but at least the general public of Scotland, will have the benefit of that expenditure and will be able to ensure that it is translated into bricks and mortar, caring services and education facilities or whatever it was originally envisaged we could afford when the global totals were set by the Secretary of State, the Treasury mandarins or whoever calls the tune in the intricate and labyrinthine world of Government administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a simple and straightforward amendment. As I said, I do not think that the Secretary of State should benefit as a result of clause 13. If it is to be a penal clause, it should be penal in the sense of changing the distribution of an agreed total. It should not be a means of reducing that total and thus penalising the whole local government system. I hope that the amendment will commend itself to my hon. Friend's and also, although I say this with a little less confidence, to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>626</span>
Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, it is certainly possible for the Secretary of State, if he has withdrawn grant from an individual authority, to redistribute that grant in certain circumstances among other authorities. The hon. Gentleman's amendment, however, would remove that element of discretion and make it a mandatory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that the amendment for the following straightforward reason. The hon. Gentleman correctly points out that the Secretary of State is concerned with the aggregate of total expenditure. If the expenditure of all the other local authorities is already at a level which the Secretary of State thinks is the maximum in the national interest, it would be very foolish for the Secretary of State, having taken £X million from one authority, to give it to other authorities, thereby pushing them above the level that he thinks appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be special circumstances in which other authorities' expenditure is considerably below the level which is considered the maximum appropriate. There may, therefore, be circumstances in which a redistribution is appropriate. But to say that that must happen in all cases is to defeat the whole purpose of the exercise. If the actions of one authority are pushing the aggregate of all local authority expenditure £X million above the recommended total, to take £X million from that authority and give it to other authorities will not change the aggregate. The aggregate will remain the same amount above that considered appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, and it may be that I have misunderstood the situation, or perhaps the Minister is misunderstanding what I am saying. As I understand it, a local authority's estimates are produced before the start of a financial year—probably in the February before the March—and in the view of the Secretary of State those estimates are seen to be excessive and unreasonable. At that stage, he decides upon a deduction from the rate support grant which he would have given to that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That rate support grant is what the authority would have received and what the Secretary of State would have been willing to pay it if he did not think that the authority was about to overspend above it. Does the Minister follow me? Surely, therefore, as a result the total rate support grant that the Secretary of State would have been prepared to spend will be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an example in round figures, the Treasury might decide that local authorities in Scotland could be allowed a total rate support grant of £2,000 million. If the Secretary of State decided that region X was preparing to overspend—to spend its entitlement under the rate support grant plus a whole lot of money that it intended to raise by rates, let us say—and if the authority was prepared to overspend what the Secretary of State thought reasonable under the guidelines, he would knock £200 million off what he would have paid it. I give those figures for the sake of argument—the sum would not be as large as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of £2,000 million, the total figure for the rate support grant in Scotland would be £1,800 million—in other words, £200 million less than the Secretary of

State was originally prepared to allow. Is that the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the position, because the hon. Gentleman is confusing the total of rate support grant with the total of expenditure by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of national public expenditure, the Secretary of State is concerned not with the total of rate support grant which local authorities receive throughout Scotland, but with the grand total of their expenditure. The total of rate support grant might be, say, £2,000 million, and the total of all local authority expenditure—the maximum that the Secretary of State considers appropriate in the national interest—£3,000 million, of which £2,000 million is to be provided by rate support grant. If the budgets of all the local authorities—using simple figures again—add up to £3,100 million, because one local authority is proposing to spend £100 million more than it should, and if the Secretary of State simply takes £100 million off its rate support grant and gives it as an additional grant to the other local authorities which have already fixed their budgets, and have not anticipated the increase, the only point in giving it to them would be to enable them to increase their spending. The only way that they could increase the spending would be to go above the level, back to the figure of £3,100 million—unless they put that sum into their savings and did not use it, which would be a pointless exercise from everyone's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the money is to be useful to local authorities, it is to supplement the income for which they have already budgeted and rated. It would be of no benefit to them if they could not spend extra cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position with the resources element is quite different. There must be redistribution in the resources element, because a local authority, by pushing up its spending, receives increased resources element at the expense of other authorities. But a local authority does not receive an increased needs element by increasing its spending. Therefore, the automatic need for redistribution does not follow, and would, indeed, be counterproductive for the reasons that I have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should surely be appropriate that there is discretion for the Secretary of State to redistribute, because there may be circumstances in which that would not jeopardise the total overall spending. To make the redistribution mandatory would be to put the Secretary of State in the impossible position of having acted in order to mainain the aggregate at the level he feels appropriate, but of then having to redistribute the amount saved on RSG, thus keeping the total at the figure from which he is trying to reduce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That position could clearly not be accepted by the Secretary of State. I hope that the hon. Member will now appreciate why it would be inappropriate to make a mandatory provision as his amendment suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never entirely understood why the revenue raised on the rates by a local authority needs to be taken into account in the public sector calculations of the Secretary of State for Scotland or of the Treasury. After all, if I decide that 1 need to raise revenue as a local authority and I decide to do it by charging entrance fees to my museums, by charging extra money for school meals, or by doubling the cost of entering my swimming baths, that is getting revenue for my coffers, which I can then spend. Apparently that does not have any effect upon public sector finance considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if I decide to take money from the pockets of the population within my area by raising rates and not by additional charges, central Government have an interest in controlling that. That is a distinction which has never been entirely clear to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I take the point of the hon. Gentleman, but it is no different for local government than it is for central Government. If central Government provide a service for which they charge, that is not public expenditure. If, however, central Government tax the public in order to have money to spend on services, clearly that is public expenditure, because the people who are paying the money are not necessarily the people getting the services for which they have paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is paying for a service that he is receiving, that is not public expenditure. That person is paying as a citizen for the service he receives. But if a person is paying taxes, whether to a local authority or to central Government, for services provided for the community as a whole which may, or may not, include that person, whatever else it might be, it certainly is public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let us suppose that a region decides that it will have an extremely good pupil-teacher ratio and, in order to finance that, it decides to increase charges for school meals, for museums and for swimming baths. That is a means of getting revenue to finance that pupil-teacher ratio. It can do that without worrying the Secretary of State at all. If that region makes that decision and adds a ha'penny on the rates, which raises the same amount of money required and that money is used for exactly the same purpose, we must all worry about that

terribly. Apparently it is essential that authorities should be stopped from doing that, if that is what the Treasury wants. I have never been able to grasp or to follow that distinction.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain the distinction in this way. We are talking about public expenditure. That is simply expenditure by a public body. However, if a local authority has a swimming pool and it charges an economic fee for its use, the expenditure is being incurred not by the public body but by the user of the service. That is why, whatever else it might be, it is not public expenditure. It is private expenditure by an individual—albeit that he may be using a swimming pool which the local authority rather than a private concern has built. But it is not public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I read it correctly, there are two legs to the Government's economic policy. One is that they do not wish public expenditure to exceed a certain level, because that would require an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. The amount of revenue that can be raised is never sufficient to pay for services. That is one side of the argument. But the other side suggests that, in itself, public expenditure has to be regarded with some suspicion. It is that side of the argument which we are reaching now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implicit in the proposal is that a level of public expenditure is generated by local authorities regardless of where the money comes from to pay for it, and that that is unacceptable. That is the issue on which this legislation is being brought to bear. The Government will not allow anything outwith what they regard as an acceptable boundary, first, because they do not like an increase in public sector borrowing and, secondly, because it takes away money that could be used for private consumption, private industry and private enterprise. That is the other element which the Minister has been too coy to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that the Government's policy has two legs—which makes for a very unstable table! However, I do not believe that we should go any further with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that if someone runs a municipal enterprise, with a scale of charges which produces a large surplus that is then used to subsidise certain forms of public services, I cannot see how that can be excluded under the sort of arguments that the Government have used. However, I see that I am persuading no one but myself, so I shall leave that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that if the Government have budgeted for a specific amount of local government spending that is directly generated from their Exchequer—their purse— and then reduce that sum by penalising a local authority, there is a case for saying that the money should be redistributed. But as the Minister is adamantly against me, and because I have a kind heart—I see that the parliamentary representative of the Patronage Secretary is hard at work on his papers and I do not want to send him through the corridors like a demented sheepdog looking for his flock; I shall spare him that embarrassment and avoid the lengthy delay before the sheep arrive

The issue of admitting the press and public to meetings of new town development corporations has provoked something of a controversy in Cumbernauld and elsewhere; it has been mentioned in the Scottish press. In turn, that led to the Scottish Office making a statement, which said:
	<br><q><p>"It is up to the development corporation to hold their meetings as they see fit. There are no statutory provisions regarding new towns similar to those for local authorities."</p></q>
My amendment seeks to make a provision in the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968 which is identical to that in the Local Government (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a matter of principle involved. Those who live in new towns are entitled to know what is done in their name by the development corporations. As parliamentarians, we should deeply disapprove of secrecy, which leads to suspicion. It may often be unfounded, but it is a hindrance to the work of the corporations and detracts from the confidence that the public have in them. I believe that the failure to admit the press and public to development corporation meetings has contributed to that suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I was interested to note the comments made by one of my constituents, Mr. John Campbell of Condorrat in Cumbernauld, which were reported in the 19 February issue of 	<i>Cumbernauld News and Kilsyth Chronicle.</i> The report says that when he was questioned about whether the Cumbernauld development corporation had something to hide when it persisted in holding all board meetings in camera, he said:
	<br><q><p>"We supposedly live in a democratic society, but surely this cannot be the case with the CDC if they are trying to suppress the press."</p></q>
He is reported to have continued:
	<br><q><p>"My rent is now £82 per month. Surely I should be allowed to find out what they are doing with it."</p></q>
I believe that was absolutely right, because the powers of development corporations are considerable, they are very much local authorities and are not elected. That latter fact causes me concern, because I believe that they should at least be democratically accountable. The amendment seeks to extend the area of accountability.

That is the policy of the Labour Party, and I am sure that we shall come to that matter. However, for the moment I am concerned to obtain the entry of the press to their meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend with a good deal of sympathy. I believe that we are all prejudiced in favour of the amendment and what it seeks to achieve. Would my hon. Friend say a word or two about the meaning of the phrase in the amendment "so far as practicable"? What are the exceptions he envisages in the use of what is a key phrase?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strikes me that there might be an argument—it is not one with which I would necessarily go along— which said that when rent levels were being discussed, other problems of management, staff and so on could be woven into the fabric of a new town corporation meeting, which differs from a local authority committee structure, and make difficult the admission of the press or public. I presume that the phrase "so far as practicable" seeks to meet that point, but perhaps my hon. Friend will explain now he envisages that will operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that matter in a moment. I want to conclude my remarks about the fixing of rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that decisions of that importance to the lives of men and women in the new towns should be taken in camera. They should be taken openly so that people may know what are the arguments and, likewise, the decisions about the environment. The new town development corporations are important from the point of view of planning and organising the new towns, what the developments shall be, where houses shall be built and factories sited, and where parks, play areas, schools and so on shall be located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are immensely important decisions, and I want them to be taken out in the open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscad-den (Mr. Dewar) asked me to explain what was meant by the words "so far as practicable". Quite clearly, there are restrictions on the number of places available for members of the public and press to take seats in the halls and meeting places of the new town development corporations. They are in the same position as the district councils and the regional authorities. There are clearly physical limitations on the numbers that can be admitted to meetings, but the principle has always been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
met by the local authorities and provision has always been made to admit the press. They often have special places for the press to sit, as we do in this committee room, and likewise members of the public. All I am asking is that the development corporations should make the same provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way of getting round this would be for the development corporations to ask for the use of the local authority chambers in the places where they exist —Cumbernauld, for example. The facility would then be on the same footing as it is for the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have replied satisfactorily to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I entered into this controversy about the new town development corporations and the fact that some of them do not hold open meetings, I have been pleased by the extent of the public reaction. I think it is important for Conservative Members to note that I am supported, rather surprisingly, by the principal spokesman for the Conservative Party in Cumbernauld, likewise the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Party. It has been Labour Party policy for a long time that we should conduct the affairs of public bodies in the open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if it surprises members of the Committee that there is such widespread support. It is very important to the people in these communities. There is real anxiety that there should be open meetings of the development corporation. The Government had a lot to say before they were elected about open Government. This was to be the style of the Conservative Administration. I am asking them to go ahead—in a very limited way because we are only talking about five Scottish new town development corporations—and say to the development corporations "Yes. We think that you should admit the press and the public."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have said enough to convince the Minister, in view of the Scottish Office statement which I read earlier and which made it clear that there is no statutory provision. I want a statutory provision, because I want to underwrite the right of the communities in the five new towns to be present at meetings of the development corporations and to be able to read in their local newspapers debates that took place in the committees. I am convinced that this is right, and I hope the Minister will say that he is able to accept my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As the representative for Glenrothes new town, I welcome the amendment. When one looks back at the original legislation, one is surprised that this was not there when the new town corporations were set up. There must have been good reasons why it was not. Or perhaps the originators of that legislation thought that the discretion left to the development corporations was sufficient to meet the problem if it arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, I have had constant complaints from Glenrothes tenants whenever they met with a controversial decision made by the corporation. They have found it extremely difficult to find out who was on which side of an argument and how they voted. In fact, I believe the corporation goes to great trouble not to vote precisely because it is not accountable to the residents in the town for what it does. I believe I am right in saying that there is not even access to the minutes of meetings. Not only are the public excluded from the meetings but they do not have access to the records of the meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely correct, and that is a matter of contention in the new towns, because other local authority minutes are readily available in libraries and elsewhere to the public. I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that it is wrong that the minutes of development corporations which are spending money are not so available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether there is statutory provision for public access to the minutes of local authorities, but, if so, the amendment is defective in that that provision is not also included. However, that can be put right later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when, many years ago, Select Committees of the House were not open to the public. Neither press nor public were allowed in to Select Committees. For years, the House resisted access of the press and public to Select Committees. Great debates took place and, eventually, we gradually reached the position where the public and the press were allowed access to all Select Committees on the basis that when a Select Committee is dealing with matters which are of commercial interest to private firms, or whatever, the Committee itself decides whether to exclude the public. On that basis, the corporations could also do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the development corporations from time to time have to debate and decide on matters of commercial interest to incoming firms or to individual tenants of houses, and so on, but they are dealing with very large sums of public money and accountable to nobody who is directly affected by the decisions they make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how the Minister can resist the spirit of the amendment, if not the actual wording. Now that we are all conceding the desirability of extending the principle of open Government and more accountability, there is no conceivable reason why the Minister should not accept the principle of this amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) is a reasonable, moderate Member who has moved an amendment in a reasonable, moderate way. He is irresistible. My hon. Friend will score a magnificent victory tonight which will make headlines in next week's 	<i>Cumbernauld News.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one listening to the debate can doubt the educational value of allowing the public to listen to the debates of politicians. Those of us who were privileged to watch Lothian region Labour Party debating on television last night came to that conclusion. It was particularly educational to know that almost half the Labour group believed in cuts until outvoted by their colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) has done the Committee a service in outlining the concern felt by himself and his local community at the fact that for many of the matters of general public interest debated and discussed by new town development corporations, there is no access for the public. His hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) rightly pointed out that new town development corporations also considered matters of confidentiality and management considerations. Therefore, clearly it is appropriate to consider a scheme and a provision that would enable the genuinely confidential matters and management matters to be dealt with in private, as they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
have been in the past. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I should have made that clear. I missed the point when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made his intervention. Of course, there are matters concerning individual families, and so forth, just as there are in local authorities, which should be discussed in private. These must still be dealt with confidentially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming that. Perhaps it would be helpful if I explained to the Committee the present situation. Under existing law, the Secretary of State is already able to give a directive to the new town development corporations that would have the effect of requiring them to make their meetings open to the public. Under section 4(3) of the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1968, the Secretary of State may, after consulting the chairman of the corporation concerned, issue a direction to the corporation which would have the effect of requiring it to admit the press and public to meetings under the circumstances envisaged in the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960. It is also possible to make an order under section 2(3) of the 1960 Act to add anybody to the schedule to that Act. Therefore, one could by order have the effect that the hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks of adding that to the number of public bodies which require to make themselves available to the public and to the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see the force of what the hon. Gentleman has said and the desirability of a seeking some change in this direction. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State intends to have a meeting—it has already been fixed—-on 13 March with all the chairmen of the new town development corporations. It would be appropriate for a major item on the agenda to be to seek to obtain in a co-operative way from those corporations a revision of the arrangement that would enable matters of legitimate public interest to be available to the public and to the press in the way that the hon. Gentleman has indicated. We wish to hear from them any areas of concern that they might have about certain of the detailed implications that publicity would lead to. We shall start on the basis that there is no obvious objection to the principle of those matters of obvious public interest dealt with by the new town development corporations being witnessed by the public and press. Therefore, we wish to have proper consultation with the new towns to see whether this can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we have had the opportunity of hearing the chairmen's views—we have not yet had a chance to discover their reaction to the hon. Gentleman's amendment—it will be possible to decide whether a directive is necessary, as they may be only too happy to cooperate voluntarily in the way sought by the hon. Gentleman. Even if there were disagreement, the Secretary of State would have to give very serious consideration to whether the exercising of his existing powers would be appropriate to achieve a change of the kind sought by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister propose to that meeting that, in the light of what has taken

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I can tell the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend will indicate to the chairmen of the new town development corporations the strength of feeling of this Committee and that the Government see no objection in principle to opening up these matters of obvious public interest that in the case of a local authority would clearly lead to access to the public and to the press. We can at this stage see no objection in principle to a similar right being provided for similar types of issue if they are being discussed by a new town development corporation. We do not wish to come to a conclusion until we have had an opportunity of hearing from the new towns themselves. It would be discourteous of us not to give them an opportunity to comment on what the hon. Gentleman has proposed before we come to a conclusion. I am happy to say that we see no objection in principle to the sort of proposal that the hon. Gentleman has made in so far as it would ensure that matters which, if being dealt with by a local authority, would automatically lead to the public being present, had a similar consequence for new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment at this stage, my right hon. Friend is meeting the chairmen of the new towns on 13 March, and it will be his intention to discuss this issue at that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I associate the Opposition officially with my hon. Friend's amendment? I do not know what my hon. Friend will say, but I find what the Under-Secretary said to be helpful. There seems to be no reason why new town corporations which deal with such fundamental issues as housing and the structure and charging for housing, should not be open to public scrutiny in the same way as are local authorities which carry out a similar remit at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter perhaps of indifference whether this function is carried out under the 1968 Act or whether it is done by amendment to this Bill, as long as we achieve our objective. I appreciate that consultations on 13 March would make a lot of sense. I hope that we shall have a fairly positive reaction as a result of that meeting and that, if necessary—I put it no higher than this—the Under-Secretary will be able to return to the matter at a later stage of this Bill, because the timescale will clearly allow it. I hope that the Under-Secretary will make known the results of these consultations so that we may know whether this is something that we have to push or whether we can sit back knowing that the door has opened and that appropriate action will follow.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's statement is helpful. I hope that he and his right hon. Friend will do everything possible to persuade the chairmen of the new towns that this is a proper course of action for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: can state quite simply the reason the amendment has been tabled by quoting a letter that I received from Kirkcaldy district council. It is dated 9 February and reads:
	<br><q><p>"I have no doubt that you are fully aware of the problem which has arisen in this Authority regarding claims by Councillors who are not members of particular committees that they should be allowed to claim attendance for sitting in the public gallery as observers, while not participating in any way in the business of the meeting. The Authority, having received the Opinion of Counsel and a Statement of View by the Auditor that these claims were competent on the grounds that the Act did not define the quality of attendance required, raised the matter with COSLA and COSLA agreed to make representations for amendment of the law to clarify the position."</p></q>
I need not go into the merits of what Kirkcaldy district council did at the time, although I had my own reservations about it. But certain people felt aggrieved that they were not on committees after the May elections as they had been members beforehand. As a protest, they attended meetings as observers and claimed attendance allowance. The law on the matter is not especially clear, according to the legal advice given to the authority, and, having looked at the law in the relevant Act of 1973, I understand their difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to clarify the position to prevent councillors who are not elected or selected members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>638</span>
of committees attending as observers and claiming attendance allowance because, if that were allowed, clearly it would be wide open to abuse. Each member of a council could attend any meeting he wished and claim all kinds of attendance allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may not have the wording that meets the requirement, although we have been advised that it has. As a layman, I drafted another form of words, but I have accepted advice which is better than my judgment. Therefore, I move the amendment in the hope that it answers the problem posed by Kirkcaldy district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with much sympathy to my hon. Friend moving the amendment, because amendment No. 124, which I tabled, is couched in similar terms.

We are all aware of the unfortunate background to this becoming an issue, but we can separate that and do not need to go into the merits of it, although I personally take the view that as a normal principle there should be a fair reflection of the party split on an elected body in each of its constituent committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: have no intention of going too far into it. I was merely saying that we all know why it has become a public issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that, in any event, as a result of a debate that took place, and because of certain circumstances, it is clear that the present definition of an approved duty is not sufficiently watertight to give proper guidance to officials who have to administer and respond to claims. A general wish has been expressed by local authorities to members of the committee—it has been reflected by COSLA—that efforts should be made to establish precisely the circumstances in which there can be an attendance allowance for an approved duty. The suggestion is that it should be paid for attendance only at a committee to which the member has been appointed or which he has been otherwise authorised by the local authority to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple matter of clarification. We do not know the circumstances in which it may become a subject of dispute again. It seems sensible to take the obvious opportunity provided by a miscellaneous provisions Bill to tidy the matter up, so that everyone understands exactly when the attendance allowance can be claimed and what is an approved duty in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: assume that the Minister will respond sympathetically to our desire to define, or rather redefine, the circumstances in which an attendance allowance is attracted. I know that this is a bitty way of tackling the matter, but that is part and parcel of the type of Bill before us. The Minister will be aware that paragraph 242 of the Stodart committee report says:
	<br><q><p>"We agree that the present system of attendance allowances is inept and unsatisfactory."</p></q>
It seems appropriate to ask the hon. Gentleman to tell us whether there is any likelihood of our doing anything about some of the sound recommendations in that report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must not follow that red herring too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I intended to say, Mr. Gourlay, and, indeed, all that I can say is that my right hon. Friend will be responding to the Stodart Committee recommendations in the not too distant future—that may be the opportunity to discuss that matter further. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does indeed arise from the unfortunate situation of Kirkcaldy district council, with which you, Mr. Gourlay, are doubtless familiar. When considering later amendments, we shall have an opportunity to examine that matter. With regard to the entitlement to attendance allowance, there is no certainty at present that legislation is needed. I understand that an action is due to be heard before the sheriff court in March. It would be appropriate to await the outcome of that hearing before deciding whether there is a loophole that needs to be filled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the reasons that have led councillors in Kirkcaldy district to protest in the only way that they believe is available, because of the way in which the ruling group have acted. However, I certainly accept the argument of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that in terms of public policy it is highly undesirable that councillors should be able to claim an attendance allowance for sitting in as observers of a committee of which they are not members—to claim the allowance by virtue of mere attendance in the public gallery. It is by no means clear yet whether it is necessary to amend the law to achieve our purpose. There will be a ruling from the sheriff in March, and if that suggests that an amendment to the law is required, the Government will look sympathetically at the idea. We agree that to have a legal ruling enabling any councillor to claim an attendance allowance simply by sitting in the public gallery is unacceptable to the public. I hope that, in the light of that assurance, the hon, Gentleman will agree that his amendment is premature, and that we should await the sheriff's decision.

Kirkcaldy situation, I can assure the hon. Gentelman that if the court rules that a councillor can claim an attendance allowance for sitting in the public gallery to watch the proceedings of a committee of which he is not a member, that is unacceptable as a matter of Government policy, and we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the law is rectified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other circumstances, this could be a matter of contention. If it were held that a councillor's attendance in the public gallery as a member of the general public should not be taken as an approved duty, we would all agree with that. But to legislate to exclude that is not necessarily to do so on the basis of the amendment that we are debating, which seeks to restrict approved duties to attendance at those meetings
	<br><q><p>"to which a member has been appointed or otherwise authorised to attend by the body."</p></q>
In other words, there could be circumstances— although I cannot think of any at present—which fell far short of just sitting in the public gallery but which would still be outwith such a tightening definition. Will the Minister tell us whether he approves of the amendment's intention, rather than merely saying that he disapproves of certain actions—however much he may understand them—that are being taken in the context of Kirkcaldy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the effect of the court ruling is to suggest that an amendment of the law is required, we shall not necessarily restrict that to the specific matter of sitting in the public gallery. It may be appropriate to have a wider amendment, and the wording of the hon. Gentleman's amendment may turn out to be the most suitable way of proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at present there is no reason to assume that any amendment to the law is necessary. Nevertheless, that will be tested in the court. I should like to await the sheriff's judgment to see whether a change is required. Not only his decision but the basis on which he reaches it may be relevant in deciding the extent to which the law requires amending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying in any way to limit what might be an appropriate amendment, but I believe that it would be premature to come to a view until we know that there is a need to change the law. If the matter were not before the court, there might be an argument for an avoidance of doubt provision. However, it would be inappropriate to anticipate the sheriff's decision, particularly as we shall have an opportunity to make such an amendment if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have that opportunity provided that the judgment is not too long delayed. But he may have to wait a long time for a written judgment from the sheriff, who will have to consider all the pros and cons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that it is always better to wait for a sheriff's judgment. If there is a clear need for a tightening up, it is better for the Minister to tackle the problem head on in his Department with the benefit of advice fom his civil servants and after due consultation. Although it is for my hon. Friend to decide, I feel that we should leave the matter now, with the assurance that the Government are examining the problem, that they

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time that I spoke to one of my amendments I was subjected to some good-natured badinage from the Opposition because it was considered a rare phenomenon. I hope that they will welcome the fact that I have now had a burst of activity and tabled four amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be talking about a problem that has been indirectly referred to—the protection of minority rights, namely, those of oppositions in local authorities. The objective of the amendments is to ensure that minorities in Scottish local authorities receive rights that are roughly in accordance with the traditions of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there will always be arguments about the best balance of numbers between a governing party and the opposition on certain committees. It is important to say that following the May 1980 changeover in a large
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>642</span>
number of Scottish authorities there were no general problems in that respect. The great majority of incoming Labour authorities did not seek unreasonably to exclude minorities from their considerations. But there were problems in certain authorities. My hon. Friend may wish to refer to Dundee; I understand that there have also been complaints from the opposition in the Stirling district about their treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out, the position in Kirkcaldy district has highlighted the issue. What has happened there is an example of a problem that is so extreme that the Committee and the House should consider it. The facts are clear. From 1975 to 1980 the composition of the committees on that council reflected its make-up. Membership was allocated to various groups, and it was up to them to decide who should represent them. On Kirkcaldy council before May 1980 there were 16 Labour members, eight SNP, five Conservative, four Ratepayers Association, two Independent and one Communist member. By agreement, every party group received a chairmanship or vice-chairmanship of a committee. The committee places were allocated according to a clear formula: in a committee of 12, there were five Labour members, three SNP and four other members; in committees of nine, there were four Labour members, two SNP and three other members. The SNP and the others gave places from their category to the Communist, who was on at least two important committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After May 1980 the council's composition was: Labour 23, Independent—who was, in fact, the Communist; I suppose he could be described as an "Independent Communist"—1; and others 12. At the first meeting of the new council on 7 May 1980, Labour nominated the convener, the vice-convener, the chairman and the vice-chairman of all the council's committees. Those nominations, of course, went through without any opposition; it was accepted that there was a Labour administration. The opposition parties naturally assumed that as they had one-third of the councillors they would receive one-third of the places on the committees. However, the ruling Labour group announced that there would be no opposition representation on the policy and resources committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely the point that was made by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), that many people regard the policy and resources committee as a Cabinet, so to speak, and in a different category from the others. But the ruling group went on to say that there would be no minority representation on the housing committee, which resulted in the problem that we considered in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). That excluded the previous housing convener, who was a member of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee. I believe that the entire Committee will agree with me that that person is someone who is exceedingly knowledgeable about housing matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the other committees, the ruling group announced who the minority representatives would be. It excluded from a committee anyone who had previously been its chairman or vice-chairman— that is, knowledge and experience was a bar to membership of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a total of 159 committee places, and, taking the independent Communist with Labour, the others
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>643</span>
—that is, the SNP, Conservatives, Ratepayers and Independents—received 21 out of 159 places. Generally, committees did not meet frequently. For example, the two Independents were each given one place in a committee which has met once since May 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to speculate on what would happen in the House if the Kirkcaldy formula were followed, but the equivalent would be that my hon. Friend the Minister and my other hon. Friends would gather together to decide not only who could be the Conservative members of this Committee but who would be the occasional Labour member of it. Perhaps we would take an alphabetical list of Labour Members and start by excluding the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Adams) because he had been on Strathclyde regional council. We would come to the Bs and would certainly exclude the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), who has immense experience, with 10 years on Glasgow corporation, and who was a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those criteria I do not speculate on whom the Conservative group would put on the other side of the Committee. Perhaps there would be a representative of the Liberals, such as the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon), a constituency as far away from Scotland as is possible. However, that is a farcical and inconceivable prospect, because this House is based on consent and, above all things, on agreement on the rights of minorities and Opposition parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of what has happened in Kirkcaldy is that most decisions are delegated to committees and delegated decisions cannot be challenged in the council. Therefore, effectively one-third of councillors from various parties have been excluded from a real role in the council's affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local comment has been considerable. I would not quote members of my own party, but perhaps I may be allowed to quote Councillor Tom Gray of the Scottish National Party, who, following the decision, said:
	<br><q><p>"We have seen a travesty of justice and I am sorry to use such abrupt language but this is an example of 'Animal Farm' where pigs rule."</p></q>
My knowledge of George Orwell is not sufficient to know whether his analogy was correct, but he went on to accuse the Labour group of imposing a dictatorship and a Fascist and neo-Fascist policy. I believe that that shows the strength of feeling that exists among the minorities on that council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that many Labour members are very unhappy about what has happened. It is also clear that nothing has been done. There have been recent allegations that the ruling group is considering denying minority parties official papers. At the recent discussion on rates, the opposition were unable to put up a fully considered case because they did not have figures. That is in marked contrast to what happens in other Labour authorities, such as Strathclyde, where the Conservative Opposition—I have checked this—receive full co-operation from the majority group in obtaining figures so that they may put up a reasoned case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can be done to remedy what I believe by any standards is a totally acceptable situation that goes far beyond considerations of party politics? I pay tribute to the many Labour groups who would not dream of such behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>644</span>
I turn to the amendments to paragraph 8 of schedule 7 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I read that paragraph, which says:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Act, a council may make standing orders for the regulation of their proceedings and business and may vary or revoke any such orders."</p></q>
Amendment No. 49 suggests that standing orders of local authorities may come into effect only with the consent of the Secretary of State. That would leave a degree of flexibility to meet individual circumstances and achieve a common standard. I accept that it would create a burden of work for the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 137 would ensure that the standing orders of local authorities state that all members should receive papers. That refers to the problems being created about the receipt of papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 takes an alternative approach. It suggests that the standing orders of local authorities should provide for proportional representation. I have in mind that each committee would consist of members of the various parties in proportion to their total strength, plus possibly the addition of the convener and the vice-convener, to ensure that the governing party would have a majority. Amendment No. 138 is, in a sense, an alternative to amendment No. 49.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 provides a requirement that local authorities must have standing orders as against what I understand to be the position underpresent law— that they are optional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the position in this one authority is frankly unacceptable to the House, that it is a scandal and that we cannot accept it. The issues raised go far beyond party politics. It is basic to democracy that oppositions and minority groups should have rights. That is in the interests of all political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are well acquainted, Mr. Gourlay, with the problems that the hon. Gentleman has outlined, and I am too. I was involved, not directly, but very closely, with the position. I am not speaking in mitigation but the "aggro"—to use that crude expression—that the Labour group was subjected to before the May elections led directly to the present position. I am not arguing in favour of what was done after May, but there had been a good deal of incitement before that event. After the Labour group had won the elections it was in such a mind that it was prepared to act, and so it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the composition of the committees is as the hon. Gentleman has stated. He has been well-briefed by Mr. Mason—his speech bore all the hallmarks of Mr. Mason. Mr. Mason is very energetic and it is a great pity that he was sacked by the Tory Party as their organiser in Fife, because he was doing a good job. I do not know why he was sacked. I am surprised that he gave the hon. Gentleman that briefing, because he was so badly treated by his employers, the Tory Party. Nevertheless, it shows how dedicated he is to the cause, and we are all prepared to praise people who are dedicated to such a hopeless cause in Fife, in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in amendment No. 138, which provides for minority groups having "proportional representation on committees." This is a committee—a Scottish committee. There is no proportional representa
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>645</span>
tion on this Committee. If the Tories had proportional representation on this Committee they would be decimated. They would have about three members. As it is, for about 80 per cent, of the sitting time of the Committee Opposition Members have maintained the quorum. If the Government had been in the position of having to maintain the quorum, we would have got no further than clause 2 of the Bill. Time and time again there have been two hon. Members on the Government side apart from the Minister. Therefore, let us not talk nonsense about proportional representation on committees. If we had that in Scotland, there would be no Scottish legislation in this Parliament at all if it had to go into Committee. The Government would have to rely on English Members. Therefore, we rule that idea out as nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have party politics in local government and it is subject to abuse on all sides. I think that there has been an element, not of abuse, but of unwisdom. I have told the Labour group that it was tactically unwise to do what it did. Mr Mason should have been pushed on to the housing committee without anybody to second any motion that he moved. In that event, he would have been a helpless character, but able to give his advice. He has good advice to give on housing in his Tory way. I know that he wants to flog off every council house in Fife, but nobody would have taken any notice of that if he had been the only Tory on the housing committee. In that sense he would have been a political eunuch. That is how I like to see these people. It would have been proper democracy to have put Mr. Mason on to the committee and have prevented him from having any power, but he would have been able to talk and to give advice to those prepared to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the same with the SNP. There is a story, which I believe is true, that when the SNP first got members on this authority—it had never had members before—one of the first questions the SNP asked was "Where do you keep the money bags?" That was the SNP's great experience of local government. Let us understand that if members are elected, whatever their merits, they have a right to their views as minority parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether one can legislate for good behaviour in local government. All parties abuse their position when they get power in local authorities. I have given examples in another context of twinning by the Tories in Edinburgh. That abuse was as indefensible as anything that the hon. Gentleman has put forward about Kirkcaldy district council. I hope that he did not condone, either, the facts and figures I gave about those two Lord Provosts in Edinburgh over a period of five years. But that is going on in Labour-controlled authorities, too. When we come to the new clause, I shall be prepared to put on record some of the activities of abuse in that sphere by Labour people as well as by Tories and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be energetic in getting examples of abuses in Tory-controlled authorities as well as in Labour-controlled authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave the matter at that. I shall not vote because I do not believe that one can legislate to provide for all contingencies or statutorily rule against bad or indefensible behaviour by one local authority as against another. There is evil, bad, and indefensible behaviour in all parties. It is up to the local people to judge. When it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>646</span>
comes to subsequent elections, the electorate will make judgments on the local authority's behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the bad publicity locally. We do not expect much else because most local papers are Tory papers. The Labour Party does not expect any sympathy from the 	<i>Fife Free Press</i> or from the 	<i>Glenrothes Gazette.</i> It expects to be hammered in those papers. Labour Members make no complaint about that. We sometimes call it a free press, but it is a prostituted press, both locally and nationally. Abuses occur in all parties and they are equally indefensible wherever they occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central touched on the question of the complexion of the Committee. I am addressing myself to the amendments because I have a constituency interest in Dundee district council. If the Dundee formula were used for Committees in this House or anywhere else, we should not have the kind of representation we enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that if we had the kind of proportional representation that he says the Committee should have because of the Scottish Tory results, it would have been impossible to have passed virtually any English legislation since 1945 because of the position of the Labour Party in England. That is a futile and facile argument, because it does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee the Opposition parties have 39 per cent, of the members on the council. Yet the maximum representation that they enjoy on any of the committees is about 18 per cent. On the controversial housing committee, the Opposition have five out of 26 members. That is local democracy as practised by the Labour Party in Dundee. That is the party that screams about local democracy; yet when it is in power it behaves as if it had never heard of democracy.

I believe that it is inexcusable that minority groups on councils, regardless of political complexion, should not be given adequate proportional representation on council committees. To that extent I recommend councils to study how Perth and Kinross district council has behaved over many years. There the Labour Party is always in the minority, and yet it is given ample opportunities—indeed in the past it has been given convenerships—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>647</span>
should see a more realistic representation. I think that it is scandalous how the electors of Dundee have been treated by the Labour administration in Dundee, and I hope that the amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish in any way to defend Kirkcaldy, but we feel that it is regrettable that we have to take recourse to legislation to deal with something far better left to the local authorities. While we accept that in some local authorities there have been excesses since the elections, my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has made the point that the reactions of the Kirkcaldy district council Labour group were partly a reaction to the way in which it was treated when in opposition. It would be unfortunate if we were to seek to force through legislation which would further dictate to local authorities the actions that they have to take to conduct their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members have consistently wanted the Secretary of State to have as little as possible to do with local government. On this amendment our line is exactly the same. We hope that the Committee will not divide on the amendments but that they will be withdrawn, since the political points have been made by Conservative Members and in some instances they have been taken. However, to argue for proportional representation and to have it justified by legislation in the way envisaged here is not necessary or in the best interests of local government. For that reason we shall not support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather sad that the two Labour Members who have spoken have sought, albeit indirectly, to qualify their condemnation of the way in which the ruling Labour group of Kirkcaldy district council has behaved. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said "I would not call it abuse. I would say" —I think that these were his words—"that it was an example of unwisdom". I wonder what he would have said if the Conservative group on Edinburgh district council had excluded all Labour members from the housing committee. Would he have said of that, "It is not an example of abuse; it is a lack of wisdom on its part"? Would he have said that it was probably influenced by the way in which the Conservative members were treated when the Labour Party was in control? Of course he would not. He would have given us one of his ritual, emotional examples of hyperbole, talking about the council as a typical example of a fascist council acting in a terrible, totalitarian way. He knows that perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather pathetic that, because it happens to be a Labour group that has been behaving in this indefensible way, somehow the hon. Gentleman's condemnation has to be qualified and he seeks to look for an explanation of its conduct that puts it in a better light. I am glad that at least one hon. Member who is involved —you, Mr. Gourlay—have made your position known. It is essential that this Committee should make clear its unqualified condemnation of this form of behaviour, whichever political party might have been responsible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe there is a single hon. Gentleman on either side of this Committee who would in honesty give the slightest degree of sympathy to any political party which, having a majority on the council, totally excluded
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>648</span>
the representatives of minority parties from representation on any significant committee. In particular, when dealing with a district council, for which housing is its biggest single responsibility, to exclude totally the representatives of minority parties, which constitute one third of the total council, from any representation on the housing committee is indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sad that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has been silent on this issue and that his hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), the other Opposition spokesman, has sought to qualify his condemnation. If they had any guts at all they would have given total and unqualified condemnation to the way in which Kirkaldy Council has behaved in this matter. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Garscadden, who is usually the first to be outspoken when he believes that injustice is being experienced by any member of the community, has chosen to remain silent and sedentary. That is an unusual phenomenon for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not expect the hon. Gentleman to make a long speech. Normally his short speeches are at least 20 minutes of vitriolic abuse. But on this occasion, miraculously, the hon. Gentleman is struck dumb. It surprises us, and if he wishes to speak after I have sat down, for once I will not even imply any complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not go any further in describing the way in which the Labour Party in Kirkaldy has behaved. It is a total disgrace to any principles of democratic representation, as even the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) would acknowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), amendment No. 49 is a substantive amendment, which requires my right hon. Friend to approve all the standing orders of all the local authorities in Scotland, and such an obligation would extend to any changes of standing orders. Clearly, if there were evidence that the abuse of which Kirkaldy district Council's ruling Labour group has undoubtedly been guilty were widespread, it would be an inescapable obligation, whichever Government were in charge of these matters, to recommend such a change. However, at this stage we would find it difficult to take over such a systematic and detailed responsibility that would of necessity involve a detailed scrutiny of the standing orders of every local authority in Scotland and a continual updating of the standing order changes that are regularly made by local authorities. At the moment, no local authority of which I am aware, apart from this particular council, has behaved in the disgraceful way to which my hon. Friend has referred. It would be difficult, therefore, to justify a change, which would have major implications, on the basis of the experience of one council.

lems. If all reports and memoranda were circulated to all councillors, the vast majority of councils would be deluged with huge amounts of material—in many authorities they already are—and to require a compulsory obligation to do this would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 requires the provision of proportional representation on committees. Without going into the arguments for and against proportional representation on this occasion, I point out that there would be insurmountable difficulties. First we have a situation in which a substantial number of Scottish local authorities do not have political parties as their main form of representation. The independent authorities, including Highland regional council, Dumfries and Galloway regional council and a substantial number of district councils, have only a small minority of members of a political party who stood as candidates of that party, and there would be great difficulty in working the system suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there would be much difficulty in defining precisely a minority group. In many councils, people may be technically independent but sometimes come together as a group of independents to vote on issues, and on other occasions stand and vote simply as independents, without allegiance to any group, party or organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole matter, I have regretfully concluded that legislation would not be appropriate. I have not done so with any satisfaction, because I share my hon. Friend's view of the disgraceful way in which Kirkcaldy district council has behaved. I hope that the condemnation not only of this Committee but also, I understand, of the Kirkcaldy Labour Party, local Members of Parliament and others within the Labour Party will lead Kirkcaldy to change its attitude and on reflection realise that it brings no credit to itself or the town, and perhaps makes most of the Labour Party ashamed of the way in which it has behaved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the great sense of shame that it must have brought to hon. Gentlemen who have—[Hon. Members: 	<i>"Oh."]</i> Hon. Gentlemen should ask themselves how they would react if they were the minority party concerned. I am glad that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) recognises that, even if his hon. Friends do not. If they were the recipients of this form of practice they would be the first to condemn it with every imaginable adjective. On that basis, I feel that I speak for all members of the Committee in saying that I hope that Kirkcaldy district council will reconsider its attitude and bring some elementary fairness to the conduct of its affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) paid tribute to Councillor Mason's hard work, for which no doubt he will be pleased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member referred to Scottish representation on the Committee. It must be said that that is not central to the debate, and that this is a Committee of the House of Commons. The hon. Gentleman said that abuses could occur in all parties, and I accept that. His final point was that the electorate would know and judge. But the problem is that if the minorities cannot get
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>650</span>
representation on the committees, the electorate cannot know and judge, because the minorities will not have the opportunity of putting their views.

I welcome the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), who put on record the similar, but not quite as acute, problems in Dundee district.

The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) shrugged his shoulders and said that local authorities would sort out these matters. But local authorities are not yet sorting out the issues, certainly not Kirkcaldy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I naturally welcome the unqualified condemnation by my hon. Friend the Minister of what is happening in Kirkcaldy. I have to accept his arguments that none of the various efforts I made to meet the problem were practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I close by saying that I hope that reports of our proceedings will be widely read in Scotland. In the light of public opinion and of what has been said "in the debate and by the Minister, I hope that Kirkcaldy district council will realise that what it is doing reflects no credit on it, the Labour Party or Scotland.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 28, line 40, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"19B. In section 9 (6) (requirements as to conditions relating to improvement grants) for the words 'subsections (2) and (3)' there shall be substituted the words 'subsection (2)'.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 91 and 95, and Government new clause 6—	<i>Conditions of improvement grant not to include requirement as to letting.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 87, 91 and 95 are consequential on new clause 6, and it would, therefore, assist the Committee if I confined my remarks to the purpose of new clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause and its related amendments is in regard to section 9 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1974—to free houses on which improvement grant is paid from the condition which it has been possible for local authorities to impose hitherto, namely, that the house at all times at which it is not occupied by the applicant or by a member of his family will be let or kept available for letting. In addition to removing the power of local authorities to impose such a condition, the new clause removes the requirement on the grant recipient to be bound by any such condition which may be enforced on an existing grant and have to repay a grant if he breaks the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clear evidence that the way in which certain authorities have been interpreting this provision is not only contrary to the original spirit of the provision but is bringing considerable hardship on individuals who, for perfectly reasonable reasons, sell their homes and move elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person, having received an improvement grant, sells his house within a five-year period, perhaps to move elsewhere for family or employment reasons, unless that house is subsequently occupied by a person
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>651</span>
who is letting the house the local autority can require the applicant to repay a substantial proportion of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original purpose of the provision was simply to deal with possible profiteering on the part of those who might simply obtain an improvement grant and then sell off the house for the maximum profit. In fact, the way in which the provision has been operating has been to the disadvantage of ordinary members of the public who have sold their houses for legitimate reasons. There is clear evidence that the condition for repayment is enforced by a considerable number of authorities and is bearing harshly on individuals who, for good reasons not in any way connected with the receipt of the grant, find it is necessary to dispose of their houses and are burdened, directly or indirectly, with the need to repay all or part of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible under the present arrangement that a person who is required to repay will make a loss because the market value of the house has not increased in line with the amount of the grant. That was never the intention of the clause, but unfortunately certain local authorities have exercised their discretion in a way which has led to these harsh consequences. For that reason the new clause has been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By approving this new clause and the consequential amendments we will be rectifying a source of abuse of certain owner-occupiers and certain sellers of property in Scotland. I therefore commend the new clause and the amendments to the Commiteet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the past weeks and months we have been listening to the Minister, day after day, telling us about profligate local authorities indulging in excessive expenditure of one kind or another. Indeed, only last night I was watching television and there he was again saying exactly the same thing. Yet the Minister is recommending a new clause and a series of amendments which would lead to what many of us would regard as compulsory profligate expenditure by local authorities in the form of unconditional handouts to people indulging in the development of private properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, and it is made clear in the notes on clauses, that the original purpose of this condition was to control profiteering with improvement grants on private housing. I contend that it has worked in that way. Because this provision has been enforced it has not been possible for anybody to buy rundown property, improve it with the aid of a grant and then sell it off at a substantial profit, which would now include up to £5,250 per dwelling of public money in the form of improvement grant. At present the improvement grant runs to a maximum of £5,250 or 75 per cent, of the cost of the improvement work. In the case of housing action areas, the figure can be as high as 90 per cent. The sums can be substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are reasonable safeguards for owner-occupiers who may need, as the Minister has shown, to sell their houses for perfectly reasonable purposes—either because their circumstances have changed or because they need to move to another area, for whatever reason. The clawback provision as the Minister says at present applies only for five years, which is not such a terribly long time. In any case, the power is discretionary. Local authorities do not have to exercise their right to reclaim
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>652</span>
all of the grant if a house is disposed of. I cite one of my own local authorities, East Lothian district council, which has on occasions recently decided to waive its right to reclaim this grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister is overstating the problem. He was talking about hardship. He should indicate to the Committee to what extent the hardship exists. Perhaps he can think of a better way of overcoming it than by doing away with this power altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point which I want to emphasise briefly is the problem in rural areas. Oddly enough, the Conservative chairman of Berwickshire district council, Mr. James Evans, who was listening to our debate earlier this evening, told me only a few moments ago that his council has made strong representations to the Scottish Office against the amendment which the Minister has just moved. The problem to which I refer here is that of holiday homes in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the Minister could here be opening the floodgates for the transformation of many small, remote, rural communities into holiday villages, ghost communities, which has already happened in some areas. If the Committee and the House were to approve this measure at this stage it would make it far easier for this to happen, because people could go into these small communities via empty property, derelict property or whatever, claim improvement grants and then sell the properties at a substantial profit at public expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands. In so far as that could happen at all, it could happen under the existing law. This provision enables the local authority to recover the improvement grant only if the property is to not to be used for letting purposes or if it is not to be occupied by the applicant or his family. Therefore, if it is simply to be let for a holiday home, the local authority would not be able to recover the grant under the existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the Minister should say that. It gives rise to considerable concern if that is so. But in my own experience, from serving on Berwickshire district council, this is a serious problem for small communities on the Berwickshire coast such as St. Abbs, Coldingham and other small villages. Local people simply cannot afford to get their hands on property, and many properties have been taken over as holiday homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of two specific instances where this has happened. Somebody has bought a property, claimed improvement grant and then has not maintained it as his primary residence or has let it to someone to be his primary residence. In both these instances the local authority has clawed back the grant under the terms of existing legislation. It seems to have worked in those instances, and I see no reason why it should not continue to work like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not proven that the existing legislation is operating in a repressive manner. I am profoundly concerned that he could be opening floodgates here, which could cause real problems in certain rural areas, and could make it possible for speculators or private developers to profiteer at the public expense. I have yet to be persuaded that the amendments should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>653</span>
local authority in his constituency. He said that in his experience it has used its discretion reasonably. I do not dispute that; I have no reason to disbelieve him. However, our experience has been that the bulk of authorities have used their discretion to require repayment in virtually all cases. Some have refused to waive the right to receive repayment. We expect that in 1980-81, because of the way in which local authorities have refused to exercise their discretion, at least £800,000 would have been recovered from owner-occupiers who had simply sold their houses within five years of receiving an improvement grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no reason to doubt that in the vast majority of those cases the person selling the house was neither a speculator nor a profiteer, but an ordinary person who had obtained an improvement grant and who, because of job, family reason or some other perfectly legitimate reason, sold his house and moved elsewhere. It is absurd that local authorities should be able to recover the grant in such circumstances. There is evidence that such recovery causes considerable hardship. It can lead to a person selling his house losing out. If he has to pay back the full improvement grant, or a substantial proportion of it, he may be paying a sum greater than the increase in the value of the property resulting from the improvements that have been carried out. It is unfair to place that burden on owner-occupiers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: agree in principle; I do not wish to see hardship inflicted on anyone in such cases. However, the Minister is letting the baby out with the bathwater. In trying to cure an abuse that he says exists in certain areas—I take his word for that—he is doing away completely with local authorities' powers to claw back pretty substantial sums when the circumstances of the house have clearly changed—it may now be a holiday hosue or something similar—and profiteering may well be about to take place. The Minister is opening the door far too wide, and could do great harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first sight the amendments are merely technical. However, I have listened with interest to both sides of the argument; an important area has been opened up. I do not wish to delay the Committee at this stage, but I must tell the Minister that I accept that the reason for an improvement grant is to improve a house. In a sense the fact that the house is sold does not alter the basis on which the grant was given. I accept that general position. Society has decided that we wish to improve houses, to have improved property in the housing pool. Therefore, I do not object to the general line of the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the hon. Gentleman's own line of argument, surely the assumption behind improvement grants is that but for those grants the houses would not be improved. That is exactly the reasoning behind successive Governments' policies of ensuring that improvement grants are available for the improvement of the housing stock in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the general principle both sides of the Committee are at one. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>654</span>
Robertson) agrees with that. However, as he has pointed out, there may be marginal abuses, especially in country areas. Even in urban areas there may be unpleasant profiteering. I wonder whether there is not a halfway house that the Under-Secretary could have considered, such as retaining the discretion but also having a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, to cover the situation when, as has been maintained, the local authority is unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend not accept that there is an important distinction between homes that have been improved at public expense and are available for people to live in, to meet housing need, and those that, although they may also have been im-improved with the assistance of public funds, stand empty for up to nine months of the year? I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that that can cause considerable aggravation and annoyance in areas where some families have difficulty in finding homes. That is the distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that distinction. I accept that if public funds are being used to turn, say, a derelict country cottage not into a permanent home but into a weekend or occasional home, or as a means of raising income, that would be aggravating, but we may have to live with that. The general principle is correct. We are trying to improve the housing stock and are giving grants for that purpose, and we must live with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying to the Under-Secretary that it might have been better to leave the situation whereby the clawback could be made by a local authority, but if that power was being unreasonably used—it is in the Under-Secretary's mind that there have been abuses—there should be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against such use. It would have allowed a measure of flexibility and a safeguard against abuse in some of the areas that my hon. Friend mentioned. It would also have allowed a right of appeal for intervention by the Secretary of State in cases of dictatorial or unfair practices by local authorities. I am worried about the total sweeping away of the total clawback provision in all circumstances, and I wonder whether something more flexible along the lines that I menioned could not have been developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, will the Under-Secretary say something about the consultations that I assume he has had on the change in the law? I have received no representations on this, but I was interested to hear my hon. Friend say that the chairman of Berwick district council had claimed that his local authority made energetic representations. The council is not of my political persuasion, but presumably it has good grounds for its anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether there have been consultations and whether the Berwick point of view—first-hand evidence now relayed to us hot from the press, so to speak—is widely reflected in similar areas. If it is, will the Minister dwell upon it? If he were to seek to withdraw the amendments now, he would have plenty of time to come back on Report, and we might not oppose them then if our fears proved illusory. There seems to be substance in the arguments advanced and the anxiety expressed, which might suggest a pause before rushing headlong into these changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>655</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkinds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) made related to the possibility of second homes and his concern over that. I must say two things to him. First, one cannot get an improvement grant for a second home. Therefore he is concerned with whether an applicant is the kind of person who is likely to wish to sell it off as a second home. My second point is that the local authority will still have total discretion as to whether to give an improvement grant in the first place. It is for the authority to determine whether there is some reason why it would be undesirable or unsuitable for an applicant to receive an improvement grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking of removing the right to give grants, because that remains at the authority's discretion. It is rather that, if having received a grant, the person then sells his house, it seems unreasonable that the grant should have to be repaid simply because the person has chosen to sell. That is all that the amendment would achieve, and on that basis I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that the purpose of the improvement grants is to increase housing stock? Does he not also accept that if someone were able to obtain a local authority improvement grant by persuading an official that he intended to move to a house in a village or elsewhere and subsequently used the house himself, or let it to others as a holiday home, that would be an abuse of the system? Will he undertake to consider that problem further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall certainly consider the points that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>656</span>
the hon. Gentleman raised. What I think he is trying to do is to use a provision for a purpose for which it was not intended and saying that because ultimately someone might sell a house in his area which might be used as a holiday home, the local authority should get the improvement grant back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of improvement grants has to be related primarily to the condition of the property and the use that will be made of it at the time the local authority considers the application. The authority is already forbidden to give improvement grants for second homes, and even if it is for a first home an authority may, if it considers that there is a likelihood of its being abused, refuse to give the grant. That discretion is not being removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
