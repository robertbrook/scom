	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered Class XV, Votes 15 and 16.—	<i>[Mr. Alexander Fletcher.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we have chosen an education topic for debate, which may seem surprising after the consideration given to the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill and to the variety of subjects which were dealt with on Third Reading. We felt that it was important, indeed vital, to look at education as it affects the 16 to 18 or 19 years age group. I say "18 or 19 " because there are some youngsters at school who are over 18, so although the Minister has published the document 16 to 18 it stretches into the 19 years age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This area probably presents the most important challenge facing our education and training service —how we cope with the rising tide of youth unemployment, how we can best prepare our young people for a society whose economy at present is apparently incapable of utilising their talents and abilities, and how we make best use of the existing educational resources to ensure that young people do not lose out on any of the opportunities that are available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 29 October 1979 the Minister issued a document " 16-18s in Scotland " and he sought responses by 31 December 1979. In an Adjournment debate in January 1980, which was instituted by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigton) the Minister said that he hoped to comment once all the replies had been received and that he had extended the date for the replies until March 1980. Some 15 months later we have yet to get a reply or a reasoned response from the Minister on that area. We have had one or two gimmicky initiatives but we have not really had any serious coherent policy statements from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition appreciate that a Government committed to laissez-faire economics will find concepts of manpower planning otiose and distasteful. For them the free market should be able to set the wage levels in such a way as to ensure that everyone should get a job, that the able will be motivated to study and that the less able will leave school to opportunities commensurate with their talents. We know that in the past two years this
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
has come to be a blatant nonsense and the unemployment figures which were announced this week bear testimony to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present some 30,000 school leavers are looking for work, competing with another 270,000 Scots in a contracting job market. Figures of this enormity will not melt away overnight. The problem of training and retraining our work people will be the major preoccupation of the 1980s and well into the decade thereafter. It will require far more than the simplistic crisis management of the last two years. It will need far more than the vague statements of intent that we heard from the lips of the Secretary of State for Employment yesterday, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" If an extra 100,000 places are necessary in order to fulfil our undertaking "—</p></blockquote>
to provide training opportunities for young people—
	<br><blockquote><p>" we shall have to find the necessary resources."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 24 June 1981; Vol. 7, c. 256.]</p></blockquote>
This is not the way in which a Government should be looking at the problems of the young unemployed. They are simply saying that they will extend the resources to meet the crisis without any clear indication of how and where the places should be provided or, how they should be funded; they are simply saying that if there is a problem they will somehow find the means to resolve it, but they, are not describing in any detail the means which should be opened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that today the Minister will be able to reveal some of his thoughts on the matter because, as we say, he has had about 15 to 18 months to consider the responses to his discussion document— a document which, I think it is no secret to say, appeared on the desk of my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) during his period as Secretary of State for Scotland which he regarded as inadequate and, therefore, did not publish. Subsequently, it was dusted down and brought out under the imprimatur of the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was perhaps a measure of the lack of concern in 1979, or the complacency of the Scottish Office at that time, that it felt that an inadequate discussion document of that nature was sufficient to instigate a debate on a matter of this importance. Those engaged in education and training are despairing of ever getting the leadership and the breadth of vision which Government must bring to problems of this magnitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) is in a unique position to meet such a challenge since he has responsibility for both education and industry. The Secretary of State for Scotland has responsibility for the activities of the Manpower Services Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be delighted this morning if the Minister can tell us his intentions. The Opposition feel that a new, flexible and coherent system of education and training opportunities should be provided and should extend throughout adult life. About 50 per cent, of people in the 16 to 18 age group lose contact with the education service as soon as they leave school. Falling school rolls will result in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
very short time in even those who are at school having a limited opportunity to pursue the courses of their choice. Indeed, Strathclyde region has forecast that of the 25 comprehensives in the region which now have rolls over 200 in years five and six, by the year 1990 only five of these comprehensives will have rolls of that size and that the average roll for the senior part of a secondary school will be between 50 and 60 pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very serious problem because it means that those young people who stay on for the final years of secondary education will have a very restricted choice of subjects, given the cuts which the Government are carrying through. The expensive courses which need capital expenditure— courses such as those in technical subjects and physics, for which there are shortages of teachers, are the subjects in which we shall see the most drastic cuts in opportunities for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that for those who are in full-time education in this age group, it is not simply a matter of focusing attention on the problems of the comprehensive schools. We have to consider the possibilities which are open to us in respect of further education colleges, and we have to look at a far more flexible use of these institutions. Ironically at the moment in many areas the further education colleges are bursting at the seams as the schools become less and less well used because of falling school rolls. I do not think any member of the Opposition would deny that schools will have to close, but when schools closed we would hope that the buildings and the equipment within them could be used in a more flexible way, with arrangements made for young people to go to colleges of further educations while pursuing courses in those schools which remained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also take account of the fact that in urban areas these problems can be resolved relatively easily. There are transport facilities, there are opportunities for the re-utilisation of buildings, the re-designation of institutions. But in the country areas and in the smaller towns, far greater imagination will have to be applied to the problems and far more resources made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards any consideration of post-compulsory education and training, I would suggest to the Minister that, if the Minister has not had the opportunity to read Strathclyde region's discussion paper on education and training after compulsory education he would be well advised to do so. Had he sought to call it his and give us that as his statement of intention, many of us would have welcomed it as the policy of the Government in Scotland. But given the changes which are to take place in a very short time in our society, indeed which are taking place at the moment, we have to recognise that the eduction service is by and large failing half of the children over 16. At present no more than half of them are touched by the education system once they leave school, and of those over 18, about 70 per cent, are not involved in any form of formal education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
I do not lay the failure of the formal education services at the door of this Government. It is a responsibility which should be borne by the whole of the education service. But we have to change the position where for a large part of our population education finishes at the age of 16. Indeed, one can almost say that for a large part of the population, education probably finishes considerably earlier than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This can be made easier by the fact that there will be a drop in population and we should be able to spread resources more thickly over those who will be of the age about which we are talking. But we know that the likely unemployment trends will persist with sustained unemployment among young people. We know that the trend is for more and more young people to be out of work for longer than 26 weeks. The Manpower Services Commission is striving to provide courses, at times against a background of lack of sympathy from employers and suspicion from young people because many of them feel that the courses which are being provided are nothing more than the use of cheap labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Misgivings have now been expressed by trade unions as to the quality of the youth opportunity schemes and there is a crisis of confidence in many of these projects. The Government will have to provide sufficient funds to ensure that the job experience schemes as well as the youth opportunity schemes become attractive to employers, that young people can be taken on and their energies harnessed, and that they can be given the opportunity to appreciate the importance of being in regular—albeit artificial—employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will doubtless tell us that about 70 per cent, of those who go through the schemes eventually find full-time employment. I shall not quibble about the figure of 70 per cent. It is the one which he invariably uses. But there are other figures which suggest that in some parts of the country it could be as low as 50 per cent. The problems of long-term youth unemployment lie at the heart of the difficulties of the 16 to 18 years olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the problems which are created by falling school rolls can provide us with opportunities for better use of existing facilities. There would be greater flexibility. Young people who are staying on at school should be given courses which are of greater relevance to the future job prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we may have some misgivings about the Munn and Dunning proposals, we know that they will take time to work through the system anyway. But there are SCOTEC and SCOTBEC courses which could be made avilable in schools and which would be far more useful to those youngsters who will not be pursuing academic courses after the age of 18. If young people could take a wider range of SCOTEC and SCOTBEC courses, that would go some way to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also hope that the barriers between the school system and the further education colleges can be progressively broken down. To do that requires a degree of goodwill and trust in the teaching profession. Frankly, the way in which the Minister has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
dealt with the teaching unions does not suggest that they have a great deal of confidence in his ability to ask them to be, on the one hand, more flexible, and on the other, so flexible that they will give up thousands of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also look for flexibility in the use of the community education service which, in Strathclyde for example, has played a leading role in working with the long-term unemployed. We must have far greater integration of these schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that there should be some sort of central control. One of the features of this Parliament has been the extent to which the power and independence of local authorities have been eroded by central Government. But the Minister should seek to encourage local authorities to integrate the plethora of organisations operating in this field. It is to the Minister that we look for leadership. We need more flexible courses and local authorities should be given more responsibility backed by adequate funding. We do not accept the argument that because school rolls fall as a result of a dramatic fall in population, the level of provision should fall at the rate which the Minister envisages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, our biggest long-term problem in education is to provide opportunities for the young unemployed, to compensate in some cases for the failure of the education system and in other cases to provide them with the opportunity to prepare themselves for employment when it comes. Yesterday the Secretary of State for Employment said that if there were more unemployed he would provide more money for courses, without giving serious thought to the content and purpose of the courses. We are also concerned that the Minister seems to think that throwing into schools a few microprocessors in the form of mini computers is the answer to the problem. We accept that these are desirable, but they do not provide the exclusive answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks who does. We propose to ask him what other things are going on and what other sources of encouragement we can look to in our education service. At the moment there is precious little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a wide-ranging topic. We know that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs is looking at youth unemployment. We know that the Council for Tertiary Education is looking at the institutional framework of post-school education. We know that there are 30,000 young people looking to the Minister for a coherent response to the problems that we have raised. We say there is an opportunity. We have in Scotland a highly integrated education system with only a small number of authorities. In regions like Strathclyde there is a level of expertise probably far higher than that available to the Scottish Education Department. We have a variety of organisations willing to work, but the Government, in their failure to respond to
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
the replies which they called for and their failure to give leadership are allowing a bad situation to become worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if unemployment were to fall, there is no guarantee that the prospects for youngsters in the 16 to 19 year age group would be any better, because we know that in a time of rapidly changing technology it is quite likely that the people who at the moment are unfit for employment, because of the inadequacies of their past education, in five or 10 years could well be facing exactly the same difficulties once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Minister this morning to try to answer these questions and to try to meet this tremendous demand which will not go away when unemployment figures fall. Yesterday the Prime Minister said that she did not know when the situation would improve—only that it would get worse. So we ask the Minister to make clear to us what his intentions are. He has been too silent for too long on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Opposition for choosing this subject for debate this morning. We have spent a considerable amount of time in this Session discussing Scottish education, and we make no complaint about that. The Government have given careful consideration not only to the education system but to the quality of education in Scotland since coming into office in May 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We started off, as we said we would—our intentions were clear—by looking at the motivation of parents and children in our schools on the basis that the more parents and children could feel involved in decisions about their own education, particularly in the choice of school, the greater would be the motivation of the children in the classroom, and that in turn would benefit the quality of education and help with the motivation of the school as a whole— not least that of the teachers. So we prepared our legislation, which is now being debated in another place, by highlighting the importance of parental choice, the involvement of children and parents in making decisions about education, and providing information for parents about schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken into account in the Bill the difficult question of school closures, putting as much of the decision-making in that regard with the local authorities—because we believe that they are best placed to make these decisions—while at the same time laying down the requirements for consultation in areas where schools are affected by closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also relevant to note that one of the first steps we took, which did not require legislation, was to increase the pace of planning to implement the Munn and Dunning proposals. I am sure that the hon. Member for Clackmannon and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), with his experience of education, will agree that if we are to make an impact on 16 to 18 year olds in our schools, we have to make a big effort to get the curriculum right for the 14 to 16 year olds. This is what the Munn and Dunning proposals provide. They accept that there must be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
a syllabus and assessment in our schools, particularly in the 14 to 16 age group, which makes school more relevant to those children at school in that age group, because under the present system, as Opposition Members know, the O-grade examinations cater for only about 30 per cent, of the children. The fact that we intend to differentiate between three levels of ability for 14 to 16 year olds should greatly improve the motivation and, therefore, the objectives of children when they come to the examinations which are being arranged for them under the Munn and Dunning proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just mentioned Munn and Dunning and the Government's determination to introduce the Munn and Dunning reports. As both these reports combined will cost £6 million in the first year they are introduced, rising to £13 million per annum, could the Minister tell us when the Scottish Office will make the resources available to the education authorities to finance the introduction of Munn and Dunning? It is not much good giving us platitudes if the finance does not accompany them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Munn and Dunning proposals are already incurring costs which are being borne by the Scottish Office. As these costs increase and as we proceed to implement the Munn and Dunning proposals—as the hon. Gentleman knows, the final decision will be made at the end of the pilot scheme in 1983—the appropriate funds will be made available. I agree with the implication of the hon. Gentleman's remarks that there would be no point in the Government proceeding to implement Munn and Dunning without at the same time making adequate resources available for the success of the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister concede that much of the work on Munn and Dunning has been done on the cheap? That is because teachers have been prepared to undertake the curricula development work on a voluntary basis, without anything in the way of material reward for it, apart from the satisfaction they get from it. At present, the work is being done on a shoestring budget, largely through the good offices of local authorities which are prepared to allow individuals time off to carry out this work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reject the mean attitude to the work of teachers in the comments of the hon. Gentleman. I reject the idea that if a teacher is asked to do anything at all that is remotely unconnected with his duties in the classroom or in the school there must immediately be negotiations to see what monetary compensation or time off should be available. Real teachers are not like that. Perhaps the teachers with whom the hon. Gentleman does his politics are like that, but I can assure him that real teachers in our schools are not like that. They take a much broader view of their duties and responsibilities towards their profession and towards the children in their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
It may be helpful in proceeding with the subject for debate this morning if I make it clear at the outset that I shall be referring to the education of 16 to 18 year olds, not to that of 16 to 19 year olds. The latter expression, which is commonly used in debates about education in England and Wales and which featured in the title of the Macfarlane report published at the end of last year, derives from the English Education Act 1944, which defines " senior pupils " as persons who have attained the age of 12 years but not the age of 19. Whichever expression we use, however, we are talking about the same age group—namely, young people of 16, 17 or 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that we are to have the advice of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) throughout these proceedings, as we had on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill when he interspersed remarks such as " Rubbish" and " Nonsense " at regular intervals. I hope he gets this off his chest early in the proceedings so that the Committee can discuss this most important and serious subject, which is treated with such contempt by the hon. Member for Cathcart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we can identify 16 to 18 year olds as a distinct group with particular needs, we do not have—as certain European countries have—separate institutions or a distinct sector of the education system dedicated exclusively to the education of 16 and 17 year old children. It is mainly for this reason that we are unable to identify separately central or local government expenditure on education provision for 16 to 18 year olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not have a separate 16 to 18 sector of education, the age of 16, the end of compulsory education, represents a very clear dividing line and marks the onset of quite different educational circumstances for the pupils themselves. At this stage of a young person's development, we can discern quite clearly the need not only for vocational preparation but also for some form of continuing education of a general kind aimed at the achievement of greater self reliance and a fuller understanding of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people at 16 are faced with an education system which has evolved in response to a variety of social, economic and political influences. Rationalisation is something which is frequently urged upon us in education as in other areas, but I believe that our approach to this matter should be essentially pragmatic and that, before making radical changes, we should be sure that they will effect real improvement. As the hon. Gentleman has already said, the structure of tertiary education is currently being examined by the Council for Tertiary Education under the chairmanship of Sir Norman Graham. My right hon. Friend hopes to receive the council's report before the end of the year. That is obviously an important study, very closely related to the subject that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

will be published, or will it be one of those confidential documents which goes only to the Secretary of State and Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that has been the practice of this Government. We have made reports available, as a glance at the table here indicates. Before the sitting started I was saying " What does the Scottish Education Department do? It publishes reports and provides employment in the printing industry." I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that we are not at all mean in the information that we make available, not merely for political and ministerial purposes but for the benefit of the education system of Scotland as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In talking about meanness and information in the same breath, would the Minister remind himself of his commitment to give a consultative document on the future of the colleges of education in Scotland? Not only did no consultation document appear, nor indeed did any consultation occur, but all we got was a surreptitious written question in the House of Commons with no opportunity for debate before the last Summer Recess. If he is going to proclaim about the documents on the table, why does he not explain to the people of Scotland the lack of a document about the colleges of education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Party is still smarting under the fact that we have been able to rationalise teacher training colleges in Scotland in a way that was completely lost to the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the use that young people make of the present system. The latest available statistics show that in the session 1979-80, of the total number of 16 to 18-years-olds in Scotland just over 20 per cent, were at school; almost 10 per cent, were in full-time further or higher education; another 20 per cent, were attending part-time day or evening further education courses. That leaves a balance of 50 per cent, who were either in employment and receiving no further education, or were unemployed. That is a statistic from which none of us can derive any satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a regrettable fact that, although in recent years there has been a marked improvement in the proportion of pupils staying on at school beyond the minimum statutory leaving age, and a continuing increase in the numbers of young people taking full-time advanced and non-advanced courses of further education, a large proportion of the age group with which we are concerned this morning are effectively non-participants in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to the importance of the Munn and Dunning proposals and the fact that these differentiate between three levels of ability for 14 to 16-year-olds in our secondary schools on questions of syllabus and assessment. That will clearly be a big step forward in overcoming these problems. I believe it to be the basic step in going on to deal with the 16 to 18-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Committee will also know that the youth opportunities programme, which was introduced as
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
a job creation scheme, is now being enhanced— not merely increased, but enhanced—to include more relevant aspects of training and work experience. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has made clear on a number of occasions, not least with his new training initiative, the importance of this scheme in not just filling in time for youngsters but giving them exposure to work experience and to other kinds of training that will be relevant and help them to find employment in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bothwell)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the most important aspects of the hon. Gentleman's speech so far is in relation to the monetary problems. It is, of course, perfectly correct that the YOP is paying £23 50. I notice that there was a demonstration yesterday against the payment that is being made. I am not going to be argumentative about that. The point I want to make is this. As we get down to technical colleges and other colleges where young people are being trained, we find that there is a reluctance on the part of the children to take further education for the simple fact that the ones who are unemployed are receiving after a period, £2350. That acts, believe it or not, as a deterrent to youngsters taking further education. I have raised this point many times and the Government should give some consideration to try to broaden out the YOP scheme to bring those youngsters into the payment of the £23.50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the point the hon. Gentleman makes and it is a problem because, for some children, it is a disincentive and they may have very little choice because of the family income circumstances; they may feel that they have to go for the larger financial reward. But other children, when faced with the option of some work experience and training, are obviously prepared to make some financial sacrifice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment is fully aware of this problem and has referred to it on a number of occasions, and the Government as a whole would clearly like to assist as soon as possible. But resources are constrained, and if we are to pay more immediately to young people in YOP schemes we would have to reduce the number of places available. It is a bit of a balancing act, but my right hon. Friend is determined, as the hon. Gentleman will know, to try to improve and make progress with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) referred to the consultative paper which we issued in October 1979. Its opening paragraph stated quite starkly that:
	<br><blockquote><p>" A disturbingly large proportion of young people cease at age 16 to have any organised contact with institutions or groups aiming to assist them in their continued educational development."</p></blockquote>
This debate, as the hon. Gentleman quite rightly anticipated, affords me the opportunity to report on the responses made to the consultative paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It evoked wide and varied reactions. I think it would be fair to say, however, that it was on the whole well received. The responses reflected a desire, for reform and further development, but they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
did not point to any obvious solutions of the problems which the paper had outlined. The absense of any clear consensus has naturally made it less easy to decide what is the best way forward. Nevertheless, some of the ideas canvassed in the paper have attracted sufficient support to justify further action along certain lines which I should like to explain to the Committee. Before doing so, it might be useful to remind ourselves of the six basic questions which the consultative paper posed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These were, first, what can be done to induce more young people to participate in post-compulsory education and training? Secondly, how can the education service help to improve the prospects of young people on the employment market? Thirdly, what changes are needed in the range of courses offered in the first two years of post-compulsory education? Fourthly, what can be done to achieve closer collaboration between schools and colleges of further education? Fifthly, is there scope for the development of new types of institution such as tertiary colleges, or for a measure of specialisation among secondary schools. Finally, what other changes are required in the organisation and structure of the education service to resolve the issues discussed in this paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important and far-reaching questions and, predictably, the responses elicited by these questions did not come neatly marshalled within the framework they were intended to provide. Apart from the lack of consensus to which I have already referred, some of those who responded attempted, contrary to the best examination practice, to answer all six questions at once. Others followed a hallowed tradition by answering questions which had not been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the respondents, I concede that the consultative paper was more than a questionnaire; it raised a variety of issues which were not fully comprehended by the six questions listed, and I propose to discuss the reactions to the paper under the following three headings: new course; partnership between schools and FE colleges, and possible changes in the structure of post-school education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper suggested that two new categories of full-time post-16 courses might be introduced. The first was a range of courses offered as an alternative to SCE higher grade examinations. Such courses would include technological or business subjects and would prepare students either for entry to technician level employment or for higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category was courses at a lower level for pupils whose performance at O-grade was not very good. These courses would continue general education but with a vocational emphasis, and would prepare the students for entry to appropriate vocational further education courses conferring recognised national qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although these suggestions did not command universal support, they clearly appealed to a large number of those who commented on the consultative document and who welcomed the possibility of developing courses which provided a better pre
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
paration for working life. Considerable study has already been given to the principles upon which such courses might be based and how they might best be fitted in with traditional academic courses, so that premature specialisation and unnecessary demands on resources are avoided. The aim will be to produce a flexible range of studies which can be offered to young people and which match their interests and aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work is also proceeding in the Scottish technical and business education councils on the development of courses of a broad vocational nature but for students whose level of attainment does not warrant intensive academic study or a premature choice of specialised vocational studies. These new studies would reflect the importance accorded to experience and work outside the educational institution, an emphasis on learning methods which take account of the young person's independence, and a programme designed in a flexible way to meet differences in the duration and pattern of study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there are genuine prospects for useful development here, but a good deal of curriculum development needs to be undertaken in consultation with the educational interests concerned. It will also be necessary to study further the implications for the future structure and organisation of secondary and further education, about which I shall say more in a minute. We must also ensure that any development of new courses on the lines I have indicated is properly co-ordinated with the Munn and Dunning development programme. Action along these lines would help to bring about a closer integration of compulsory and post-compulsory education and a more coherent provision for 16 to 18-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the subject of partnership between schools and further education colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, could he give the Committee some indication of the time scale as to when the Government plan will develop for these positions for these 18-year-olds, considering that by 1982 we shall have something like 941,000 18-year-olds in Britain, and a proportional share in Scotland? These plans will have to develop very quickly in order that the curricula are developed and that places are made available. Will the money be available, because that is very important</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say to the hon. Gentleman that our experience with the Munn and Dunning proposals shows that one cannot rush into these changes because the curriculum development takes several years. We have not wasted a second on Munn and Dunning since we came into office in 1979. But it would be quite Wrong for me to suggest this morning that the planning that is now beginning to take place for the courses that I have just been describing is something that we can expect to find finalised in 1982. The pace of the development must be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
matter for the professional judgment of our educational advisers in the Scottish Office, no matter how impatient Ministers and Members of Parliament generally are, as I recognise to see changes and improvements in the education system for this age group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), surely there is the point that SCOTEC and SCOTBEC have courses at the moment which could be adapted for school purposes relatively easily, and that it would be possible quite quickly to institute a closer link between further education colleges and schools in a relatively short timetable in order that existing courses could be made use of by pupils of medium ability of the post O-grade side of education, and that that group who are in school could make use of courses which are perhaps better suited to their needs than the existing SCE courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. As I indicated, the courses are being planned and the time scale may be a relatively short one. But that is a matter, I must repeat, of professional judgment and advice. Nevertheless, there are other considerations as far as partnership between schools and further education colleges is concerned. Those who commented on the conclusive document were generally in favour of closer collaboration between the two sectors. As the consultative document indicated, there is really too sharp a dividing line between secondary education and further education. At a time when secondary school rolls are falling and the number of 16 to 18-year-olds is about to fall, it seems right in principle to take a fresh look at the use being made of the total resources of the secondary school system and the further education system. A great deal of the provision at present made in further education colleges is directly related to industrial training, and is meant to complement it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many vocational courses do contain provision for general education, and unified vocational preparation schemes and the education and training provision with the youth opportunities programme are beginning to influence the approaches used in traditional vocational further education courses. But, by and large, there is a discontinuity between what goes on in secondary schools and what goes on in further education colleges. More widespread provision of courses for school pupils which combine work at school and at further education colleges, and the introduction of new post-16 courses of the kind that I have mentioned, could help to remedy that. But there are significant problems of organisation and resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor which cannot be ignored is the existence of separate teaching qualifications for secondary and further education. The effect of these is to limit the extent to which further education teachers can take courses for school pupils or teach in schools. That clearly is another of the difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not an argument for increasing the role of the colleges of education and possibly giving more places in them to people who want to train or retrain—further education teachers, for example, who would like to train for secondary education, or secondary school teachers who would like to train for further education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends in the first instance on the qualifications of the particular teachers. I am talking about their academic qualifications required for entry to a teacher-training college, which might not be available, particularly in an important technical subject in a further education college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is scope for closer collaboration between schools and colleges through the deployment of further education teachers who hold the teaching qualification (secondary education). But much more flexible arrangements would be possible if further education staff holding the teaching qualification (further education) were able to teach in schools or to teach pre-16 pupils at college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other factors which tend to reinforce the rather artificial barrier which exists between our schools and colleges. Hon. Members will be aware of the difficulties, but I hope in the next few months to enter into further consultations with the interests concerned in order to see whether some at least of these difficulties can be overcome. I am sure that the Committee would support consultations of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to see the very considerable resources which are available to the two sectors— resources of staffing, accommodation and equipment—utilised to the full for the benefit of an age group whose needs are diverse but who share one basic need—for education and training which prepare them adequately for employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of possible changes in structure and organisation. This is, of course, closely linked with the other two aspects that I have been discussing. The consultative paper outlined a number of possibilities, including the joint provision by schools and colleges of courses having a general educational objective but with a vocational emphasis —the establishment of tertiary colleges providing for all post-compulsory students; the establishment of colleges incorporating the post-compulsory classes of several schools; the rationalisation of post-compulsory school education by concentrating in particular schools the provision of fifth and sixth-year courses in particular areas of the curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have noticed recent press reports about ideas being canvassed within Strathclyde regional council concerning a possible reorganisation and a degree of merging between secondary schools and further education colleges. These suggestions are, of course, entirely a matter for the regional council, and I do not propose to comment on them except to say that they seem to represent yet a further variant on the theme of structural and institutional change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the ideas on possible structural changes discussed in the consultative paper, I have to say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
that none received a very warm welcome, although a significant minority of respondents did support the idea of establishing tertiary colleges. The reluctance to contemplate significant changes in institutions or in the organisation of and relationships between different parts of the education system is understandable. But it seems to me that, whether we like it or not, the tide of events is moving us towards structural changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The population projects show that this year the population of the 16-to-18 age group in Scotland will reach its peak at 277,000, after which there comes a steady decline to about 262,000 in 1985 and a further plunge to as low as 215,000 by 1990. Against this background, and taking into account the need for new post-compulsory courses and for closer collaboration between schools and further education colleges, it would be unwise to set our faces against the possibility of at least some experimentation with new educational institutions and structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I firmly believe that, by redeploying the resources which are available, we can bring about significant improvements in the service offered to our young people. The resources available include staff, buildings and equipment, as well as money. So far as money is concerned, I have already explained that the education expenditure on provision for 16 to 18-year-olds cannot be separately identified. But I must emphasise that, despite the constraints on public expenditure, financial provision for education in Scotland is on a very large scale. The allocations for education in local authority relevant expenditure in the current and two previous financial years were, at November 1979 prices, £824 million in 1979-80, £788 million in 1980-81 and £768 million in 1981-82. These relatively small reductions reflect the considerable reduction in school numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within these figures the provision for local authority current expenditure on further education, in colleges managed by the education authorities and not central institutions and colleges of education, in 1979-80 was £78 million, in 1980-81, it was £79 million and in 1981-82 it was £78-5 million. These figures are at constant prices, and show that during a period of restriction on public expenditure we have done our best to maintain the allocations for further education, accepting as we do the importance of this sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the consultative paper was to stimulate new thinking about the form and content of post-compulsory education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is amazed at the prospect of new thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much new thinking in the hon. Gentleman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's surprise at the prospect of any new thinking, but the purpose of the paper was to bring that about. We have been reasonably encouraged by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
response, and I hope that we can be reasonably encouraged this morning in a debate which I hope hon. Members opposite will take seriously. I hope that we may find that they are willing to produce some new and imaginative thinking in this debate on Scottish education. We believe that the paper has served a useful purpose, but we need to keep up the momentum and we would like to think that the contributions of hon. Gentlemen to this debate will help to do that in a constructive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During his comments at one point the Minister referred to my contempt—I think that was what he said—for this subject. I have to say that I did not hear him exactly, but the speech that he has just given, the manner of his delivery, the obvious disinterest that he showed in his dull reading of his brief indicate that he has great contempt for the education service which he is supposed to cover. That was perfectly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do in fact welcome certain points in his speech. I agree with him that we need new initiatives, we need new imaginative approaches, we need possibly to look carefully at the structural changes that are required. But if we analyse what the Minister has said, it will take us 10 years to implement the proposals because we will spend 10 years talking about them. That is the sort of time scale he appears to be talking about. On the record of his present imaginative approach to education, the structural changes he will bring about will be a disaster for Scottish education; they are not the sort of changes that are genuinely required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Opposition do not show an imaginative approach to the problems of further education, I suggest that he should look at some of the resolutions, both to the STUC and to the Labour Party conferences over a number of years in Scotland, where he will see that the sort of things that he is now beginning to talk about have been on the agenda—in the Labour Party, the STUC and the education world generally—for many years and are not suddenly appearing out of the blue, as he seems to suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the long history of resolutions of great educational value that have been debated at Labour Party and STUC conferences. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will also tell us why none of the points that I have been talking about this morning—which I presume he thinks have some merit, since they come from education sources in Scotland—were not implemented by the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. The Labour Government were beginning to move towards experimentation. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members may laugh, but it is a remarkable fact that, when the Munn and Dunning report came out, about which the Under-Secretary of State made great play, it was considered in practically every educational circle in Scotland as being essentially a reactionary document. That was particularly so of Munn. Nowadays in educational circles and in the rest of the Conservative Government's education policies, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
report is considered to be' highly enlightened, which I find quite remarkable. It was my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) who instituted the scheme for industrial experience in schools. He introduced the experiment for giving children in schools some idea of that the world of work was about. I accept that the Minister has continued that theme, but what he cannot do is to take credit for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried that my hon. Friend is about to give the Minister more credit than he actually deserves; even in my kindest moments I would never be in favour of that. Does my hon. Friend appreciate, in talking about liaison between the schools and industry, that our hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) set up the Scottish committee for schools-industry liaison. The first thing that this Minister did when he came to power was to abolish that committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because of course he is absolutely right. Those were the sort of schemes that my hon. Friend the Member for Queen's Park, backed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), was beginning to institute. In fact the process has slowed down as a result of this Government coming to power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member suggesting that in the past in Scotland we have never had a liaison between schools and industry, because I find that quite surprising? Indeed, our record in that area is very honourable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why I gave way for the hon. Gentleman to make that particular point. I never suggested that there was no liaison in the past between schools and industry. The Minister said that the liaison in the past had not been adequate. He did not say there was none. He said that it was inadequate, and I agree with him. My hon. Friend the Member for Queens Park began that liaison, started to look very seriously at this question and went a long way down that road. It really is not good enough for the Minister to suggest that the previous Labour Government did anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating an extremely serious area of education that is particularly serious at the present time and has been serious for many years. Let us examine Britain's record—which includes Scotland's record—of educating its students or its people aged 16-plus. For too long—in fact for the whole of this century, if not even longer—this country has had an appalling record of educating that group of people. Fewer children are staying on at school after the age of 16 than do so in most Western industrial countries and many of the Eastern bloc countries as well. Fewer of those who leave school at 16 enter courses of education than do so in any other Western industrial country and, again, most of the Eastern bloc as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
It is my view, and the view of others, that that lack of opportunity given to our youngsters is damaging to the youngsters, and also has been a contributory factor in this country's economic decline. We have not been able to provide the technical skills required to enable this country to maintain the lead that it had, say, at the end of the last century in many technical areas. We have slowly declined, and one of the reasons for that has been our inability to train larger numbers after the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why we have not done that is that for the larger part of this century, until the beginning of the 1970s, we were faced with an ever increasing population to educate and limited resources for doing so. We should have been putting more into education. But now the population is no longer rapidly increasing. We are now faced with an education system in which the numbers are declining; they have declined in the primary schools, are declining in the secondary schools and will eventually decline in the post-school sector as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, now that they have the opportunity to spend the same amount of money as has been spent in the past, expand the service to each individual, and adopt a more imaginative approach, have said: " No ". Instead they cut, cut, cut. As a result they will not get the necessary improvement in the development of our service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to look very seriously at the proper use and maintenance of the education resources. The education service is asking not for more money, but for the same amount to provide a considerably better service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point my hon. Friend is making in respect of the global sum available, but the point is that the area that we are talking about is really the most capital intensive and the one that requires per head of student population the greatest amount of money to be spent on it and if we are going to get the breakthrough then we need even more to take account of the falling population figures in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant the global sum, not within each specific area. When the Minister keeps throwing out the statistic that we are spending now more per head in the schools, for instance, than the last Government did, that is a nonsense, because it costs more to educate a child at school at 16, 17 and 18 than it does to educate one at five, six and seven. If there are more pupils in the 16, 17 and 18 range, and fewer in the five, six and seven range, inevitably it will cost more. But if one actually goes into schools one soon appreciates that less money is being spent per pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quite rightly made the point that the issue is not merely of educating the 16 to 18 year olds. It is also about what is done in the schools. I want to refer briefly to his reference to the Munn and Dunning reports. It is very interesting that those two names are always linked and they are used in the same breath. I think we should sometimes separate them and look at what they say separately, rather than together. I know that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
are linked but there is a sense in which we need to look in particular at Munn. The Minister made great play that we needed changes in the syllabus to make it more relevant. It was Munn's job to talk about the syllabus. He then said that abolishing the present O-level, and using the new arrangement changed the syllabus and made it more relevant. It may make the examination system more relevant, but it does not make the syllabus more relevant the subjects that are being taught in schools, and the methods by which those subjects are being taught, remain the same. The Minister is shaking his head, but it does not make the syllabus more relevant if the syllabus. If he can show me what new subjects of study are being brought in—particularly in the core subject area, the compulsory area—I shall be very grateful. But he cannot. No basic change is taking place in the syllabus as a result of Munn. There is a change in the examination system. More pupils may actually get some piece of paper at the end, but it does not change the basic concept of what is taught in schools, and that is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is raising an important point. The whole thing was about providing those children who attended school with a piece of paper, which said nothing about their ability but simply that they had been to school every day. It did nothing for the 47 per cent, of schoolchildren in Scotland who leave school with no O-level certificate. My hon. Friend is correct in saying that it is the actual syllabus which is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point because the major matter that has to be looked at in terms of the Munn and Dunning reports is how to make the syllabus appear more relevant to the pupils in the schools, particularly that large percentage of pupils who do not take examinations. It is not made more relevant simply by using the same basic syllabus and tacking on a piece of paper at the end. That is not enough. Something has to be said about the syllabus. Is my view and in the view of practically every educational body in Scotland—including the EIS, the colleges of education, the Labour Party, the STUC—which commented on the matter, essentially it is an illegal approach which misses the major thesis of what ought to have been done in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to dwell too long on that, but I want to take briefly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) about the problems of declining school rolls. When we talk about 16 to 18 year olds we are not talking merely about those who are in the post-school educational system; we are also talking about those who are still at school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Declining school rolls, as my hon. Friend rightly said, are creating problems. If there are smaller rolls, fewer specialist teachers can be employed, particularly as this Government are insisting that local authorities cut and cut. As a result, in some
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
subjects it will be difficult for schools to maintain the educational service and provision for the post-16 school person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the major problems that the Government's new parental choice will create in certain areas. If some of the brighter people are to leave the schools in our big housing schemes, in our inner urban areas, and go to what parents consider to be better schools, there will be fewer of them staying after the age of 16 and it will be even more difficult for those particular children to be able to stay on at school and take the subjects of their choice. The Government's Bill is aggravating the situation which is being created by the declining school rolls, and that has to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the problems of the 16 to 18 year olds who have left school. I do not intend to do more than refer briefly to colleges of education. Those people between 16 and 18 are those who are at school, those who go into apprenticeships, those who go into further education colleges for other schemes, those who go to firms for other training schemes, those who go to colleges and universities —because some people go to university—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seventeen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seventeen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now I have to remember where I was. I was saying that this area covers a large amount. I said that I would refer briefly to the colleges of education. It is disgraceful that a Minister who says that we may have to consider radical changes in the institutions and so on of post-school education and the links between schools and post-school education and further education should state that, when it is his intention within two years to close down two, if not three, post-school education institutions that could be used in that more imaginative approach that he is looking for, those are the colleges of education. It makes no sense for him to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems that we have and the pious hopes of the Minister are not borne out by the hard facts. I should like to look at one or two areas, and at apprenticeships in particular—a very important area of skill training for the economy and of education for our youngsters. On the Scottish Select Committee we have been looking at this area, and evidence has already been published which would indicate what is happening. In nearly every area, and in very important areas in particular such as engineering, if there ever is to be a pick-up in the economy we shall need more and more skilled people. The number of apprenticeships has been declining rapidly since the present Government came into power. Engineering companies are being hard hit by the recession. They find it extremely difficult to maintain their level of apprenticeships and they are cutting back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
And arguably the Government are making matters worse. The Minister made great play of how the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
youth opportunities programme will get extra funding. In passing, may I comment that the MSC says that it will find it extremely difficult to handle the situation with the money available. But the services training side of the MSC is to have its money cut. It is to get less money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must be careful not to encroach upon industrial training, which does not come within the Estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>. I accept the point, Mr. Gourlay, except that a large amount of industrial training is done through the further education colleges which are run by the local authorities and are funded through the Estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the point, but I am trying to illustrate that this decline in apprenticeships is taking place and that it is dangerous. The Government intend, of course, to cut some industrial training boards, and that will cut training even further. They are moving to a voluntary principle whereby employers will pay for the training. That will perhaps mean a cut in Government money and the employers, rather than the Government, having to fund further education colleges through training schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this will mean fewer apprenticeship opportunities for our youngsters, and fewer people receiving post-school education. The economy will suffer as a result because we shall not have the skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was making the point about industrial training. The Minister said that more emphasis had to be placed on the vocational side of educational needs, I took that to mean that the Government had plans to add to the industrial training side of the educational needs. Perhaps I picked him up wrongly, but he did stress that on two occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have made the remark which the hon. Gentleman attributes to him, but it was in an aside, as it were. It was not really part of the debate and we cannot debate in detail that aspect of the Estimates before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. The apprenticeship schemes and all the training done by firms are so closely linked with the further education colleges and, of course, with SCOTEC, SCOTBEC and such organisations, that it is extremely difficult to differentiate. In fact, your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, brings me to my next point—that one of our problems is this great diversity of controls over the post-school sector. It is difficult for me to talk about the MSC aspect of training because it is not covered by the Scottish Estimates. That comes under the Scottish Office. But 	<i>H</i> uses the further education colleges and they come under the local authorities. Then there are the employers, who have a direct input into training, which again does not come under the Scottish Estimates because funding for that comes under the MSC. The universities are not covered by the Estimates. If I referred to them you would probably say that I was out of order, Mr. Gourlay. The colleges of education come directly under the Government. The central institutions
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
come directly under central Government. The Minister is shaking his head. He knows perfectly well that they come directly under central Government and not local Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am agreeing with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is the only man I know who shows disagreement by shaking his head rather than nodding it. I have to accept the norms in this situation, Mr. Gourlay, and if the Minister shakes his head I have to take it that he is disagreeing with me rather than agreeing. Certainly at that point he was shaking his head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have wide controls and people genuinely do not know which area to move to. The Minister is right—I am not sure that he will get it right if he actually attempts to do it—to say that we need to look at the reform of our education institutions and to try to develop new schemes and new ways of working. The Minister need not feel too complimented, because I am sure that if he tries to tackle it he will get it wrong. He has got everything else wrong so far, so there is no indication that he will get that one right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to the major question of the unemployed —the 1 to 18 year olds who have no jobs. That is the group that we really must tackle seriously. No one would say that we should not have the youth opportunities programme providing work experience and a variety of other forms of activity for these youngsters. That is right. But it is not enough. I shall not make the point—although I know that all my hon. Friends would agree if I did—that the real things is to get the economy moving again and to provide jobs. But, even accepting the present situation, it is not enough simply to provide work experience. We have to produce schemes which actually give training to these youngsters, allow them to continue their education and, at the end of it, to get jobs based upon the training that they have had. That means looking radically at the apprenticeship scheme and at the age entry of apprentices. It means considering whether or not one does it on the time basis, as is done at present, or on a skill basis, as many people giving evidence to the Scottish Select Committee have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have to look at further education. We have to consider whether training should be left entirely in the hands of employers, as so much of it is at present, or whether it should increasingly be the State's responsibility, particularly in times of recession, to ensure that a very much larger number of our youngsters receive skilled training. If we do not get that, when the recession begins to end, we shall not move out of it as fast as other countries simply because we shall not have the skilled manpower to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Youth unemployment is an extreme problem but, as the Minister suggested, it will not decline. I think we shall have it with this Government for some time. Demographically, it will start to fall away over the next few years. But unless we train that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
group now—the Minister must do something now, not in five years' time after consultation—we shall have a mass of untrained unemployable people in the 25, 30 or 40 years age group. It will be an immense problem. But, equally, after 1987-88, we shall have a smaller percentage of the population who can be trained for skills. Therefore, we need this group trained to get an even flow of skilled people into our economy throughout the rest of the century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we fail to ensure that these youngsters—those who left school during the past couple of years and those who will be leaving during the next two or three years are properly trained, Britain and Scotland will be sadly short of the skilled manpower that is required. That is a major lesson which this Government must take on board. We need to educate and train many more of our youngsters. It is not enough for the Minister to make pious statements about what he hopes, after consultation, will take place in three or four years. Action is required now. We require from the Minister some statement about what he will do in the next six months and the next year, not what he will do in the next five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) had to say, because he had nothing really new to say. We listened to it all before on the Education (Scotland) No. 2) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that this morning some Opposition Members, who have considerable experience of industry, further education and the training and development of 16 to 18 year olds, would make contributions. I know that this problem area is one to which they can bring their experience to bear. I think that is what we ought to get in the Committee today. We ought not to be exposed continually to the academic view. The academics have a view, but their view is not the only view that matters. There are also the views of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the nation has a right to expect something in return for the massive sums of public money which are spent on education and training. We must ask ourselves whether we are getting value for the money we are spending now. We should not throw more money at the problems. We should use present funds in a more sensible and realistic way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that in the past 30 years the nation has doubled its share of the gross national product spent on education. In addition, we have had the additional expenditure which is linked through all forms of training. These are massive sums of money. Are we getting value for it? Therefore, I welcome the Government's attitude to Munn and Dunning. I believe that the constructive, positive attitude shown by the Minister can only be helpful in this difficult area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what I believe is an important aspect in this period of great difficulty and change. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
have to accept that the educational establishment will have a view and that its view will be conditioned very much by what it has done in the past, because it is being examined on its record, and that is right. In the educational establishment I would include the Scottish Education Department, the directors of education in all our regions and the administrators responsible for running that aspect of our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we will have the view and the responsibility and accountability of the instructors. In that category I put colleges of education, because they, too, have some responsibility for where we find ourselves today. We have heard a lot about their attitudes and views, but sometime we must talk about their accountability. What, indeed, are they responsible for? What have they been responsible for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now like to turn to others who I believe ought to be considered in this examination. The managers of our schools, the head teachers, have an accountability and responsibility for where we find ourselves today. The views of the teachers, the most important people of all probably, who I believe are least heard—that may surprise the hon. Member for Cathcart; the majority of Scotland's teachers are very good and we are fortunate to have so many dedicated people of high calibre in our schools—are not often heard. The spokespersons are often out of touch with the views of the teachers. Some teachers have been unhappy about some of the changes that have taken place in our schools over the past 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to appreciate what percentage of teachers in schools in Scotland are members of the EIS and the other teachers' organisations. It is somewhere in the region of 60 per cent, to 70 per cent. That is a very large number. Therefore, they represent their views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would merely draw attention to the number teachers who have left that particular organisation because they were unhappy with the path they were travelling. I believe it is right in a debate of this kind that all views should be expressed and all points noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now turn to the parents, who obviously have a view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman, through his many and varied occupations, has wide experience of workers' organisations and the like, but I would make the point that the EIS is not simply involved in the negotiation of wages and conditions. It has a professional role, and to fulfil that professional role it has a wide range of committees, related virtually to all subjects, in which a great number of teachers participate. So, whilst it is not an ideal means of expression for teachers' views, a comprehensive net is cast over teaching opinion before it gives vent to its views. It would be wrong for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that teachers do not have a means of expressing themselves. Sometimes they have too many means and they end up confusing each other.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
It would be wrong to suggest that the teachers' organisations do not provide the means whereby their views can be heard and the vast majority of them take advantage of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting intervention. We heard much of the views of the EIS during the Commitee stage of the Education (Scotland) (No.2) Bill and we have heard more today. I was merely expressing the views of teachers who have contacted me because they were unhappy. I believe it is right that their views should be heard. I was not in any way suggesting that changes should be made to the EIS. The teachers are the only ones who can bring about changes within their own professional bodies. However, I thought that it was necessary to put their view on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that all parents have a desire to see their children in real jobs, given real educational opportunities and prepared for real life. I think the pupils need to be motivated and properly prepared for employment, and this is one of the areas that we ought to be examining very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are the employers. The employers are looking for different degrees of training, different areas of educational aptitude and ability. It is nonsense to pretend that all children can be trained or educated to the same level, because the rate of absorption and the natural instinctive abilities of children differ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We require individuals with scientific or technical skills, administrative skills and tactile skills. Never let us underrate the tactile skills of women and men and boys and girls in our productive industries. Without them we would not enjoy the standard of living that we have today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also remember that 70 per cent. of all those in the 16 to 19 age group will not be academics. They will not have an academic bent. But that does not mean that they are failures in real life. It is nonsense to pretend that is so. Indeed, I suggest that many of them would lead those who claim to be and are academics in terms of the way they behave as members of our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the aspect of the industrial training boards which are on the receiving end of trying to rectify some of the failures of our schools. They have made their views well known to the Select Committee which has been looking into the problems of the young unemployed. It would be a brave member of that Committee who would say that the industrial training boards were happy with the products of our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the universities, which cater for the more gifted of our youngsters—the high flyers. I do not think the debate today should be too concerned with that particular area, because that is not the real problem area, although it presents some problems for the universities in terms of how they will manage within the present financial constrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn now to the colleges of further education. I must declare an interest here, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
I obtained my professional qualifications through colleges of further education, as indeed did many Opposition Members. I have also taught in colleges of further education in many parts of the country over a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has a long and distinguished record in its colleges of further eduction. In recent times we have seen the numbers increase dramatically and the course content change substantially. I believe that some question marks must be put against the courses and the course content. The old technical colleges did a superb and marvellous job. I wonder whether the present colleges of further education are doing the job with the same degree of excellence. I have grave doubts about that. We have spent a lot of money and introduced many new courses. But I wonder whether those courses are geared to, and properly structured for the needs of our modern world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be mindful of the fact that technical colleges are catering for the courses that he is talking about. The colleges that we are discussing—the ones that have been closed—were dealing with pupils at the academic level. But we still have technical colleges for the youngsters who move on to work in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I have not in any way suggested that our technical colleges are not doing their job. I was talking about colleges of further education and the many new types of courses that have been introduced in further education. I put a question mark against the relevance of many of those courses relative to the needs of youngsters and of our modern society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Macleiunan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give us an example of the kind of courses that he does not think are relevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may make a wide sweeping answer to such a substantial question, I would include the many areas of the social sciences. I put a question mark again them in preparing youngsters for the real world today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The criticism which has been made of the City and Guilds examinations at lower tier colleges has been that the general educational element in these courses is not subject to a serious enough consideration in terms of assessment, and that it is almost an optional part of the course. If the hon. Member is criticising the social science element—for want of a better expression—within the City and Guilds courses, for example, which is probably the biggest single element in apprenticeships, that is legitimate if he wants to take up the argument that they are not treated seriously enough. But if he thinks that they take up too much time in the colleges and he wants them done away with, that is a completely different set of circumstances. Before the hon. Member moves on, it would be interesting to know which of the two options he would prefer in respect of the training of young
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
people. As regards the general education departments which service the City and Guilds courses, is he in favour of that general education element of the course being removed completely or is he in favour of that element in the course being beefed up, being made academically more respectable, and being made a condition of the granting of a certificate and a qualification at the end of the course? Those are the two options. That, not the general broad brush nonsense that we are getting from him, is what the debate is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a most interesting intervention. I happen to have spent some years on the City and Guilds advisory committee on examinations. If the hon. Member believes that these are the only options available he knows very little about getting the correct balance in these things. I shall leave it at that because I believe observations have been made elsewhere about whether or not the hon. Member is the most suitable individual to be the spokesman for education on the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I speak emotively on this, Mr. Gourlay, I apologise. It is because I feel very strongly about the needs of the 16 to 19 year olds who are going into industry. Our job is to prepare them for that particular area so that they can achieve of their best, and I do not believe we can do that by treating them as if they are a bunch of potential academics. Primarily they want to develop their skills to a degree that will reward them in life and in their jobs. I feel very strongly about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will conclude. There is much more I should like to say but I know that other members want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have to acknowledge that our educational system has failed many of our 16 to 19 year olds. We must ask why this is so when we have doubled the amount of money spent on education in the last 30 years. What are we doing wrong? We must examine the matter critically. Therefore I welcome the Government's positive attitude to Munn and Dunning because that will be helpful. I believe that we must look at changes in the apprenticeship scheme which will put a special and difficult demand on organised labour—the trade unions. I have every confidence, and I must put this on record, that within the trade unions there are sufficient individuals who care about the future of young people, and they will see that the necessary changes are made in the apprenticeship schemes to meet the needs of the young people, of industry and of the country. I am confident that this will happen. I do not believe that it will happen easily. It will be a difficult road. There will be tough negotiations and it will be necessary for some to give way. Equally it will be necessary for some in education to admit that perhaps over some years they have made a substantial number of mistakes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
the Minister for an apparent discourtesy by not being here at the start of the debate. I was in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I had a number of amendments to table. I wanted to do that before coming here. I must say that when I came here and saw the familiar faces around, it occurred to me that the burden of many Committees seems to fall upon relatively few broad backs. That is one of the most important topics facing us. It is one of the most worrying concerning the future acceptance of our democratic system. I recently spoke to a number of unemployed young people in my constituency and elsewhere. The sense of despair and despondency among them was most frightening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any members of the Committee—I am sure Labour members have had the opportunity, and I hope Conservative members will take the opportunity—talk to these young people they will realise that the way in which the Government's policies are currently affecting them is frightening. A time bomb is ticking away, because these young people are beginning to have no faith in our democratic system. That is worrying for our future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Fife)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon.

It is about children at school between the ages of 16 and 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. With respect, it is about the availability of education and training for young people between the ages of 16 and 19—not merely those at school. Also it relates to the people for whom education and training are not available and for whom jobs are not available. These unemployed people are those for whom education and training or employment are not available. Therefore it is relevant.

May I deal with the point made by the hon. Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There seems to be a little dubiety as to what is in order and what is not.

It would be in order to make some slight reference to unemployment, but basically we are dealing with the allocation of money to the Education Department in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, Mr. Gourlay. May I deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). The intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell (Mr. Hamilton) really put the hon. Gentleman on the spot and showed up his appalling ignoranace of what is happening in Scottish further education today. I know a number of colleges of further education. I know that he has vast experience; we hear about it every time. We are amazed and always quite impressed by his experience. But he does not seem to know what is going on in our further education colleges today.

These old colleges—whether they used to be the old Ramsay tech or whatever— they are in new buildings but it is the same kind of courses that are being made available in motor mechanics and all the various things that he would like to see. The worrying thing is that when many of these kids go through their apprenticeships, through their training, through all the courses in the colleges, there are no jobs at the end of the day. That is causing the despair. It is not merely the despair and despondency among young people who left school without qualifications; it is people who have gone through the whole system, who have taken advantage of education and training, and who then end up without a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with Lord Swann, formerly Sir Michael Swann, who was principal of Edinburgh University, on the need for manpower planning. He is one of the foremost advocates of the need to ensure that we are training the right number of people for the jobs that will be available. I have asked on a number of occasions and I ask again today if the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland will indicate the areas in Scotland in which jobs will be available. They mentioned some specifically, such as microelectronics at places like Digital, Prestwick Circuits, British Aerospace and one or two others. But I submit that these are few compared with those being destroyed in all the other areas of industry, as is evidenced by the present level of unemployment. What is being done to relate the whole series of training measures, the whole series of educational provisions within our colleges and universities, to the new jobs that will be available? We have heard so much about manpower planning in teacher training and no doubt the Minister will raise that point. But what about all the other areas of training? What planning is being done to relate the training of the young people to the jobs that will ultimately be available? Whenever we ask in what areas new jobs will be available, Ministers are strangely silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was speaking about freedom of choice. This is the most appalling measure brought forward by any Government on education in Scotland. Perhaps some of my hon. Friends do not feel as strongly about it as I do. But I am sure that in practice we shall see the destruction of some of our schools. Some of our secondary schools will be unable to maintain the whole range of educational provision, particularly for the 16 to 19 year olds. Because of declining rolls it is already difficult to maintain the provision in some schools. But if there is the movement away that will certainly come as a result of the provisions of the Education (Scotland) Act, some schools will be totally deprived. Schools that are already deprived in many other ways will lose able pupils and will be unable to offer the whole range of provisions for the 16 to 19 age range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard the Government come forward with any proposals for dealing with this. I have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
heard any new thinking by the Government. On this side of the Committee there have been suggestions over a period for the development of community schools, for developing a school like Wester Hailes as an education centre. It provides a whole range of opportunities, not just for pupils between the ages of five to 16 or 18, but for the whole community. That means that it is possible to sustain the courses, even with a declining school roll and a relatively small number in the 16 to 19 age range taking normal school education and wanting a particular specialist course. People generally come back to the education centre to take advantage of the courses. Therefore there is much greater demand and much greater opportunity to provide these specialist courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this is the kind of thing that is being destroyed by the Government's policy. Community schools and education centres like Wester Hailes are under severe pressure because of the cuts in public expenditure which the Governemnt are forcing upon local authorities. Community schools need more resources and more money. We accept that because they provide more facilities for a wider range of people. Yet the Government through their expenditure policy are cutting back on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is a jungle of provision for the 16 to 19 year olds. I had the opportunity recently to read two reports—one by the Manpower Services Commission on a new initiative for the 16 to 19 year olds, and the other by the Macfarlane committee on the 16 to 19 year olds in England and Wales. It seems to me that, far from the Government bringing all the different strands together and trying to move towards some kind of overview, some kind of unified provision, some kind of planning, the opposite is taking place. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. The Manpower Services Commission is out of step with the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard some hon. Gentlemans say that in Scotland we have a unique opportunity for bringing these things together, because in one person, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher), we have industry and education brought together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how sport comes comes into it. There seems to be no other reason for giving that particular person such a wide range of responsibilities when he is manifestly unable to carry out one of them. Assuming that there is something to be gained from having these two subjects combined I hope that it might be in the form of some kind of overview of provision for the 16 to 19-year-olds. There is no evidence whatsoever that that is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the reply which the Minister might give he will disabuse us of that and I would certainly welcome the opportunity that since we have this unique position of having one man in overall control of these things that we will see a unique initiative in Scotland, but I predict that we shall have to wait an awful long time before we get an initiative from that particular person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not think that in rising to speak on this I am venting the frustrations I experienced listening to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) for endless hours on the Committee considering the Education Bill, but that is certainly part of my reason for doing so. When one deals with education in Scotland it is, for the outsider from time to time, little more than an administrative morass. I come from the legal profession, and I know that we lawyers are always told that we are most exclusive in our attitude to the way other people can look into our affairs. We pale by comparison to those who believe that education is wholly their exclusive preserve. Most alarming of all is that when we try to discover the Opposition view in Scotland on the direction that my hon. Friend should be taking, it is extremely difficult to know who speaks with the true voice. Is it the unfortunate hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) who got a terrific duffing up when he went to the Labour Party conference on education in Perth earlier this year? He was following in the steps of his hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) who the previous year got a greater duffing up when he went to the same fringe meeting. It really makes the best reading in the education scene in Scotland every year wondering who is going to be the next luckless victim. It appears to be something of a graveyard for aspiring, ambitious young Labour politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, through it all we see, with his mantle as the philosopher-teacher, untouched and pure, the hon. Member for Cathcart who, in spite of all that he has to say—all his radical initiatives, beautiful changes, and reforms, for which we have waited for more than a century—stands, as can be seen from his speech this morning and what he said during the Committee stage of the Education Bill, for nothing more than the true forces of reaction in Scottish education. He is obsessed with the ideas of the existing institutions. It certainly seems to us on the Government side that he believes he is the only one putting forward any valid views on education. That causes his hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) to suffer paroxysms of fury from time to time. His hon. Friend was the great educator-administrator in Lothian region. Unfortunately he is presently translated to the other coast. But for all that breadth of experience as an educator-administrator, the seamless garment of the hon. Member for Cathcart obscures any contribution that he might have to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that I have asked my hon. Friend about from time to time is maths in industry. I asked him about it because there is a pilot project on the development of a curriculum in Tayside region. I have asked him on a number of occasions about that and he has repeatedly said that it is an extremely exciting, innovative idea and he would encourage every other education authority in Scotland to pursue the same line of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of maths for industry is by no means a new one, but why has it been necessary that this
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
awful, reactionary education authority in Tayside is the only one that seems to think it is important to develop such a scheme? What on earth has been going on in Scottish education for all this time that a simple project like that requires to have the encouragement of the Minister for education before all the education authorities in Scotland will pursue it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People such as the hon. Member for Cathcart— and I hope he does not think I am getting at him— with an obsession for existing institutions, fail to perceive what is a very considerable problem in the existing institutions. First of all, there is complete chaos in certain circumstances with the conflicting institutions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly obvious that the hon. Member must have been out of the room for most of my speech. I made it quite clear that I was not happy with existing institutions and wanted change in the way in which controls take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I had been out of the room, but I was not. Dundee is the only place about which I can speak with any great knowledge, and there have been endless efforts there to rationalise the institutions that are dealing with the education of youngsters in the 16 to 18 age group. And because of the reactionary character of what is put forward endlessly by the hon. Member for Cathcart, nothing is done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply a matter of an administrative morass. Within that age group there is that academic drift occurring the whole time within those existing institutions, leading eventually to BScs in bricklaying. What we are trying to do is to make sure that there are opportunities for children to be trained to their own level of achievement and talent to find jobs that are fulfilling to them and worthwhile. But with the academic drift that exists the problem is becoming more acute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is right to insist that there is a great immediacy about this problem, and I hope that we can adjust to it flexibly and quickly. One of the interesting things that has been pointed out to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and which can be seen in the statistical documents that have been put before us today is that in a sense we are dealing with a temporary problem. It is a very acute one, but if we are dealing with numbers, as the hon. Member for Cathcart pointed out, by the time we get to 1990 the real numbers in that age group will have dramatically declined. Again, given that reactionary character which the hon. Member so clearly characterises, what worries me is that if we build up institutions that are rigid and inflexible, we shall find ourselves in five or six years time with exactly the same problem as existed when we tried some years ago to give a temporary impetus to teacher training and increase the number of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is essential that we look at the problem in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been quoting extensively the aspects of the Tayside educational policy that he likes. Surely he is aware
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
of Tayside's response to the Minister on this subject which says that flexibility in necessary between the various levels of colleges and schools. But the hon. Gentleman has conveniently forgotten to say that Tayside insisted that a prerequisite if this flexibility was to come about was the need for more money. How does he handle that one with his hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The institutions are confused and overlapping. The hon. Member knows that perfectly well. I have promised to finish within a couple of minutes because the hon. Member for West Stirlinghire, (Mr. Canavan), the next sacrificial victim to go to Perth, wishes to give us a foretaste of what he will be saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart referred briefly and with confusion to the problems of apprentices. Yet again he gets himself tangled up in the jargon of the educator, taking radical looks at it all. He knows perfectly well that there is no need to take a radical look at apprenticeships. What needs to be done is what they have done in West Germany, that is, to take apprenticeships out of collective bargaining, so that the marginal cost of training young people is not so distorted as it is in the United Kingdom. That requires to be done, and against that I accept that apprenticeships need to be better integrated into the education system. But I expect that that suggestion, coming from an hon. Member like myself is, to the hon. Member for Cathcart, far too radical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very interesting and important debate, a debate about a very important section of our community—young people between the ages of 16 and 19. Many of them are school leavers who have left school in the past few weeks. Some of them may be leaving school today or tomorrow, and this debate is being held against the background of a very severe depression. The outlook for the economy is very depressing and for many young people leaving school is most depressing indeed. On Tuesday of this week it was announced that unemployment in Scotland now tops the 300,000 mark, including 27,400 young school leavers. At least a quarter of those unemployed are between the ages of 16 and 19. That means that the total unemployed in that age range is over 75,000. In other words—just to give an idea of how many young people I am referring to—that number would just about fill the terraces at Hampden Park. That is the magnitude of the problem of youth unemployment faced in Scotland at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the importance of this topic, would the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the attendance on the Government side has been something about which the hon. Member can be very proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
Again, looking at the statistics released on Tuesday last, in the month of June only 300 vacancies were notified to careers offices in Scotland. That means, if we take the number of vacancies and divide by the number of young school leavers alone, that we have over 90 young school leavers chasing every notified vacancy in Scotland at the present time. It seems from some remarks by the Prime Minister on Tuesday that she is making some kind of excuse that there are far too many people leaving school. I do not know whether she wants to abolish people to get rid of unemployment, but—even from the Minister's own handout here from the Scottish Education Department—it is clear that the number of young school leavers is already beginning to drop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the figures from Strathclyde, for example, covering half of Scotland's population, the secondary roll will drop from over 200,000 at the present time down to 122,000 by the year 1991-92, that is a decrease of almost 40 per cent, in the secondary school population. What is particularly worrying is that if the present trends continue, despite the drop in the number of school leavers, there will be an actual increase in the number of unemployed school leavers, and an even bigger increase in the proportion of unemployed school leavers. But there is no sign of any significant increase in the proportion of young people in education or training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I got a reply on Monday last from the Minister, when he said that the Government were encouraging the trend for more 16 to 18 year olds to remain in full time education. Yet the same day he released statistics to me which showed quite clearly that the percentage of young people in the age group of 16 to 19 in full-time education is 30 per cent., which is even less than it was in 1976-77. Again, according to the figures, the proportion of young people in that age group who are in part-time education is 20.6 per cent., which is even lower than it was back in 1972-73. As my hon. Friend says, about half of the age group that they were talking about are undergoing no education or training. That compares very unfavourably with many other industrialised countries. In West Germany, for example, virtually every youngster in that age group is undergoing education or training on a full or part-time basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost 10 years since the raising of the school leaving age, and yet the proportion of 16 to 19 year olds has actually dropped since then from 21T per cent, in 1972-73 to 20-3 per cent, in 1979-80. That does not say much for our efforts to make secondary education more appealing and more relevant to the needs of young people. For a long time our educational system, particularly in the latter years of secondary school education, was geared to pupils in certificate classes, many of whom hoped to proceed to further or higher education. But recent trends even in that field are far from satisfactory. According to the Minister's statistics, of the 16 to 19 year old age group, 3·2 per cent. were at university in 1979-80, which was lower than the percentage for each of the previous two years, and 2.1 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
cent. were undergoing advanced further education in the same year, which was lower than the percentage for the academic year 1972-73. So even in the narrow fields of higher education and advanced further education, there is no room for complacency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the rest of the young people at secondary schools, the majority of whom do not do highers? Some may do O-grades and, despite what the Minister said about the O-grade being originally intended for the top 30 per cent, of the ability range, about three-quarters of those in the fourth year of secondary education are presented for at least one O-grade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and others hope that, if and when the Munn and Dunning reports are fully implemented, that will make for a more meaningful curriculum and give more opportunities to many of these young people, particularaly those who are not able to benefit fully from an O-grade course. But I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said about the need for more re sources and more training and retraining of teachers. I also express the fear of some people, including some teachers with great experience of dealing with these young people, that the way in which Munn and Dunning are implemented by the Government may lead to further stratification and substratification of young people. That will mean that some of them may find it increasingly difficult to transfer from one course to another— from the foundation course to the general course, or from the general course—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also accept that the syllabus proposed by Munn as being the core syllabus in particular, will lead to exactly the sort of academic drift referred to by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) among pupils who should be getting subjects other than the pure academic ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is a great fear that that may happen. I hope that the Minister uses his inspectorate well to assess and monitor the situation in the pilot schemes before going for the full implementation of Munn and Dunning as he proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even before Munn and Dunning, some schools piloted the way with link courses to further education, some including work experience. I have always believed that education is not simply training for a job, but nevertheless the vocational element in the latter school years is particularly relevant in order to stimulate interest amongst young people. Career guidance is also important. Young people may find it difficult to make up their minds about what career to aim at in these days of high uneemployment. The system of career guidance and, of course, the structure of education and training ought to be as flexible as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said something about the possibility of structural changes, but in his consultative document he ruled out any possibility of expansion of the system because he said that we could not have any increase in resources. He forgot to point out
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
that it is not just an increase in resources because one of the first things that he did when he came to ministerial office was to cut £3-9 million of the further education student awards on the youth services. He did that within a matter of weeks of taking office in New St. Andrew's House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that a lot of good educational ideas are sometimes thrown out because they cost money, particularly these days when he have a Government which is hell-bent on cutting even useful public expenditure. But I hope that there would be agreement on both sides of the Committee about the need for better co-ordination which would lead to more efficient use of existing resources. The present system of post-school education does seem to me to be a bit too complex and fragmented. In Scotland we have inherited a multiplicity of different kinds of educational institutions in the post-school sector. There are those universities the central institutions, art, music, and drama, and other more technical institutions such as colleges of building, printing, nautical studies, agriculture, and so on. There may well have been good historical reasons for these colleges. I am sure that most of them do a very good job. But I suspect that some of them may be a bit too specialist and that facilities for entry and transfer between the colleges are not what they should be. I hope that when the Council for Tertiary Education reports it will come out with strong recommendations which will lead to a more comprehensive system of post-school education leading to better co-ordination between the different institutions and making entry, re-entry and transfer much easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as I call for facility for transfer and of entry in the institutions, I do so also for the system of training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some criticisms have been made of the youth opportunities programme and weighted schemes such as community industry. It would be unfair to say that all these schemes were meaningless. For example, I visited a scheme in my constituency on Friday. It was the opening of a new recreation and sports club and the building had been provided by young people on the community industry scheme, a scheme which I helped to get started in the old Stirling constituency before I became a Member of Parliament. It is nonsense to claim that all the jobs that these young people are doing are meaningless. The fruits are there for people to see if they go to look at them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, there are grounds for concern about the lack of meaningful training content in some of the jobs. I hope that the Minister resists the pressure from some of the backwoodsmen in his own party about some of their crazy schemes involving National Service, military training and the like. We want more apprenticeships. We ought to be ashamed that we have the lowest proportion of apprenticeships in the working population of any country in the Common Market with the exception of the Republic of Ireland. I would like to see the Minister having discussions with the trade unions and others with a view to having a more flexible approach
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
about entry to apprenticeships so that the apprenticeships will be based on the attainment of adequate standards rather than simply on time served or the age that a person happens to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second criticism I would make of the Youth Opportunities Programme is that very often there is no job at the end of it. In 1980, we are told, about 70 per cent, of those leaving the Youth Opportunities Programme found employment. But there is increasing evidence from the Institute of Careers Officers and others to suggest that that percentage is diminishing rapidly and is now only about 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third criticism of the Youth Opportunities Programme is that very often these places are substituted for real jobs. There are complaints that this is widespread. I have been given a figure that for every five YOP trainees enrolled, one worker is replaced. So it is no wonder that there are allegations that employers are abusing the YOP to hire young people as cheap labour. The allowance is £23-50 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice from the front page of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> today that there was a demonstration outside St. Andrew's House in Edinburgh by teenagers who work a 45-hour week for £23-50 under the youth opportunities programme. Some of the training they received was reported to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"sweeping up and washing dishes ".</p></blockquote>
I notice that one of your constituents, Mr. Gourlay—a Miss Helen Laurie, of Sauchenbush Road, Kirkcaldy—is quoted as saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>" someone aged 18 who chose not to work under the scheme could receive £19-20 a week in benefit and be eligible for other benefits such as cheap or free bus travel … Young people who joined the scheme had to pay the first £4 a week of the cost of travelling to work, and had to pay for lunches while at work."</p></blockquote>
There seems to me to be a lack of incentive there. I should like to see the Minister having regard to this whole business of remuneration for 16 to 18 year olds, whether they are in work, in training or in education, because there is a disincentive at present to stay on at school or to continue education in another institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even greater disincentive to sit examinations at school now because the DHSS has come out with new regulations which mean that young people who stay on to sit their O-grades disqualify themselves for receiving supplementary benefit until after the end of the school holiday. That is very unfair. The best way to go about this would be to get a comprehensive system of educational maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuanie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up the point that the hon. Gentleman mentioned about the young person who decided not to go to work as against the young person who did. It is very commendable that young people do go to work in view of the lower earnings. It shows a great interest in wanting a job. But is it not better, because of this business of voluntary decision, that any scheme evolved for 16 to 19 year olds, be
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
it partial education or partial training in industry or otherwise, should be compulsory, not voluntary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would be against compulsion in this regard. The aim should be to establish a comprehensive programme whereby all young people in that age group are guaranteed a job, education or training, and an adequate income or maintenance allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot see the need for radical change in this direction, he is closing his eyes to reality, because the economic consequences of the Government's policy are such that, even when the economic recovery comes—and we shall have to wait for a change of Government before it does come—it appears that as a nation we shall not be adequately equipped and trained. Even the CBI is talking about a lost generation of young people being rejected by our system of education and training. When the economic recovery comes the danger is that we shall not have the trained and skilled manpower to cope with it. If the Minister cannot see the economic consequences, perhaps he will bear in mind the social consequences of tolerating thousands more unemployed young people roaming the streets with nothing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote from a book by Lesley Gow and Andrew McPherson of the department of education sociology at Edinburgh university. It consists of the writings of many of these young people, and I recommend it as reading for everyone in the Committee. One boy, unemployed for nine months, writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have been looking in most every place … for jobs and I still haven't had a job. Sometimes I sit in the house with nothing to do and other times I go out with my friends who are also on the dole. When we go about the streets the police usually pick us up for no reason at all. Some people think we are too lazy to work but little do they know."</p></blockquote>
How many thousands of young people in Scotland feel the same way as that young lad that I have just quoted. They must feel rejected by the education system. They are denied the right to work; they are denied the opportunity to find a useful role in life. Is it any wonder that many of them feel a growing resentment against the society which is denying them this opportunity? Is it not almost inevitable that some of them may feel tempted to take their resentment out against society in some anti-social form?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would never encourage young people to do that. I would never encourage younge people, however dejected they may feel, to reject the rest of society. But I would encourage all of these young people to reject the Government, because the Government have rejected them by denying them the opportunity which is their birthright. The message from the Government is a message of no hope. It seems to me that they arc willing to sacrifice a whole generation of young people in a vain attempt to prove some unprovable economic doctrine which has become an obsession in the mind of a demented woman in 10 Downing Street. If the Minister is too blind to see the economic and political consequences of what the Government are doing, let him look at the devastating social consequences. I warn him that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
it is about time for even the present Government to change course before it is too late, because the social damage that they are doing to a generation of young people may well be irreparable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

No Member can claim for a moment that he is totally devoid of any responsibility for the employment situation in Scotland today. I will quote one statistic to support that. Labour costs in this country have risen by 40 per cent, in the past two years compared with an average increase in labour costs for our competitors of 12 per cent. We started at a disadvantage with our competitiveness, and we have compounded it. For as long as we price ourselves out of markets, we shall price ourselves and our young people out of jobs.

The other agreement which I sensed across the Committee this morning was of impatience with the present institutional structure of education in Scotland, particularly as it relates to 16 to 18 year olds, the subject of our debate. It was particularly well described by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) when he talked about the size of the resources of all kinds which are available, but then drew our attention to the overlapping, the rigidities and the boundaries which prevent young people from getting the full benefit and advantage of the large resources which successive Governments have provided for this age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In criticising some of the courses that are available in what he described, quite rightly, as education drift, he gave the illustration of a BSc in bricklaying. That was a valid point. It must concern all of us when we see the over-bureaucracy of some of our educational institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) talked about an expansion of resources. We argue that a better use of existing resources could go a very long way to resolving the problems that we have, not the least of which is an inflexibility in the use of existing resources. In fact, an expansion of existing resources would merely expand the overlapping and confusion in this sector of education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the constructive attitude adopted by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire in winding up the debate because he, too, shared with hon. Members on both sides of the Committee an impatience with the general structure and organisation of our educational institutions, particularly as they affect this group. I agree entirely with his impatience with the old-fashioned structure of apprenticeships. Nothing is more harmful to training in this country than that it is time served rather than standards attained which counts in craft and industrial training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of the age bar—the fact that if a young person misses an apprenticeship
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
at the age of 16 or 17 he is condemned never to be recognised as a properly-trained engineer or joiner or whatever. I therefore welcome the support that the hon. Member gives me in the consultations that we are currently conducting in an effort to get a relaxation of these attitudes and rigidities in the education and training system. He wished me well in my talks with the trade unions, and I very much welcome his support. I am sure that if I run into any difficulties with any of the trade unions, he will be the first to leap to my defence.

The hon. Gentleman quoted some figures that I should not like to ignore, even though only such a short time is available. The number of students on courses of advanced or further education, both full-time and part-time, has continued to increase over the past few years. Between 1973-74 and 1978-79 there was a 51 per cent, increase in students on these courses, due in part to the development of improved and new full-time courses at diploma and degree level set to widen the opportunities for appropriately qualified school leavers. The number of students on courses of full-time non-advanced vocational further education has also increased by two-thirds over the same period. These figures are contained in the statistical bulletin published last month by the Scottish Education Department. Of course, I recognise that these increases are due in part to the increases in the prospect of unemployment among school leavers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also say, in response to an intervention by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), that Scotec and Scotbec hope to have pilot courses available for the less able sector of the age group with which we are concerned in 1982-83. I am sure that will greatly encourage the hon. Gentleman, because he was demanding that there should be quicker action. These courses have been designed for young people over the age of 16, and if education authorities wish to introduce them for school pupils, they will be free to do so. The courses will be available in schools as well as in further education colleges.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) defined the problem of the 16 to 18 year olds and its history in his usual professional way. He told us of the many years during which the Labour Party and the STUC in Scotland had been passing resolutions about the problem. But he was completely unable to point to any action taken by a Labour Government to resolve the problem. That is fairly typical. But, more seriously, the hon. Gentleman underplayed the Munn and Dunning reports by ignoring the differentiation between levels of ability. The fundamental value of the Munn and Dunning proposals will allow children to study subjects at their own personal level of ability. That is better than at present when many children find themselves bored at school because the O-grade examinations are not suited to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also alleged what no new courses were being brough in under Munn and Dunning. Munn dealt with the curriculum, not the syllabus, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. But we are developing multi-disciplinary courses at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
foundation level in the areas of social and vocational skills, health studies and contemporary society. These are relevant to adult life and to the world of work. They give the prospect of qualifications to those who, under the present system, have no chance of achieving qualifications, because of the way the educational system in structured.

My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) in his contribution to the debate was able to speak to the Committee both as a former student of further education colleges
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
and as a former lecturer in further education colleges. I agree with him that the value of these —not least the value of what we used to call the " techs "—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
