	<p>	<i>Question proposed [22 January],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned last Thursday, I was asking several questions. Having read what the Minister said earlier in that debate, I note that some questions asked by my hon Friends, and notably by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), were not answered by the Minister, either in anticipation or subsequently. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer the questions from both Labour and Conservative Members on why the composition of the advisory council is being changed, and particularly why it is now possible, although it was not before, for the Secretary of State to put local authority representatives in a minority on that council. I asked whether the Minister would explain the source of that proposal. We have not been told that, and it would be interesting to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that when the Minister made his original statement he argued that when the original membership was proposed in the 1956 Act there were many more valuation authorities then than there are now and that, therefore, the work had reduced. He said that that was reflected in the fact that the council did not meet often. In other words, the Minister argued that the advisory council was less busy that it was, which makes it all the more strange that the Government should now propose an increase in the membership of a body which is doing less work and meeting less frequently. Indeed, the Minister went on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the council has lost one of its original functions—that of considering administrative schemes for valuation in each area."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 22 January 1981; c. 155.]</p></blockquote>
I support the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) in this sense: if a body exists for no apparent good reason, why should it not only continue to exist but have its membership increased? The Minister says that it is doing valuable work, and it may be that it would be sorely missed if it were abolished, but I should like to hear the Minister assert that we simply could not go on without it. If that is true, can the Minister tell us whether the Prime Minister knows that the Government are now asserting that there should be a more than 6 per cent, increase in the total membership of a quango in Scotland? Does Sir Derek Rayner, the Marks and
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
Spencer tycoon who is now investigating such matters, know of that proposition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that a Government Department should be going behind the Prime Minister's back and deliberately and with malice aforethought seeking to increase the membership. [Hon Members: "No."] Maybe that is too cruel, but there is some defiance of the Prime Minister's intentions to cut down on civil servants and quangos, as the Government are now doing. The Scottish Office is acting contrary to that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reply to some of the questions, not least on the cost of the council. I hope that he will put on record the daily expenses of those who sit on it and what the council cost in 1956—I am sure that he does not have that figure—because he said that the work was much greater before 1956 than it has been since. Therefore, he must have comparative figures on which to base that assertion, and he must provide them, to let us see how the work of this organisation has reduced and whether that has been reflected in reduced costs. In any case, it would be interesting for the Committee to know the total annual cost over the last two or three years to see just how big is the burden being imposed on the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are very concerned about this matter, because they have a certain preoccupation at the moment about all committees and bodies which are appointed and about the split between the bodies and the proportions which have been allocated. We come to this clause again this morning, perhaps sadder but wiser, to consider what may become the minority position of local authority representatives on the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we do not have even crude, democratic methods such as the block vote to help us arrive at representation on a body we are dependent upon the patronage of Ministers. In this instance, we have a small amount of confidence—not a great deal—in the Minister's alleged fairness. That is not a compliment that we would extend to many other members of this Government. Nevertheless, we almost trust him. We realise that, as a man of honour, he might well be able to act fairly in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are concerned about the dangers of infiltration. I think that it is fair to say that there are probably more interests waiting to take advantage of any opportunity in the world of property speculation than in any other area. Certainly on important bodies such as the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council it is right to question the infiltration of people from unrepresentative and politically-motivated groups such as ratepayers' associations, who masquerade as non-political and certainly would not be afforded the charitable status that we were seeking for some reputable bodies in our debate last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the creeping infiltration of the capitalist elements in the property market in the form of the estate agents who have already begun to appear in this body and who, as far as I can see, do not represent professional organisations but represent simply themselves. I may be wrong, and the Minister may be able to tell us how Mr. Hall and Mr. Barr, whom I imagine to be very reputable members of the profession, were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
appointed and whether they are there through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or are appointed simply because they are friends of the Conservative Party. I imagine that the two need not be incompatible. We are entitled to know how the other members have been put on this council, if only because in days gone by it has been clear that the majority have come through COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman asked whether the two gentlemen in question were friends of the Conservative Party. I do not know whether they are, but he may be interested to know that they were appointed by the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We make mistakes just as any other party does. They may well be honourable men. I was more interested in finding out whether they were representatives of a professional body or were appointed simply as people involved in a business. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can get the Civil Servants behind him to give some assistance in this matter, so that we can get the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not oppose the clause it will be because a reasonable method of appointment has been adopted. If the functions of the council are to be reduced there is probably a case for reducing the numbers of councillors. If the interest groups are reduced as a result of local government reorganisation there is a case for reducing the number of local government representatives. But no argument has yet been made for reducing the number of local government representatives as a controlling element in the council. Perhaps the phrase "controlling element" is a hard way of putting it, as committees of this nature rarely resort to voting, but if we are to have quangos—surely we all recognise that it is only in Sir Derek Rayner's wildest dreams that we should see the abolition of all of them—they must be seen to be tightly organised and to represent to the fullest possible extent organisations which are, even at one stage removed, democratically accountable. In local government such people come up for re-election and sometimes re-selection from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland COSLA, which enjoys some status, has the capacity to bring together all local government interests—the dominating influences in the valuation authorities. It is our contention that COSLA should retain a dominating influence in the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reluctance to accept the amendment or to think again about the composition of the council makes us reluctant to support him. We may not divide on this issue, but we are disappointed that legislation may be passed to increase the size of a quango for no apparent reason and at the same time reduce that element of democratic accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of patronage—albeit exercised in an enlightened and progressive manner by the previous Administration—is dangerous in the wrong hands, and we believe that it is dangerous so to taint a body of this stature. It would be far better for the Minister to rethink the matter, as he has generously agreed to do on other issues. A smaller council with a majority of local government representatives that took into account the changed circumstances of local govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
ment and work load would, nevertheless, enshrine the principle of a majority representation from the valuation authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has a fundamental misconception of the role of persons nominated by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities who might serve on the valuation advisory council. There is nothing in the rules, nor in the practice of local authorities, that requires nominated persons to be elected members. COSLA has had experience of nominating persons who were not councillors to serve on the council. There is no question of the Secretary of State giving patronage and the convention dealing with elected members. It is a question of appointing people and who does the appointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) and my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) asked, correctly, whether the Government had reviewed the need for this quango and whether there was a case for continuing with it. I can assure both of them the matter received close scrutiny, and our view is that a body to advise on valuation matters is still needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past four years the cost of the council has been very modest. In 1977 its expenses were £206; in 1978, £146; in 1979, £332 and in 1980, £103. The reason for the slight fluctuation is straightforward: one of the convention's nominees lives in Orkney, and his expenses accounted for 65 per cent, of the total cost in 1977 and 51 per cent, in 1979. He did not attend the meetings held in 1978 and 1980. Hon Members will see that even when the worthy member from Orkney attends, the expenses of the council are very modest, and so expense was not a major factor when the Government were considering the council's future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we take it that those figures will not prejudice the appointment of representatives from island authorities in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I can give the hon Gentleman an absolute assurance on that point, because I understand that the gentleman from Orkney was suggested to the convention by the then Secretary of State. It is clearly desirable that the island authorities, whose interest in valuation matters is not necessarily the same as that of the mainland, should at least at some times have representation on this council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend tell me whether those figures cover only the expenses of the council or whether they include the secretarial or clerical assistance which such meetings normally involve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I understand that those are the total costs of the council, and that they are made up of the travelling and subsistence expenses of the members attending meetings. That is the total identifiable cost of the council. That is all the information that I can give to my hon Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards local authority representation, I can tell the hon Member for Fife, Central that we are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
dealing simply with the total number of local authorities, which has declined considerably as a result of reorganisation. Another major change is that before reorganisation more than one body represented local authorities, and although local authorities may have had a majority of representatives on the council, they were not nominated by one body. Therefore, no one organisation could have had an automatic majority on the council. As a result of reorganisation and the establishment of COSLA as a single organisation representing all local authorities, COSLA has at present the power to nominate the majority of members of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that there is a good argument for local authorities—being the valuation authorities— having major representation on the council, but I think it inappropriate for any one organisation to have an inbuilt majority of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little curious about this line of argument. The Minister has been saying blandly that this is not a question of block votes. Sometimes elected members are not put on the council at all. What is wanted is men with a spread of experience, wisdom, dignity and good sense. Looking at the composition of the council in the past, I can see some justice in that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the present Lord Advocate, for example, was deputy chairman until the election. That suggests that the council was not a waste of his time, or he would not have stayed on it. But if the council is not to be chosen by block votes, what is the reason for the careful tailoring of its composition to reduce the majority of local authority representation? If the composition of the council is so above board, and we are not talking of a point of view being represented, why do we need to adjust the numbers and the local authority element within the numbers in this careful way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: do not claim for a moment that some major reason of national interest or national policy absolutely requires a change of this kind. I do not in any way wish to give it such a level of supreme importance to the strategic objectives of the Government, or of any other body or organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill simply deals with miscellaneous provisions which affect local authorities. It remains the Government's view that it is undesirable for any one body to have an inbuilt majority. I freely accept that it is not the habit of the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council to think or act in terms of block votes. However, the purpose of the council as an advisory body is to represent all valuation interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities do not have the sole interest. There are also the interests of the surveyors, of those who can give professional advice on legal matters and of the general public who, after all, are those most directly affected by questions of valuation. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State feels that it is appropriate to use this opportunity to widen the representation of interests on the Advisory Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem now to be getting a little nearer the truth. Will the Minister tell us how he will obtain
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
representative members of the general public by any means other than popular election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it abundantly clear that few of the members of the present council got there by popular election. Perhaps with the exception of one or two council representatives, the vast majority have been nominated by the Secretary of State or by the convention. The ideal that the one man, one vote principle should apply to membership of the council is as unrealistic or at least as inappropriate as—if not more— the idea that it applies to membership of a Labour Party conference. That is not the point at stake in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon Gentlemen that no decision has been reached on this point as there are no vacancies on the council at present. I do not exclude the possibility that a representative of the ratepayers' interests—whether or not such a change were made—may be considered appropriate by the Secretary of State in the future. A change of this kind would not be necessary to bring that about. The requirements for membership allow for it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the council is not a major matter. I am prepared to reconsider the total size of the council to see whether there should be a further pro rata reduction of all the bodies represented on it. There may be a case for that. However, I do not wish to see any change in the ratio of representation. For example, I believe that the involvement of the local authorities justifies only a large majority—not an overriding majority—on the advisory council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of hon Gentlemen's remarks I shall certainly consider whether the global size of the council needs the numbers proposed. But I see no significant need for further change in the pro rata representation on the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should like to protect the Minister from the charge that if a quango does not cost much there is a good case for increasing its size, which is what the Minister seems to be saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that one of the factors that it is right for the Government to take into account is the cost of a quango, because many of them have substantial costs, and significant savings to the public could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that when the costs are only about £100, and one is satisfied that the organisation is doing a good amount of work in the public interest, that is a very good reason for keeping it. The hon Member for Garscadden referred to the present Lord Advocate, who was a former deputy chairman of the advisory council. It goes without saying that we are interested in his view of the value of the organisation and whether its continued existence would be justified in the public interest. These were among the factors taken into account by the Secretary of State in coming to a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DIMINUTION OF POWERS OF OFFICERS OF COURT AS REGARDS ACTINGS FOR RECOVERY OF RATES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 6, line 6, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"and nothing in the said section 247 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 shall entitle officers of the court to poind, seize, remove or secure property belonging to the spouse of the debtor".</p></blockquote>
The amendment takes us into an area of some controversy and interest to members of the Committee. Its purpose is largely to clarify the existing law. Indeed, the whole clause could be said to be very much on that basis. The clause tries to remove ambiguity and intends to deal with the rather strange phrase that remains in section 247 (2) 	<i>(a)</i> of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947, under which it is possible to
	<br><blockquote><p>"poind, seize, remove or secure property belonging to or in the lawful possession of the debtor".</p></blockquote>
The effect of the clause is to take out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the lawful possession of".</p></blockquote>
It does no more than that. In the clause stand part debate we may want to examine whether the clause ought to be trying to do more and whether it is too timid in its approach.
I shall confine my remarks to the amendment, which also seeks to clarify the situation. It deals with the position of a spouse when goods are poinded following the passing of a decree in an action for recovery of debt. The amendment, which seeks to clarify the phraseology of the 1947 Act, may seem unnecessary because, if the intention of the clause is to ensure that a television set owned by Radio Rentals, say, or a car owned by a finance company cannot be poinded, presumably something owned by a spouse would fall into a similar category. But I am not sure that that is the present position, and I look for some information from the Minister on that point.
I do not pretend to be an expert in the law of diligence. I have found that men who are experts in the law of diligence are usually depressed and alienated creatures living in a private world, and I hope that I am not yet in that category, although a few more months on this Bill may drive me some way into it. With some timidity, I now venture into what I understand the law to be, and I hope that the Minister will help me.
As I understand it, if goods are being poinded in a house, the tenant or owner of the property is deemed to be the owner of the goods. That presumption can be altered only by application to the sheriff. That situation is, in general, justified by expediency. The sheriff's officer arrives and has a duty to make inquiries into the ownership of the goods. Of course, it is difficult to do that satisfactorily. The debtor may plausibly say "That is not mine, but my Auntie Jeannie's" or "That belongs to the local rental firm down the road, and I am getting it in return for a weekly payment." Even if a receipt is produced which shows that the goods were bought by the wife or someone else, it is possible for the officer to be misled, because the goods might have been bought by the person named on the receipt acting as an agent for the debtor. Clearly the law
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
presumes that goods in the house belong to the debtor if that house is owned or tenanted solely by him. That presumption can be lifted only by recourse to the courts at a later stage.
The position becomes more complicated, as the Minister will agree, because Scottish law sometimes falls behind changing social customs. The number of joint tenancies has substantially increased and will continue to do so because local authorities are becoming more conscious of the wife's position, particularly as regards her removal from a house on the break-up of a marriage. I think that there may be increasing pressure to think in terms of joint tenancies to protect the wife's position. We may deal with women's rights in the matrimonial home elsewhere, perhaps in the Bill on family violence. In any event, joint tenancies may become a more common feature on the local authority scene. More and more married couples now insist or decide—insist suggests an element of strife—that the title of the matrimonial home should be in joint names. That complicates the presumption which I spoke about.
As I understand the present law, if there is a joint tenancy or title, there is a presumption that the household goods are in joint ownership. Since goods in joint ownership cannot be poinded, the matter will become increasingly complicated as the trend becomes more pronounced. The old presumption, which is based upon sole tenancy or on single ownership by the debtor, becomes less of a prop on which to rely if— it is a big "if", and no doubt we shall discuss the matter on clause stand part—it is assumed that the present system should survive largely unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to show the difficulty which surrounds a spouse, and the goods owned by a spouse, when poinding takes place. In Scotland there has never been a well-developed law on matrimonial property. Indeed, any practising solicitor, advising on the unfortunate circumstances of a marriage break-up, has a little ritual piece which explains that almost everything is owned by someone. It has either been bought by one of the parties or there was an intention on the donor's part when the object was gifted; it was given to the husband or the wife and on that ownership ultimately will rest. It becomes a somewhat artificial concept when we speak about Auntie Jeannie who presented the gift to the happy couple on the occasion of their wedding; presumably it is then jointly owned and the apportionment under the law becomes something of a lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, such presumptions are unsatisfactory as a basis for future operation. Even leaving aside the wider considerations of the general reform of warrant sales procedure, their social significance and social justification, the Government's attempt—which in general I support—to remove from the 1947 Act the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the lawful possession of"</p></blockquote>
still leaves the question of the spouse's position, or goods owned by the spouse, very much in the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have glanced at Memorandum No. 48 produced by the Scottish Law Commission—the Second Memorandum on Diligence, Poinding and Warrant Sales— which deals at some length with this matter. The Minister will recall that among the options considered was whether we should go down the line with Northern
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
Ireland on this point. In Northern Ireland in 1965 we had the Anderson report. As warrant sales are of current interest and some controversy, no doubt the Minister, being in charge of law reform, will be familiar with this run of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the Anderson report, it was suggested that when the equivalent of a sheriff officer—I do not know the technicalities of the Irish system—seized goods to meet a debt requirement, he might seize a spouse's goods, even if they were owned by that spouse, if the debt being met from the proceeds was incurred for the family's benefit or, in the context of our deliberations, if it was in connection with the rent of the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we should go down that road, because it involves a value judgment by the officer of the court, or whoever will carry out the process. He must decide—I would not like to be in his position—whether the debt was incurred for the benefit or enjoyment of the family. It is perhaps clearer in the second category; if the local district council is trying to obtain rent arrears, it would clearly fall under the Anderson concept. But I do not wish to make a value judgment in this matter. I do not, therefore, favour going along the Northern Ireland line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission discussion document—I stress that Memorandum No. 48 is a matter for discussion; the Law Commission has not come to firm conclusions —puts up suggestions that are probably not a bad guideline for what the Law Commission intends ultimately to do about the matter. It proposes that, in homes that are in joint ownership or joint tenancy, there should be a presumption that one can poind all the household goods and that it would be up to the wife later to have recourse to the courts to rebut that presumption and to rescue her goods from the maw of the creditor or the creditor's agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that that proposal has a certain attraction, on the assumption that it is workable. It would allow the poinding to go ahead smoothly and would allow the sheriff officer more or less to poind any household goods owned by either husband or wife and leave the courts to sort the matter out. My objection is that, very often, he would end up poinding goods that belonged to the spouse—perhaps even to a separated spouse, who knows?—and, in the course of human nature, the idea that the other spouse would get a solicitor, go to the courts, rebut the presumption and unpoind the goods belonging to her that had been poinded for her husband's debt is a theoretical concept which people like we in the legal profession imagine happens but which does not often happen. At the end of the day, goods that should not be poinded would be poinded and, what is more, if it went as far as a warrant sale—which I agree is comparatively rare—might ultimately lead to injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may even be a moral case—I put it no higher— for that presumption of joint ownership based upon the indivisibility of a marriage, but many of us were forced some time ago to depart from that idea in terms of social reality and social policy building. I am, therefore, not happy about the recommendation in the discussion document. It was to ventilate the issue and perhaps to draw the Minister that the amendment was tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the clause is not concerned with the whole range of warrant sales. It is concerned with
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
warrant sales made for one specific and limited purpose —the recovery of rates. But the principles are the same. The decisions we reach on the clause in that context will influence and perhaps even pre-empt what may happen on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the amendment is simply to put the wife on an equal footing with her husband. It seeks to prevent an assumption that her goods are her husband's goods and that a debt against the husband can be enforced against her. It is an attempt to recognise that the wife is a separate entity, legally, morally, physically and in every sense and that, if a debt arises against one spouse, it should not be automatically enforceable and there should be no presumption that it can be recovered at the expense of the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair, that is not quite what the Law Commission document presupposes. Its presumption is that the goods are the husband's when in fact they may not be. One could work on that presumption and leave it to subsequent legal action to sort out, but it may be better to state the matter simply in the terms that, when we are exempting from poinding, seizing, removing or securing
	<br><blockquote><p>"property … in the lawful possession of the debtor"</p></blockquote>
on the grounds that that should give no excuse for detaining a third party's property, we should take the same general attitude to the property of a spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that gets us into practical difficulty about how the sheriff officer establishes or knows that he must accept what is said to him. But the same argument arises with rented goods, hire purchase goods or anything of that kind. If we accept that the sheriff officer can see his way around that imbroglio—as there are very few houses that do not have even a television set on hire purchase—and if we can surmount the practical difficulties in such a case, I would have thought it possible to meet the practical difficulties of saying that there should be no poinding of a spouse's effects to meet the liabilities, obligations and debts of his or her married partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are complicated matters. The Minister may take the view that this is the wrong vehicle in which to consider them. That is always a convenient way out of an argument, but I hope that he will not take it. The massive tomes in front of me, the Law Commission memorandums, which landed on our desks last October, are open for discussion until, I believe, the end of March. It would be a convenient argument for the Minister merely to say " We are waiting for the flood of representations to come in, and do not wish at this point to take any decisions in the matter." That might be an argument on the general attitude to warrant sales, which may crop up under stand part, or warrant sales in connection with the recovery of rates, although I still think that it would be enormously valuable to draw the Minister on the matter and perhaps to allow the Opposition to express views which could be part of the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that on the general point we have here a small tidying-up clause which was introduced by the Minister of his own volition. If he is making the minor amendments here by removing this ambiguity, by removing the words
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the lawful possession of",</p></blockquote>
and if we are to start making that kind of minor reform—there is never a bad time for law reform and clarifi-

cation of statute, as it is obscure enough, and many of us could suggest how it could be improved—in regard to section 247 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947, it is an opportunity to go that little bit further and consider whether we should not clarify the position of a spouse. I am convinced that that needs clarification on the basis of what the Law Commission has said, and on my general impressions of how the system has been working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have at least set out the problem and what we are driving at. I await with interest the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was surprised to see the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) trying to catch your eye, Mr. Gourlay. It is somewhat unusual for two Opposition Front Bench spokesmen to seek to speak one after the other. It is a curious principle and not one, I hope, that will be a feature of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall not have a general debate on the subject of warrant sales, not because it is an unimportant subject, but because it does not arise out of the limited change which is all that the clause provides in regard to local government rate collection. I appreciate that this is a matter that hon Members on both sides of the Committee are interested in, and no doubt there will be plenty of opportunities to debate the subject. There are many opportunities for hon Members, through Adjournment debates, Consolidated Fund Bill debates, and debates in the Grand Committee debate if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major debate on warrant sales does not arise out of this improvement of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, such a debate would be a fruitless exercise, because the Scottish Law Commission will make major recommendations in the near future. The Government will not indicate, in advance of the Law Commission's recommendations, their view on the matter. We have already indicated in response to inquiries that we recognise that there is substantial public concern about the need to reform the law on warrant sales, that we anxiously await the recommendations of the Law Commission and that, when the Law Commission does recommend, we shall look very urgently and closely at its proposals.

	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's concern. It is simply a question of judgment whether a
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
local government miscellaneous provisions Bill is an appropriate time to deal with the matter. One could raise it in a debate on the Queen's Speech, or on all sorts of issues, but one would have to consider whether that was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a detailed proposal in the Bill, as is the amendment, which the hon Member for Garscadden will be glad to know is unnecessary. A spouse by definition is a third party. If the spouse is not the owner of the property, clearly it would be wrong for his or her property to be poinded in the satisfaction of a rates payment which arose out of it. I can assure the hon Gentleman that without his amendment his objective would still be ensured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can comment, therefore, on the purpose of the clause. It proposes a change which I am sure will be warmly welcomed by both sides of the Committee, including, I hope, by the hon Member for Fife, Central. It is an indication of the Government's recognition of the need for improvement in this aspect of the law. At present a sheriff officer enforcing a summary warrant for a recovery of rates may enter the rate debtor's premises and poind any goods or effects in these premises which belong to the debtor or are in his lawful possession, irrespective of whether he owns them or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to poind property in the rates debtor's lawful possession, even though it belongs to a third party, is potentially unfair. Even though the law provides remedies to the third party, it is unreasonable that he should have to go to the trouble and expense of taking steps to secure his rights when he is in no way responsible for the original rates debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter was raised by a number of hon Gentlemen including my hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) as a result of a case involving a caravan site in the North-East of Scotland. But there has also been a number of other expressions of concern about this matter. The Government thought, therefore, that it was useful to use this opportunity to deal with a clear anomaly in the law and to seek to reform it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there is no prospect within the Bill of dealing with the general subject of warrant sales. But I repeat that we recognise the substantial public concern on this matter. There is to be an early series of recommendations from the Scottish Law Commission, and we shall give urgent consideration to its recommendations when they are forthcoming. It would be inappropriate to go beyond that. Although I am well aware of hon Gentlemen's concern and their undoubted desire to use every opportunity to express it, it will not help us deal with the issues raised by the Bill, which is all that we are concerned with, if we use this opportunity to have a lengthy debate on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept the Minister's reluctance to commit himself in advance of the recommendations from the Law Commission. But the Opposition feel that an opportunity has been lost here. It would be possible in the Bill to make a modest attempt to reform what is probably one of the most unsavoury aspects of Scottish society—namely, warrant sales—and to prevent local authorities from using the warrant sale as a means of providing the necessary funds to pay off rent and rates. I use rent and rates arrears, because in many instances the two are combined. To judge from the kind of people who get into these difficulties and from a cursory reading of the newspapers, rent and rates are combined in most instances, although not all. However, the clause concerns rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has missed an opportunity which would in no way prejudice the likely findings or recommendations of the Law Commission. This is a rather modest reform in what could almost be called the Radio Rentals clause, in the sense that very few households, as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, do not have some form of rented consumer durable. More likely than not it is a television set. In some instances items such as washing machines can be obtained by this means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister is a reasonable man in these matters and is concerned to remove from Scotland one of the most embarrassing and unsavoury aspects of the law. The way in which money is raised from people in dire financial straits is a relic of almost Dickensian offensiveness. Allowing for the fact that those who get into financial difficulties have access to social security and the fact that rates are deducted on a monthly basis, I imagine that the number of instances is relatively small. Therefore, if we are ignoring the opportunity for a modest reform and only a small number of people are involved, it is an even bigger condemnation of the Government's failure to take advantage of this opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister provide us with information on the number of cases in which the local authorities take advantage of warrant sales to recover rates? Is he concerned, as we are, that, with the increase in unemployment likely to be announced today and the continuing increases in the months ahead, with these appalling figures, the trail of social waste that they will leave behind and the difficulties that people will encounter, the problem could get bigger? If it does, it is incumbent upon the Government, since to a large extent they created the unemployment, to seek to minimise its worst effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeing now not only council tenants being made unemployed, but the whole range of society becoming affected by this difficulty. We are talking not just about those who have rents and rates and certain arrangements which can be arrived at quickly and speedily by social workers in conjunction with housing departments to get Department of Health and Social Security intervention. We are talking about people who hitherto have never had any dealings with social agencies of this kind, where mistakes can happen and where difficulties will arise very quickly in regard to rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the number of cases hitherto was
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
fairly modest—we shall have confirmation of that from the Minister—but in the months ahead it will become an ever-increasing problem for many people. We are concerned that the Government and the Minister are missing an opportunity to help to solve one of the many problems caused by unemployment and a sharp drop in living standards. Any modest attempt by the Government to alleviate these problems should be dealt with as speedily as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not oppose this provision in the clause, because we are very happy that the Minister has taken cognisance—to use a good trade union expression—of the changing circumstances of lawful possession. Far more people are in the anomalous position of having goods in lawful possession but not being the owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Minister is not going far enough, and that he is losing an opportunity. I think that all of us are conscious of the great public interest in this matter. To some extent that is attributable to the activities of the 	<i>Sunday Mail,</i> which has been relentless in its expose of the worst effects. Only last Sunday it published an expression of support from no less a body than the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society—the lawyers' trade union—is not regarded as one of the ones which wield the block vote progressively in the interests of working people. Perhaps it is a body in its death throes. For all we know, Clive Jenkins is busy recruiting and has to conduct a PR exercise among the readers of the 	<i>Sunday Mail.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not withstanding that, the Law Society has come out in support of the 	<i>Sunday Mail</i> and has said that the newspaper is carrying out a worthwhile campaign. When such campaigns are given support by such eminently conservative bodies as the Law Society it is up to the Minister to take note and realise that the flow of events may well be overtaking him and that an opportunity has been missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking the Minister to abolish warrant sales at this stage, because we know that that would be inappropriate, although desirable. We are not asking him to anticipate the recommendations of the commission We know that during this parliamentary Session there may well be opportunities to change this, and if the recommendations emerge in an acceptable form we will be happy to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we feel that, in the interests of local government, local authorities should be given some encouragement. Many local authorities at present are not using the warrant sale as a means of recovering rates. Some local authorities are not as progressive as those which chose to eschew this method. We believe that that should be handled by giving them the right to use the warrant sale and for that right to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. HUGH MCCARTNEY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can. There is a working consensus that warrant sales are the most unsatisfactory means of recovering debt, and that some local authorities have ceased to use the method for rate purposes. As the Minister is using the Bill as an opportunity to tidy up one part of it, I am suggesting that he can go that bit further in one area of our national life— local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that to be inconsistent. I know that there are a multitude of problems when dealing with the rights of private individuals and trying to recover debt. But there is an increasing sense of revulsion in the country against warrant sales. More local authorities are now choosing not to use this system. As we are considering a local government miscellaneous provisions Bill, I consider it appropriate for the Minister to ask COSLA for its views and, after those consultations, to deal with the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot simply wash his hands of the whole question of warrant sales. I think that all of us in the Committee are agreed that they are offensive both in the way they operate and in their effects on the individuals concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter was discussed with COSLA. The convention was concerned about the very limited proposal in the clause. One or two representatives from the convention said that they were concerned that this would limit local authorities' power to recover rates due to them. However, they accepted that, on balance, it would be desirable to have a change of this kind.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there are many people within the convention.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am talking about—to reply to the Minister's intervention from a sedentary position— is that the major local authorities in Scotland which are confronted with such problems are eschewing that as a means of recovering rates. The Minister is losing an opportunity here. He need not hide behind the Law Commission. He has an opportunity in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take our time over the Bill, as I hope we shall, because there are many important considerations which go right to the core of local government democracy in Scotland, perhaps our considerations will stretch into April or May. It would be appropriate for the Minister to give us an undertaking now that if the Law Commission's recommendations favour removing the rights of local authorities to conduct warrant sales, he will take advantage of that and bring in a clause as soon as possible. The Opposition suggest that that should be done either on Third Reading or when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
Bill is discussed in another place. We would not oppose such a clause: Indeed, I imagine that we would support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will not oppose clause 11. We see it as a recognition of a change in circumstances. We are happy that the Government have seen fit to improve matters to this limited extent. But we feel that the Minister is missing an "opportunity to remove from Scottish society and from local authorities what is simply an exercise in Dickensian tyranny over a number of people who already have enough problems. That number will continue to increase as long as the Government's inept economic policies continue to take the toll that they have taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such is the concern of Conservative Members that when the figures are announced on the third Tuesday of every month—today is appropriate because the unemployment figures will be announced later—they are met with complacency. There is no talk from Conservative Members of the likelihood of unemployment figures falling. They are frightened to death to try to project them because they know the consequences. But as the figures get worse, more and more people will be vulnerable to such tyranny from local authorities. The Opposition say that those authorities which are sufficiently backward in their attitudes and sufficiently regressive in their approach to social problems should have taken from them what we regard as a disgraceful right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not oppose the clause but we feel that the Minister is not taking the chance available to him to introduce a modest reform. Such a reform would help many people who are now in considerable difficulty as well as those who will be getting into difficulty in the coming months, and who could fall prey to the powers which the Opposition think that local authorities should be deprived of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Mr. Gourlay was in the Chair, Mr. McCartney, I misunderstood the burden of what he was saying. I was proposing to speak in the clause stand part debate, but I gather that, in effect, this is just that kind of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sorry that the Minister sought to curb the debate on the ground that he could not say anything helpful if we widened our discussion because it was all said in the clause and we were awaiting the recommendations of the Law Commission. We understand that, but one of the advantages of a miscellaneous provisions Bill is that it enables the Opposition to ventilate their views on problems which exercise their minds and, we believe, the minds of our electors. Albeit we shall not solve anything in this debate, as the Minister says, it is not wasting time for us to express our views on a problem which is causing and has caused great concern over a number of years. It is not as simple a problem to resolve as some hon Members pretend. That is precisely why successive Governments have lived with it. There are balances to be struck in this matter, and it is always difficult to find the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the Minister has read the successive elements of publicity that have been given to this matter by the 	<i>Sunday Mail</i> and other newspapers for a number of years. The present practice is a sordid, uncivilised, tyrannical way of dealing with a problem which undoubtedly will increase. With escalating un

	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
employment in Scotland and elsewhere and, no doubt, escalating rates as a direct consequence of the Government's policy, many more people will face the greatly increased problem of paying those rates. It is gratifying to see that the Bill recognises that fact and seeks to give protection—albeit limited—from this vicious exercise of poinding, which is abhorrent to anyone who has seen it in action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be hearing from me of a recent case in Glenrothes. It concerns not rates, but a man who is separated from his wife. He got into debt as a result, I think, of maintenance payments, but, no matter what the debt, he received an order and the sheriff's men came to his house. Although he told them that the property was not his, they nevertheless took it. Subsequently his lawyer proved by written evidence that the property was not his client's. Even so, that man is now landed, as an innocent party to this viciousness, with legal costs and everything else on top of his debt burden, which is exacerbated by this vicious uncivilised practice. I make no apology for exercising our right to put on record the Opposition's abhorrence of this practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>By seeking to modify the practice on rate debt, the Minister himself conceding that he is dissatisfied and uncomfortable with the continuing practice of poinding and warrant sales. It might serve a useful purpose, it might give hope to people in Scotland, if he could give us an estimate now of his timetable in the matter. A lot depends on the Law Commission, but he can give it a gentle nudge and say that Members of Parliament on all sides are deeply concerned to have this matter remedied as soon as possible. He can request them to continue with their recommendations with a sense of urgency. The Government have said that they do not have a heavy legislative programme. I do not think that the Government will last that much longer, so they should perhaps take the opportunity to mend their fences in Scotland. The Government will be virtually eliminated in Scotland but it might save half a dozen parliamentary seats if they get on and resolve this problem in the next 12 or 18 months, because that is the probable limit of their tenure of office. The Minister has a great opportunity to salvage something from the wreck of the Scottish Tory Party that is now imminent.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
fied by the Bill. As a result of the provision, it will not be possible to poind property not owned by the debtor. That already cannot happen for other forms of debt. As the law stands, property not owned by the debtor, but in his lawful possession, can only be poinded as the result of a rates debt. For other forms of debt poinding may occasionally happen, but those implementing it have no legal right to do so. The hon Gentleman can reassure his constituent about that. The clause seeks to place rates debts in the same position as other debts so that only property owned by the debtor can be poinded in satisfaction of the debt.

It would not be right for me to put pressure on the Law Commission. It has the matter in hand at the moment and is well aware of the public concern. I do not know whether its members regularly read the 	<i>Sunday Mail,</i> but the Law Commission's memorandum on the subject recognises that the matter is of great public interest. The Law Commission will make its recommendations to the Government in due course and we intend to examine those very quickly to see whether they are acceptable and how we should deal with them. That is all the information I can give the Committee at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since you are treating this as a stand part debate, Mr. Gourlay, I shall make a few points to the Minister before we move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I agree with those of my hon Friends who have said that the Minister could, and probably should, have gone further in respect of warrant sales. He could have set a precedent by taking away local authorities' powers to conduct warrant sales to collect rates arrears. If that precedent had been set, it would have been easier for us to remove that obnoxious power in other areas. We would have been able to remove a particularly sordid blemish from the Scottish legal picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is described as the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Diminution of powers of officers of court as regards actings for recovery of rates."</p></blockquote>
My hon Friends were probably right to concentrate on warrant sales, but I refer to some of the other powers mentioned in the clause. Besides poinding, officers of the court have the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"seize, remove or secure property belonging to … the debtor".</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if the Minister said something about those further powers because I do not feel that the clause greatly reduces the powers of officers of the court. It means only that it will no longer be possible to hold a warrant sale of something in the lawful possession of the debtor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure whether the hon Gentleman was in the Committee when I spoke earlier, but I pointed out that the purpose of the clause was to put the rights of the sheriff's officer over rates debts on the same footing as other debts. At present, the distinction is that in the case of rates debts property can be seized whether it is owned by the debtor or merely in his possession. The objective of the clause is to put such a debt in no better or worse position than other forms of debt. In our view it would be improper to go further for one type of debt at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly helpful, although some of us should have liked the Minister to go further at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us about the powers of seizure and the power to remove or to secure property which apparently exist? It is all very well to say that such draconian powers are not often used, but they are on the statute book. There are some individuals in backwoods local authorities who would be happy to take advantage of these powers to secure someone's house and prevent a family and children getting into their home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we finish dealing with the clause, will the Minister tell the Committee how much these powers are used at present, and what view he would take if extensive use were made of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that would cause the debate to go wider than the clause before the Committee and therefore the Minister could not reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there is to be a short adjournment while the personal physician of the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is summoned, I should not object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise, Mr. Gourlay, merely because earlier I spoke narrowly on the amendment. I had not realised that this was a clause stand part debate. I should like now to raise one or two matters on clause stand part. The Minister will no doubt despatch them quickly, but I think that they are worth an airing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amendment was unnecessary. I took him to mean that a spouse will be treated in terms of this provision in the 1947 Act in the same way as any other third party. I am grateful for that information. There is considerable discussion in the Law Commission's memorandums about the position of a spouse, which suggests that there is doubt and debate of the type to which I referred earlier. After the passing of clause 11 in its present form, will the law in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 be exactly the same as the law generally in regard to the warrant sales procedure for the recovery of debt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister understands my point. If his answer is in the affirmative, a lot of the speculation in the Law Commission report must in his view be redundant, and a spouse, being on all fours with any other third party who may have goods in the home of the debtor where the poinding has been carried out, will be protected. If that is the case, it is puzzling that we should have had all this worry, talk and anxiety about the presumption that everything in the household is owned by the householder or sole tenant, who, if he is the debtor, is available for poinding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is still somewhat obscure, but perhaps it is only my somewhat slow start to the morning that
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
makes it difficult to grasp. If the Minister will answer that specific question, we shall have advanced to some degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general clause stand part points, I accept that the Minister could not be expected to make any sort of general announcement about the future of the warrant sales system under the guise of this clause. I am not clear why, historically, we have these provisions for the recovery of rates by the normal methods of diligence. Is there any point in their continuance? Is there some particularity in the 1947 Act which gives a local authority for the recovery of rates powers which would not be available for recovering rent arrears? Presumably, if there is not, the whole separate status of rates recovery becomes largely redundant. If there is a special distinction, perhaps it would be useful if the Minister explained it to us so that, before we gave the clause a fair wind on to the statute book, we could evaluate its worth and the purpose behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a little strange that we have a general system —or write a system—that has been open to a great deal of criticism in years gone by. But at least it is a system which covers almost all other forms of civil debt recovery. Suddenly we have this specific 1947 Act compound which allows us to deal with the recovery of rates alone as distinct from rents or civil debt generally. It is a little bit of a curiosity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with my hon Friends, who have said that this is rather a timid piece of reform and that clause 11 is tinkering with the system—squeaking round the edges, one might say—rather than attacking some of the self-evident abuse. But I accept that if Ministers have been waiting for 10 years for the Law Commission report on diligence at least we now seem to be on the verge of seeing an end to this lengthy gestation period. I think that we have now had seven working papers on the subject since October, and they are all substantial and full of interesting speculation and information. If I remember rightly, eight reports have been commissioned on official aspects of the warrant sale procedure. Therefore, clearly we must wait a little longer—I hope that it will be for only a short time— for some sort of considered judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the point raised by my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire that it would be useful to have some indication of the number of sales under section 247 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947. I have not been able to find that information. Indeed, I have had the gravest difficulty in discovering the position on warrant sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that on page 22 of the first memorandum on diligence, memorandum No. 47, there is an extremely useful table which deals with the year 1978. It reveals that in that year there were 126,171 decrees in civil debt actions, which resulted in 46,000 charges, 20,000 poindings, 6,200 warrants of sale, 3,000 advertisements of sale and ultimately 300 sales. Therefore, in the jargon of the Law Commission's long journey through the intricacies of diligence procedure there is a funnel or filter effect, and 126,000 decrees end up as just under 300 actual warrant sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to argue—I am sure that the Minister would not make this mistake—that warrant sale procedures are in themselves unimportant. The fact that few take place does not mean that there is not a great deal of misery, humiliation and distress on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
road. It is perhaps no great credit to my trade to say that an enormous amount of expense is also incurred. As one poinds, charges and advertises, one has to advise, consult and administer. All that costs money. Therefore, we have the ludicrous situation that one can often end up with expenses which outrun the debt being recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it ought to be said in fairness that the courts have recently, as the Minister will be aware, taken a somewhat more enlightened view. There have been judgments such as SSEB v. Carlyle, which the Committee will find in 1980 Scots Law Times, Sheriff Court Reports at page 98. There the court refused to grant a warrant for a sale on the ground that the expenses would be more than the proceeds of the poinding. That seems an extremely sensible attitude, which I hope the courts will follow in the months ahead while we wait final reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried about the figure of warrant sales. It is probably under 300. We are looking for the subdivision on rate recovery, but I have had a note—which I have not had time to consult—from the Library, whose staff are extremely helpful about these matters, telling me that published figures for warrant sales are available only for 1977 and 1978. They are: 1977,4,853; 1978, 4,995. Those figures are from the civil judicial statistics for 1978, and I think they must be the English figures. On a pro rata basis that would be about reasonable and would square with a Scottish figure of just under 300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, another reference that I have here suggests that, in 1975, the figure was 223 and, in 1976,222. But it goes on to say that, in 1978, it was 172.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, therefore, I am satisfied in general that the figure is under 300,1 am not entirely clear about the authoritative figure as I have had conflicting advice. I have no doubt, however, that the Minister can quickly give us the absolute figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not labour the point, but the whole business of warrant sales, as at present adminstered, is thoroughly objectionable. It is a complicated, labyrinthine process which is almost entirely under the control of the creditor. If, for example, someone turns up to poind, one has a right to go to the courts for damages, but one has to prove that the poinding was carried out with malice and want of probable cause. That is a redress that will never be used; it is too complicated and difficult. The standard that would have to be discharged is far too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that process, one gets a decree and does not even have to go back to the courts until one wishes to hold the sale. By that time, the expenses will have built up and one will have gone through hoops and over hurdles which the debtor cannot influence and which may cost him a great deal of money. The process is, I suppose, an effective threat to concentrate the mind and hence has the filter effect to which I referred. But it is undignified and unpleasant and much in need of reform. I believe that that is common ground in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I enter a word of caution. Not everyone is unanimous in the view that warrant sales can be abolished or that we can do without the procedure. The blood pressure of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) will probably suffer if he reads through the Law Commission memorandum and finds that the process is described there as a relatively
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
efficient and cost-effective method of recovering debt. The commission's recommendation is that the process should survive and that we cannot do without it. There are persuasive practical arguments in its favour such as "What shall we put in its place?" For instance, if someone owes money, and he is the cunning type of gentleman whose assets are all tangible—goods and property—it is annoying if he says " I cannot pay your £500 bill. I have nothing in the bank and no money that you can arrest," and yet he is sitting surrounded by a veritable Aladdin's cave of property. If there is no equivalent to the warrant sale procedure, nothing can be done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see that simple argument. I speak with caution, because there is a body of opinion that says that we cannot do without the procedure. When we come to our final recommendation, those are matters that we shall have to look at carefully. I suspect, however, that such arguments were produced in 1880 when we abolished civil imprisonment for debt, although we have since done very well without it. I am not convinced that we cannot get round those arguments about the need for a sanction in the form of warrant sales. The argument is analogous to some matter that I raised on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, when I suggested that we did not need the sanction of imprisonment for the non-payment of small fines. I had some sympathy but not much practical help or support from the Minister and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise the difficulties of finding a sanction for non-payment of debt, I believe that the final balance is in favour of radical reform—probably much more radical than appears to be in the Law Commission's mind at present. It suggests useful measures, such as the right to go to the courts and say that the valuation of goods poinded is too low— which seems to me a sensible and essential reform— and that sales should take place at public auctions, as a protection against the situation where a valuable property sells at a knock-down price. I accept that these matters will have to be considered at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to the earlier point. What is the validity of this separate machinery? Is it separate in any real sense in terms of valid distinction, in terms of different procedure or different end product for the recovery of rates as against everything else? Also, will the Minister at least make some sign of encouragement—he may not wish to legislate to those local authorities which have taken the line that warrant sales should not be used for the recovery of rates or for the recovery of rent arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in regard to rent and rates, this perhaps answers the Minister's point about our not having a general debate and that therefore we cannot pre-empt that general debate by making any more fundamental change in this clause because it would be seen as setting a general pattern for the warrant sales and diligence system. There is a distinction to be drawn, because it is especially the debts which refer to the roof over one's head, to the home in which one lives, that can mean a special category, and the fact that we have this special machinery for the recovery of rates underlines that they come within a special category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be no bad thing, in not pre-empting the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
general debate we cannot hold, if the Minister considered the possibility of giving at least some moral encouragement, some word or commendation for local authorities that take the view, or are debating at the moment, a policy decision that there should be no use of poinding and, ultimately, warrant sales, for the recovery of rent and rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of the details, but I understand that Glasgow is one such local authority, and that the matter will be in committee very soon. I am sure that the local authorities are not alone in taking what is, on the whole, a sensible attitude. I appreciate that rate and rent arrears are a great problem, but in the way in which one ends up with evictions by creating problems which ultimately have to be solved under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, the use of warrant sales to recover rates or rents will probably, at the end of the day, create more problems than it solves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be drawn just half an inch from beyond his cautious barricade, to tell us not what he will do to remodel the whole system of diligence in Scotland, but that in this one corner the Government support those who say that this archaic, unnecessary, socially divisive, process needs radical reform—if not total abolition—and should be removed from the area of debts incurred specifically in the provision of housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman asked earlier for an assurance that the position as regards spouses would as a result of the clause be, in future, the same in regard to rates debts as other debts. I am able to give him that assurance. The hon Gentleman also asked for an indication as to the overall Scottish figures for the use of procedures of this sort in the collection of rates debts. We do not have any figures for the Scottish Office, and it obviously depends on the decisions of individual local authorities as to how often they use those powers. I am sure that individual local authorities could respond to any inquiries as to their own use of the powers, but I cannot give the Committee the global figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman also asked for the historical origin of the slightly wider powers for local authorities compared with other persons to whom debts are due. He will be aware, and this answers a point raised by the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), that these provisions arose as a result of the 1947 Act—the Act of a progressive Government—which provided for seizure and various other powerful means of ensuring that debts were repaid. However, it appears to have been the view of the Government at that time, and of successive Governments, that some wider powers were justified because the community as a whole suffers as a consequence of the non-payment of rates. I am not sure whether such an argument would be considered valid today, but that appears to be the historical background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman's final request to me was that, although we cannot legislate at this stage, I should give some encouragement to those local authorities which are not using this method. I do not think that that would be appropriate, as it would be to prejudge the Law Commission's recommendations. Whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
system local authorities use, we hope that they will use their statutory powers in a humanitarian way, consistent with both common sense and decency. I have no doubt that the vast majority of local authorities wish to do so. Nevertheless, it would be inappropriate for me to go beyond that in advance of the Law Commission's recommendations on a subject which, as the hon Gentleman conceded, is very difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to admire your voice signals, Mr. Gourlay, which come across loud and clear. I promise that I shall not delay the Committee too long on clause 12. I shall raise only a small point, which is almost one of curiosity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 is short and succinct. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sections 4 to 9 of this Act have no effect as regards any financial year earlier than that immediately subsequent to the financial year in which this Act is passed."</p></blockquote>
I think that all of us can at least understand that plain English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 33, headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Short title, commencement and extent",</p></blockquote>
subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sections 4 to 9 of this Act"—</p></blockquote>
the sections referred to in clause 12, which we are debating—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, in so far as relating to section 6(7) of the 1956 Act or section 4(2) of the Local Government (Financial Provisions etc.) (Scotland) Act 1962, Schedule 4 to this Act shall come into force on 1st April 1982."</p></blockquote>
Clause 12 seems to provide that sections 4 to 9 will have no effect until the financial year subsequent to that in which the Act is passed. But clause 33 seems to provide that the same sections will come into force on 1 April 1982. I am not clear about why we need both provisions, as one of them seems redundant. Will the Minister explain the matter to me? We can then take it further, if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The explanation is that although clause 33 states that the provisions will come into effect on 1 April 1982, the possibility is not excluded that some of the effects of these provisions could then be retro-

	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
spective. The purpose of clause 12 is to ensure that sections 4 to 9 of the Act will
	<br><blockquote><p>"have no effect as regards any financial year earlier than that immediately subsequent to the financial year in which this Act is passed."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, without clause 12, although sections 4 to 9 would come into effect on 1 April 1982, it might have been argued that their effect in certain respects could influence decisions about financial years that have not yet arisen because they deal with matters which might be raised on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to be difficult. I am labouring a little in the rear at the moment. It might be easier for me if the Minister would explain how that retrospective argument could be used, and give an example of how it could happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give an immediate example, although it may be subject to further clarification if I prove to be wrong. Clause 5, for example, deals with the relaxation of provisions relating to charitable organisations. When we discussed it, 1 said that one of its effects would be to enable a charity to claim rate relief not only for the year in question but for the preceding financial year. Clearly, if we allowed that to have effect for last year it would disrupt decisions that have already been taken by local authorities, which would not have known of the incidence of this provision. In other words, we are trying to ensure that no local authority will be at a disadvantage as a result of its past decisions taken in ignorance of the improvements in the law now being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not present when clause 5 was debated, so perhaps I should look at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that these provisions come into force on 1 April 1982. That presumably means that they will come into effect at the beginning of the next financial year—after the passing of the Act, in any event. This Bill will reach the statute book some time in the financial year 1981-82 and, if the provisions are to have no effect until 1 April 1982 it seems to me that exactly the same thing is being said as has been said in clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is incorrect. Clause 33 states that these provisions shall come into effect on 1 April 1982. Clause 	<i>5(b)(a)</i> defines "relevant period" as
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a case where the occupation and use, or as the case .may be the holding, commenced on or after the first day of the financial year immediately preceding the financial year in which the notice is given, any period after that commencement".</p></blockquote>
That sort of provision would, in normal circumstances, once it had been in operation for some time, enable a charity to claim relief for a financial year that had already concluded. If we were to say, without clause 12, that clause 33 would be the sole clause concerning commencement proceedings, that would enable decisions that were taken for the current year to be affected by the provisions of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this is complicated matter. What we are in essence seeking to do is to ensure that these clauses are not retrospective in their effect—simply that. Without clause 12, it is feared that they would be retrospective, and that would be unfair to local authorities which had been given no prior warning of these
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
likely proposals in the years in question, so for their protection this would seem desirable. It would also lead to reopening many decisions, which could lead to administrative confusion unlikely to be in anyone's interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all against retrospective legislation, as we are all against sin—we occasionally practise it, no doubt, but we all deplore it.

Since the clause was drafted we have considered that operating 'by reference to gross estimated expenditure would lead to practical administrative difficulties for local authorities and others concerned with its implementation. Therefore, it is desired to base the Secretary of State's consideration not on gross but on net estimated expenditure, arrived at by deducting from the estimated expenses the income received by a local authority from sources other than rates and Government grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning is that net expenditure corresponds closely to relevant expenditure for rate support grant purposes and is more readily ascertainable both by local authorities and by the Secretary of State. The amendments give effect to that purpose. They leave the main body of the clause unaffected, apart from the minor consequential renumbering afforded by amendments Nos. 40-43. The substantive amendment is No. 44. It will enable the Secretary of State, in determining whether an authority's estimated expenses are excessive and unreasonable, to leave out of account those categories to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that here I can be of distinct assistance to the Committee so that hon Members may more fully appreciate the reasoning behind these technical amendments. The categories of expenditure which would be left out of account for 1981-82 are, in broad terms: first, expenses met from income other than from rates and grants—fees paid to local authorities for various services are obviously income other than from rates and grants; secondly by loan charges incurred by a local authority on capital expenditure; thirdly, certain capital expenses; and, fourthly, expenses relating to housing. The Committee will be aware that housing expenditure does not form part of the rate support grant settlement. It is concerned with the (housing support grant settlement, and the Secretary of State's view for the forthcoming year of 1981-82 is that it would be inappropriate to include such part of a local authority's housing expenditure which is not directly related to the rate support grant settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended to publish those categories of exclusions. Therefore, the areas of expenditure which would be reviewed in connection with the powers being sought in the Bill will be made known to local authorities by circular before their budgets for the forthcoming year have been finally determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to clause 14 are of a similar technical purpose. I hope that the Committee will agree that they will materially improve the provisions and will simplify the exchanges that may flow from any use of these powers and, therefore, will be to the benefit both of local authorities and all concerned with the implementation of the provision. On that basis I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only on a point of clarification. The fourth category mentioned by the Minister was that of housing expenditure. Perhaps I should know
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
the answer to my question, and I may do so by the time we reach the housing support grant clauses. Are school houses and janitors' houses, owned and let by the regional authorities, covered by that category?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The category that, among others, the Secretary of State would exclude in considering the net estimated expenses of a local authority—I used the phrase "expenses relating to housing"— are specifically those matters that are the subject of the housing support grant, which is quite distinct from the rate support grant. Therefore, my right hon Friend accepts that it would be inappropriate in the forthcoming year to include these in determining the total estimated expenditure of local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the sort of housing expenditure to which the hon Gentleman refers— for example, that incurred by an education authority on tied housing for teachers, or by a police authority for police officers—is not part of the housing support grant, and therefore would not come within that category. I shall check on that, but I should have thought that it would be part of a local authority's other expenditure and therefore would not be covered by 'this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is now turning very properly and relevantly to the most contentious and controversial clause in the whole Bill. Not only do the Opposition, object to it, but, we are supported by local authorities right across the 'political spectrum. I assure the Minister that we shall want to look at the clause very closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A plethora of amendments has been tabled and I ought to make it clear that we intend to try to deal with them fairly narrowly, because it is important that we have a clause stand part debate in which we can debate the general philosophy, if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a learning process with these amendments. Although this is not a particularly difficult piece of legislation to read, it is a little complicated, because one has to refer back to previous statutes and slot in new provisions. There is nothing peculiarly difficult in the words 'themselves. What is not clear is their intention and what exactly is in the mind of the Secretary of State, how he will operate the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
clause and what the various criteria are that will condition the practical consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments is the first of a series in which we shall try to discover exactly what is behind the revamping—if that is the right word—of the powers under section 5 of the 1966 Act and how it will be put into effect. At this point I should not like to commit us to voting or not voting on any of the amendments. I think that this will be one of these debates, or series of debates, where the Minister's replies will be of some importance. We shall listen to them with a great deal of interest, as will a wider audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 22. The subsequent two amendments are on similar lines. Amendment No. 28 merely removes the same words in similar circumstances in a later part of the clause. Amendment No. 25 also probes the meaning of the words "excessive" and "unreasonable", and whether merely financial criteria will be implied or whether more general considerations will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to a whole series of amendments on the new subsection (1A), which states that the Secretary of State may have regard
	<br><blockquote><p>"to general economic conditions; and to such other criteria as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
Those are rather frightening words to which we shall come in due course. I do not want to impinge in any way on later debates. It is a much narrower point to which I am asking the Committee to address itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our suggestion is that the trigger phrase "excessive and unreasonable" requires some explanation and perhaps further definition. I concede right away that the Minister has an easy answer to this debate —namely, that the words "excessive and unreasonable" appear in the 1966 Act, that (he was not responsible for that Act and, indeed, that a Labour Government were responsible for those words in that context on the statute 'book. The Minister will say—to use a good Scots phrase—that I should "baud ma wheest" and sit down. I am sorry to disappoint him. I am not responsible in any sense for the sins of my predecessors, if sins they be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman will appreciate that not only did those words appear in the 1966 Act, but they also appeared in the original Act passed by the Government led by Lord Attlee. I am not sure whether the hon Member would wish to dissociate himself from that Administration, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always taken the view that, however distinguished and honourable, the founding fathers are not necessarily infallible. Circumstances change. The great thing about the 1966 Act is that we have never had to look at it closely—at least in my time—because we have never had to use it. We have sensibly come to the conclusion that we should do more than pay lip service to ideas on local authority independence. It is now promised by no less an authority than the Secretary of State for Scotland that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it should prove necessary"—</p></blockquote>
I concede that qualification; we shall be interested
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
to know what it means and no doubt the Minister will tell us—the right hon Gentleman will
	<br><blockquote><p>"use those powers … with resolution and with vigour."— 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 21 January 1981; vol. 997, c. 346.]</p></blockquote>
I do not normally associate the words "vigour and resolution" with the present Secretary of State for Scotland, but I accept that we must pay some attention to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been promised in no uncertain terms that we shall be faced with the use of those powers. In those circumstances the words "excessive and unreasonable" become key words. They are the trigger which starts the whole mechanism, because the Secretary of State has to be satisfied that expenditure is "excessive and unreasonable" before the whole cumbersome and over-elaborate machinery can grind into action. The Opposition will be interested to discover from debates on later clauses the timetable for the various stages. I do not want to labour the point, but I think that I have established that the words are important and that we are entitled to ask what they mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two criteria. I presume that the person who drafted the Bill did not retain the words "excessive and unreasonable" because they were hallowed by tradition and had been spawned under the eye of the late Earl Attlee. I presume that there was something more concrete. I also assume 'that we did not merely go in for the phrase "excessive and unreasonable" because it had a nice cadence or because we could not resist the temptation of two words when one would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill becomes an Act, it will not be advanced as an example of deathless English prose. Statute is not normally drafted on the basis that it would be nice to have an additional adjective or a well-judged qualification because it would affect the balance of the English and make it that much more elegant. I pay the civil servants and the Minister the compliment—I am sure that it is well-earned—of thinking that if they say "excessive and unreasonable" they do so 'because they need 'both words, that they are both distinct, and that it should be possible to give examples and to define situations in which expenditure may be "excessive" 'but is not "unreasonable," or where expenditure may be "unreasonable" but is not "excessive". I presume that either will do—after all, the wording is not "excessive and"—and that expenditure does not need to fall under both categories in order to be caught in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon Gentleman has come to that conclusion. The word is "and", not "or". Clearly, the Secretary of State would have to be satisfied that the expenditure was excessive and unreasonable. Therefore, I suggest to the hon Gentleman that his amendments, far from narrowing the Secretary of State's discretion, would widen it in a way that the Government believe would be inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting, and I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance. I shall listen with an open mind to what he says. I understand his point; if we say that-the, expenditure must be "excessive

	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
and unreasonable", there may 'be a time when we tell an authority that its expenditure is totally excessive—a hideous and heinous example of excessive expenditure—but is not unreasonable, and therefore we cannot move against the local authority. Of course, the words can 'be played the other way round. We must investigate such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must first establish what each word means. That is a straightforward request. I am a layman; I am not steeped in the legislation of the 1940s and the subsequent uses of such terms. But, to me, "excessive" always suggests a narrow financial criterion. If expenditure is excessive, that suggests that it is too high against predetermined 'guidelines or standards that have been set down and against which it can be judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "unreasonable" suggests a wider moral disapprobation—that is, never mind what guidelines exist or what financial criteria are applied, there is another test, namely, whether the matter comes into ^the land of the sane and the reasonable. There might be something which 4s of little significance in the context of a local authority's total expenditure, but which might still be offensive because it is essentially stupid, wicked or obtuse. Those are two broad lay categories and I hope that the Under-Secretary will comment on that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little ashamed of what I am about to say, because in some ways it is the refuge of the weak-willed. But last night, perhaps spurred on by the rent restriction order debate, I went to the Library and referred to the Oxford English Dictionary, a publication of which I am rather fond. It is a monument to an ingenious Scotsman, Sir James Murray, and is one of the great monuments to Scottish ingenuity. I looked up the words "excessive" and "unreasonable", but it did not help me greatly; the two definitions so broadly overlap as to make it difficult for the ordinary mortal to distinguish between them. The word excessive is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"Transgressing the bounds of law, decency or morality; outrageous, lawless, wrongful … Exceeding what is right, proportionate, or desirable".</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exceeding what is right, proportionate, or desirable" might well amount to something that is unreasonable. The dictionary continued to define the word as "immoderate, inordinate, extravagant".</p></blockquote>
It is a remarkably comprehensive definition. To complicate matters further, "unreasonable" is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"Going beyond what is reasonable … excessive in amount or degree".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it was not my efforts that drove some hon Members from the Committee. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
find my contributions totally worth while, but I am prejudiced. Perhaps I should extend my sympathy to you, Mr. Gourlay, as the only member of the Committee who cannot turn and flee as I progress. If the Minister wishes to leave, he has my permission to do so, provided that he moves to adjourn the Committee as he goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the definition of "unreasonable", picking one phrase from it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Going beyond what is reasonable … excessive in amount or degree".</p></blockquote>
The Oxford English Dictionary tends to define unreasonableness in terms of excess, so that there is almost an entire overlap, which does not help the Committee a great deal. Indeed, perhaps the use of dictionaries is a little arid when predicting the twists and turns of a Conservative Administration's mind in their dealings with local government. I suspect that Sir James Murray and his collaborators on the Oxford English Dictionary were trying to move by the rules of logic and dispassionate common sense. Therefore, the guidelines they laid down are not necessarily the ones which will help us most in understanding the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Oxford English Dictionary has a splendid habit of illustrating words by example. Under "excessive" there was a quotation from David Hume, the famous Scottish philosopher:
	<br><blockquote><p>"excessive severity in the law is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution".</p></blockquote>
I hope that we can take that text for our time as we examine the clause. Labour Members believe that there is excessive severity in the provisions of the clause, and I hope that David Hume is right not only on his laws of deductive reasoning, but in this sentence, and that the excessive severity will mean that there will be a great relaxation in the execution of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, sadly I must confess that my brief visit to the dictionary late last night did not solve the problem. The Minister may say that the problem cannot be solved by predetermined definitions. The parameters of what is bound to be the Secretary of State's subjective judgment cannot be cabined, confined or pinned down. Maybe we shall have to live with that to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask for an explanation and an example. Example is often the best and most helpful form of definition. We can expect some help in deciding what is excessive and what is unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading some assistance was given. The Secretary of State was challenged by my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang), who asked whether it would be within the remit of the Secretary of State to brand as unreasonable, and, therefore, to move against, a local authority whioh decided to subsidise its bus fares heavily. The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am glad that the hon Gentleman made that intervention"—</p></blockquote>
in the light of experience, I and my colleagues approach that start with suspicion, but after that pleasantry had gained him the two or three seconds necessary to gather his thoughts, the right hon Gentleman said something useful and interesting:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have no intention, nor am I taking any power to look into the particular expenditure of any particular authority on any given item such as bus fares. I am seeking only to take a look at the general planned expenditure of a local authority."</p></blockquote>
Later he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not a question of my interfering in internal expenditure matters. They will remain matters for local authorities to determine within a reasonable overall level of expenditure."— 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; vol. 995, 	<i>c.</i> 1215.]</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister will, as always, hasten to agree with his superiors—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will go far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. No doubt the Minister will endorse the view of the Secretary of State. I take it from that that if a local auhority follows a particular line of policy—no matter how zany the Minister might think it, or how offensive to the doctrines of the free market economy of the founding fathers of nineteenth century Conservatism or whatever—will not interfere merely because he disagrees and thinks it an unreasonable individual policy. From that, we can take it that we are looking at global figures and nothing else. In that case, we are moving towards what one might call a measurement of excess against predetermined guidelines. What has the Minister to say about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a decision to subsidise bus fares or even to run free routes within a city—arguably an admirable policy initiative, but one which might fall under the stern, disapproving eye of the Under-Secretary—is not to be an individual matter, could the decision of a local authority to maintain a level of rents which the Minister thought unreasonable be one? I ask the Minister this question in all seriousness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Gentleman does not feel it necessary to expand on that point. I indicated when comimeniting on previous Government amendments that rents, which come under housing support grant, are excluded from the estimated expenses, so there is no possibility of that arising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ever?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not as the forthcoming year is concerned. My right hon Friend is giving local authorities advance notice of (the basis on which any decision in the forthcoming financial year will be reached. That is all that local authorities wish to know, and that is the information that he is giving them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I should perhaps have intervened to clear it up. The Minister spoke of the criteria to be applied for the forthcoming year. I take it, therefore, that in each successive year a similar, but not necessarily identical, intimation will be given. Will the same exemption be made in following years, so that housing finance will not be caught in the provisions of clause 13?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rate fund contribution to the housing revenue account were considerably higher than the
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
Government guidelines laid down in this year or in subsequent years, and an authority said that it would not stick to the guideline on the rate fund contribution but would allow it to go higher, thus creating compensating adjustments which the Minister might feel to be distortions—although other people might find them helpful compromises—on other parts of the authority's budget, would that decision also be exempted, or could it be brought under the phrase "excessive and unreasonable"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For reasons which the hon Gentleman will appreciate, I can give him answers only for the forthcoming year. Any rate fund contributions made to keep rents 'below a level at which they would otherwise have to be fixed would be a matter more probably dealt with under the housing support grant consideration, and therefore would not be relevant to these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I recognise that the Under-Secretary cannot necessarily bind future Administrations, and cannot even predict the actions of future Conservative Administrations. The question would not be relevant to future Labour Administrations. I am cautious about promises of repeal, because they are easy to make and hard to implement, but I can promise that there would be changes in this innovation under a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not very reassuring for the Minister to say "It will be all right for the first year", because we are writing into the statute now a piece of machinery which will last at least as long as this Conservative Government. It is to be hoped that that will not be long, but we should be provident and think in terms of protecting ourselves from even the ultimate disaster. The fact that the Minister has given assurances about year 1 is not helpful when we are constructing machinery for years 2, 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it impossible for the Minister to look sympathetically at an amendment to ensure that the type of rate fund contribution criterion about which I have been talking, and its consequent effect on rent levels, is permanently excluded from this machinery? If that were acceptable to the Minister, it would go a small but significant way to reassuring the Opposition and our colleagues outside. There is considerable fear that the machinery would be used as a spill-over sanction in housing finance. The one-year self-denying band does not carry the stamp of permanency that would dismiss those fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know already that the Government have been innovators in imposing penal sanctions. The remarkable decision to dock from the housing capital allowances arbitrary sums, pound for pound, against the shortfall from predetermined rent levels is an example of an innovation that we could well do without. It has 'been put 'to me bluntly and straightforwardly by a number of councillors that they are worried that that sanction might not be enough. In a sense, it has not been' enough, for a number of authorities have sensibly and bravely tried to work out more acceptable compromises and, in doing so, have had to defy the predetermined levels which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
Minister tried to impose, and they have paid a price in the form of a cut in housing capital allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated that matter on the Floor of the House a few days ago, and I do not wish to go over the arguments again, but Glasgow is only one example of such an authority. It has lost about £11 million on its housing capital allowance. Councils have said to me "It has not been effective. We defied it because the Government demanded lit and because the interest of our constituents and our district council demanded it. But we are worried because, next year, the Secretary of State, having seen that that big stick, with its ugly, nails, has not been enough to intimidate us, may try to use the proposals in clause 13 to achieve what his punitive depredations on the housing capital allocation have not achieved in the past."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough—I ask the Minister to think about it before our next sitting—merely to say "We shall be good boys and not do it this year, but I cannot promise that we shall not use these punitive sanctions in housing to enforce our increasingly artificial and restrictive straitjacket on local authorities in the years ahead". It might be worth while putting down an amendment to concentrate the Minister's mind and ensure that he makes the provision a permanent self-denying ordinance, so that clause 13, even though it may be used with unfortunate results in other ways, will not be used as a blunderbuss in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to go on for hour after hour, although we could do so, putting up—I was about to say "inventing" but perhaps that is pejorative— examples, I hope usefully, of what might be unreasonable or excessive and asking the Minister to comment on them. To some extent, the onus is on him to produce his definitions and examples. If, for example, a local authority had a heavy concentration of home helps, with a ratio of home helps to the elderly in the population which many, looking at the demands and needs of the elderly, might think reasonable but which was out of line with other authorities, might that be unreasonable? We have in the new subsection (1A) (a) a specific criterion for judging "excessive and unreasonable"—comparability with other local authorities. We shall wish to discuss that at the appropriate stage. I am not asking for a definition of the criterion in those terms; I am merely asking whether, when the Minister, with malice aforethought, turned to a particular local authority which had had the misfortune to transgress his private rules of good conduct, that might be deemed excessive or unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if a local authority failed to contribute to the 10,000 or 15,000 redundancies that the Minister is demanding in Scottish local authorities, would that in itself be unreasonable? Or must one go further and say that not only is it unreasonable but it has had a direct impact on predetermined guidelines which have been exceeded, and is therefore excessive? I recognise that the Minister says that they must be both, but we want to know what each contributes so that we can do the addition and see what the totality amounts to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are preliminary points to set some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
ground which we want to debate under this group of amendments. I know that some of my hon Friends wish to say a word or two. We shall wait with interest for the Minister's comments, and perhaps we can then consider whether we are in any way reassured. We have grave reservations about the whole concept, but perhaps something can be done to remove some of our worst fears, if the Minister is prepared to be conciliatory on the meanings of these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, it is a probing amendment. I take the Minister's point that it is probably not appropriate to remove the word, but it is inappropriate to do so only if he can establish that there is a real distinction between these words and can explain what the practical effects would be. We await his comments with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is too modest. I regard these as more than probing amendments, and I think that all my hon Friends will want to 'take part in the discussions on them. I appreciate that it creates some difficulty for you, Mr. Gourlay, because the amendments are almost "clause stand part" in their scope. I am not questioning your ruling, and I shall not pre-empt anything that you might say later, but perhaps I may spend a few minutes in backing up 'that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "reasonable" is fundamental to the interpretation and working of the clause. The only other important words, "and other relevant circumstances", are covered by another amendment. These words, together with "excessive", which I do not see in an amendment so far, are the crux of the clause. I am not (tempting you to rule me out of order, Mr. Gourlay, or to say that this will be a clause stand part speech. It will not be. But, for reasons that I shall give, these three amendments are fundamental and will give the Government the opportunity of explaining how they intend to apply the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is mo doubt from the information that we have had so far that some of these words, if not all of them, have been in previous legislation. On 9 December, when introducing the Bill, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill is therefore intended to achieve both a lessening of Government's controls over local authorities when the national interest is not concerned, and where there is a legitimate national interest in the conduct of local government, namely, in expenditure matters, the Bill will extend my powers of intervention."</p></blockquote>
Nobody on the Opposition side of the political arena is looking for a confrontation with the Government of the day, to take them on in an illegal manner. But, if those words of the Secretary of State mean anything, they mean that he is extending his powers because he sees that new circumstances have arisen, or are likely to arise, since the previous Acts were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that any Government, in the interests of the economic management of the country, must have some longstop powers. They do not necessarily have to ensure that local government expenditure, which is a major element in public expenditure, conforms in the detailed interpretation of that word, but it

would be absurd to assume that there is no need for any kind of legislation giving the Government back-up powers to control local authorities within the confines of national economic management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must explain in what circumstances clause 13 will be required and what criteria will be forthcoming to interpret "unreasonable" and "other relevant circumstances." Are these the words that are new? How will they be used? If they are not new, from where would the additional powers come to the Secretary of State? Are they in clause 14? I regard this as a most important matter, and I am worried about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State described how, having weighed up the advice he received about local authority proposals, and having had discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, he might work this system. Being a pragmatist, I am always interested in the mechanics and the timing. The right hon Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have concluded that the best course is to graft on to the existing system provision for discouraging high levels of expenditure by selective grant reductions."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; vol. 995, 	<i>c.</i> 1212-13.]</p></blockquote>
How will that be done? What are the selective grant reductions to be used?

I await with interest the comments of Conservative Members who are listening attentively to my words. After hearing their erudite contributions on Second Reading, I would find it refreshing if they went back on the vows of silence that they took on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill last year. Even the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) came into the Committee this morning to give a quorum. I follow his writings with great interest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not see that those writings are of interest in regard to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They certainly are of interest, Mr. Gourlay, but do not jump the gun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the point before, and said that I would keep it for a later date—and this is the later date. It is precisely relevant to the amendments under discussion. We have talked about "unreason-
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
able" expenditure and "other relevant circumstances". Although I am not a member of the Chairman's Panel, I believe that "other relevant circumstances" could cover almost everything in the whole area of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Gourlay. I am not trying to stray from the discussion; I am merely saying that I would like to hear from the so-called experts who write lengthy articles for the 	<i>Scottish Sunday Express.</i> I have always been interested in knowing what they receive for them. I was also interested in an article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> last week by the hon Member for Aberdeen, South. I wish that he would take part in these debates, so that we could get after him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman will quote from the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> the Chair would know whether the quotation was relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have it, Mr. Gourlay, though I have the 	<i>Scottish Sunday Express.</i> I can assure you that the articles are relevant, since they argue precisely for reform of the whole rating system because of the alleged unreasonable behaviour and expenditure of local authorities. I think that the hon Member for Aberdeen, South, would accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my remarks are totally related to what is regarded as unreasonable expenditure by local authorities. The Secretary of State made that the whole burden of his case for introducing clause 13. I cannot avoid the broader references, because the expressions "unreasonable" and "other relevant circumstances" make up the whole substance of clauses 13 and 14. Therefore, while I am making only passing references to some of the background material—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
