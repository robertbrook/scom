<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We stopped this morning for the Moderator's lunch, which was a most enjoyable and agreeable occasion. It is perhaps unfortunate that more Scottish people are not able to enjoy some of the benefits of Conservative government, although it would appear that the tradition of having lunches for the Moderator of the Assembly of the Church of Scotland is not a matter of political judgment. It is a matter of tradition and convention. I therefore do not suppose that even the Secretary of State would claim credit for this enjoyable social occasion, but we are grateful for the uncharacteristic gesture of generosity on the part of the Under-Secretary in allowing us to finish early. I hope that that generosity will become characteristic as the days and weeks and nights go on, now that we are meeting in double sessions.<br><br>
I am reaching the end of the group of amendments on which I have been speaking for what seems like weeks on end. We did not ask for them all to be grouped together, but in respect of paragraphs <i>(f)</i> and <i>(g)</i>— which are the paragraphs covered by amendments Nos. 50 and 51—we would like the Minister to expand on the reason for the inclusion of paragraphs 28A(3) <i>(f)</i> and <i>(g)</i> and let us know his intentions. We would be happy for these to be considered as probing amendments, and we would like to hear his views.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) will wish to return to amendment No. 44 at some stage.<br><br>
On amendment No. 45, we would like some consideration to be given to the volume of placing requests made in particular schools, and we would like to think that this factor would be considered. We feel that if too many requests are made and a school becomes denuded of certain groups of pupils, the viability of courses available at the school will be threatened.<br><br>
We do not think that the exercise of parental choice by a significant minority should be allowed to endanger the rights of the majority of children in the schools concerned. Amendment No. 45 is one of the most important amendments, and one with which all the professional teaching organisations are involved because they are concerned not only with the basic trade union aspects of teaching but—more important in some ways—with the professional standards of education and the quality of the service provided.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to draw attention to the serious dangers that could arise and affect the spread of courses, which everyone has accepted has been one of the most desirable features of comprehensive education. There would be a wider spread of education within the comprehensive system at least in years 3, 4, 5 and 6. Numbers are normally sufficient to afford a degree of flexibility in years 1 and 2. Options are open to parents to choose languages for their children and foundation or "taster" courses where subjects such as domestic science and technical drawing are available to children of both sexes.<br><br>
It is ironic that since the start of the comprehensive system in Scotland many young boys have been given the opportunity to take what used to be called cookery classes. From my experience I know that many youngsters, especially in cities, go on from those to further education courses—such as the City and Guilds—to prepare for employment in restaurants and hotels. It is important to sustain numbers in schools in order to retain that degree of flexibility. One problem likely to arise as a result of the uncontrolled and unfettered exercise of parental choice in certain schools is that the course choices open to the majority of parents for their children will be limited.<br><br>
Amendment No. 45 seeks to protect not only course choices, but the viability of courses. We recognise that other considerations are often involved. There is the capacity of education authorities to pay teachers' salaries, and there are the problems that arise when those salaries are not adequately funded because of cutbacks in the rate support grant.<br><br>
In many respects the problem will be exacerbated by the application of an unfettered and unrestricted choice among parents. It is important that educational aspects are taken into account when considering the question of parental choice if the viability of courses and the equality of educational opportunity are threatened.<br><br>
Our amendment will not affect a great number of schools, but a school can have an unfortunate name and be considered less attractive by parents. Because of its buildings or unfortunate publicity, or because schools close by enjoy better physical surroundings, the assumption is that school A is better than school B. I have taught in schools that are modern and well-equipped, and also in older traditional inner urban
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
schools where parents are anxious about the quality of education offered. Their anxieties are often ill-founded, but that does not necessarily prevent them from wanting to send their children to other schools.<br><br>
We recognise that parents have a right to choose, and we have stressed that all along. We want to see the right to choose made as freely available as possible, but, nevertheless, we do not see the right as inalienable if it interferes with the rights of other parents who are happy for their children to go to local schools.<br><br>
There are a variety of reasons for parents wishing to send their children to local schools. There may be several children in one family attending secondary school and it is often helpful if the older children can take the younger ones along. The travelling arrangement may be convenient. There may be a grandmother near who can give children lunch or look after them when the parents are out at work. These are non-educational, but very important, reasons, especially for working-class families in which a second wage is of considerable significance in boosting the family income.<br><br>
A vast number of children, especially in urban areas, are sent by their parents to local schools. Those parents have confidence in the capability of the local authority to sustain the education service which they think that their children require. But that confidence will be undermined if the unrestricted right of parents to choose to send their children elsewhere affects the viability and number of courses, and consequently the equality of educational opportunity.<br><br>
We consider amendment No. 45 to be very important. It is, in effect, an addendum, because it seeks to add a paragraph. We hope that it will be accepted by the Minister, because he must recognise the rights of parents whose children's education is already catered for in what the parents consider to be a satisfactory manner. It will clearly not be satisfactory if the quality of education is undermined by the unfettered exercising of parental choice by a significant minority in these schools.<br><br>
We would go further. We feel that education authorities are entitled to assistance in their longer-term education planning. There is a whimsical quality about the ways in which parents exercise parental choice. It is not always based upon fact or reason. We recognise that in a free society people must be entitled to indulge themselves—if that is the appropriate expression—but we do not think that that exercise of choice should harm children, interfere with their rights to a decent education, or undermine the capability of local authorities to provide education for the majority of children in the area in which the school is based. For those reasons, I recommend amendment No. 45.<br><br>
I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on amendments Nos. 50 and 51, which are probing amendments. It is also fair to point out that we shall not press amendment No. 11 to a Division.<br><br>
We are anxious that the Committee should accept amendments Nos. 43 to 45. As to amendments Nos. 9 and 10, we do not think that the relevant words—in one case an adjective and in the other an adverb—are necessary. Either it is, or it is not, expenditure. The fact that it is "significant" is vague. We hope that the Minister will say what he regards as significant. We should also like to know what he considers will "seri-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
ously" affect the continuity of a child's education.<br><br>
I realise that my speech has been given in three bits— or two bits and one wee bit. It is difficult to sustain its continuity. Nevertheless, I commend the amendments to the Committee and ask for its support.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to the welcome presence of the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must draw attention to the fact that while we are sitting in Committee it is not in order to refer to anyone in the Public Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Gourlay. However, many of us had the opportunity of having lunch today with the Moderator. Although he did not have the opportunity to address us on the Bill the Opposition should like to record the comments that he made in Perth over a week ago, particularly on the effects that Government policies are having on the young.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Gentleman must speak to the amendment. I am not sure that to speak about the comments of the gentleman in question would be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak to the group of amendments, with particular reference to amendment No. 9, which refers to the sub-paragraph on expenditure. The Moderator spoke about expenditure when he referred to Government policies, but the Opposition do not intend to waste the Committee's time by discussing a matter that can be discussed in other places.<br><br>
There is a good case for removing the word "significant" from subsection (3)(6)(ii), which I would alter the wording to read:
<br><blockquote><p>"give rise to expenditure on extending or otherwise altering the accommodation at or facilities provided in connection with the school".</p></blockquote>
A good reason for accepting the amendment is that it ties up this part of the sub-paragraph to make it more intelligible, something about which the Government seem to care very little as the debate proceeds. It takes the sub-paragraph out of the realms of subjectivity and into objectivity. Unless we do so, we may be bogged down by discussing the meaning of the word "significant".<br><br>
There is a whole world of difference between saying that the placing of children at specified schools will not take place if "significant" expenditure is incurred and saying if "expenditure" is incurred' It prevents the appeals committee and the courts from becoming involved in arguments about what is meant by the term "significant".<br><br>
It reminds me of the Monty Python-type sketch on television a few years ago about the football match between two schools of philosophers—The Existentialist XI and Bertrand Russell's All-Start Select. With a minute to go the Existentialists scored a goal, but Bertrand Russell begins to argue with the referee about the meaning of the word "goal". Russell eventually gets booked for dissent by the referee. I am sure that if I go any further I shall be booked by you, Mr. Gourlay, for straying from the amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
Unless we clean up the sub-paragraph we could have the courts deciding whether £20,000 spent on altering facilities at the school was significant extra expenditure or whether £5,000 was significant in a different case. It would be wrong to leave such doubt in the sub-paragraph. I am certain that it will do neither Scottish education nor the Scottish legal machinery any good to be involved in cases that merely revolve around the word "significant". I am sure that my region will use the word "significant" in the sense that I have. I wish to ensure that parents and children in the Tayside region do not have to go to the courts and argue about the word "significant".<br><br>
Our amendment gets rid of all this cotton wool because, as proposed in the Bill, if an extra ½p were spent on extending or otherwise altering the accommodation at the school the placing of the child could not take place. An irrefutable case would then exist, whereas in sub-paragraph (3) <i>(b)</i> (ii) as it stands no such case exists.<br><br>
The Government have announced a further £60 million cut in the Scottish education budget and I doubt whether any region will be able to indulge in the luxury of spending more on extending facilities in schools. The Minister responsible for education will be attending the closing rather than the opening ceremonies of many schools. The crucial point is that much of the Bill has candyfloss language in it. For the benefit of the layman —I wish to stress that in educational matters I am a layman—and for the courts, subsection (3) <i>(b)</i> (ii) must be made crystal clear.<br><br>
My hon. Friend and I tabled amendment No. 12 because we wished to avoid the parents' charter from being used, deliberately or otherwise, as a device to create prestige schools and ghetto schools. We believe that that would happen if primary schools were suddenly hit by a mushrooming of composite classes, or if secondary schools which lost pupils under the charter were to offer a restricted curriculum whereby pupils at one school were not able to have the opportunity to study the same range of O-grades and "highers" as before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me postulate the example that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) gave at a previous sitting of a secondary school with a declining roll and only two pupils who wish to take a minority subject. The school finds that it would be convenient for the parent to exercise his parental choice and move the child to another school where that subject is available and there are more pupils.<br><br>
Will the hon. Gentleman concede that that is a valid exercise of parental choice? The parent is choosing to move the child because the curriculum of the school which the child is attending is deteriorating as a result of declining numbers. Surely it is reasonable and democratic—I know that that is a word that the hon. Gentleman likes—that a parent should have the right to decide which subjects should be available to his child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of my children is at present discussing his O-grade options at his school in the Tayside region. I wish to ensure that all parents and pupils have that choice. Pupils are just as important as the parents. We are not here just to make sure that the parents have choice. We are here to ensure that the pupils themselves
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
have choice. There has been no restriction on the O-grades that my son wishes to take.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has made a hypothetical point and I do not think that it arises in many comprehensive schools in the Tayside region. It might occur in one or two remote localities in the hon. Member's constituency, and perhaps he can expand on the matter. As he is committed to it so strongly, perhaps he can explain it better than I can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) mentioned my example. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that in the circumstances that he was describing that it is better the local authority should take the major decisions about organisation of classes for minority subjects if this sort of problem exists. If the matter is left to parental choice, one parent might opt for one school, and another for a different school, and a viable class will not be created anywhere in the whole of that local authority's area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, but I intend to deal with that matter at the end of my remarks on amendment No. 12. Clearly, Opposition Members wish to ensure that both the education authority and the teachers are involved in such decisions. We do not want to see the teachers mucked about by clauses that may slip through the Committee. We do not want pupils at one school to be unable to have the opportunity to study the same range of O-grades and "highers" as before because pupils and teachers have been transferred to other schools.<br><br>
Composite classes in urban areas are a relatively new educational issue. Their appearance has been accelerated by the increase in public expenditure cuts in education. It is certain that parents have no wish to see their children in composite classes in city schools. In my constituency, when the Tayside region decided to create a composite class at St. Peter and Paul's primary school, I met a deputation of parents anxious to voice their concern at the creation of the composite class. They were worried about how it might affect their children's education performance. Parents are right to express concern about composite classes, and in the amendment we are expressing similar concern.<br><br>
The General Teaching Council for Scotland in recent years has condemned composite classes, claiming that in some areas of Scotland they are seriously injuring the fabric of primary education. The inspectorate in England has already produced some evidence of the effects upon educational performance of working in a composite class of mixed age groups compared with classes containing only a single year group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that every rural school that is organised in composite classes should be closed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon. Gentleman had been listening to what I was saying, rather than considering how to delay the Committee, he would have heard me state—as I am sure the record will confirm—that I was talking about cities, not rural areas. I should not wish to speak in the Committee about something of which I have little experience.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend not concede that we are talking about two quite specific and different types of educational organisation? Rural schools have had composite classes for many years. For financial reasons and, more importantly, because the numbers concerned have always been very small, they have been educationally acceptable. When there is a small number of children in a class, a composite class can be tolerated. In urban areas, where the figures involved are very different, the burden for both pupils and teachers becomes intolerable. The talk of maxima is a red herring, because class sizes in rural areas are traditionally far smaller than those in urban areas. It would be unfair and almost misleading to compare the two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is, of course, correct. I was about to make that point when my hon. Friend rightly intervened to draw the attention of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) back to the world of reality from the hinterland in which he seems to exist and from which he cannot even listen to what is said in the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman would like to read my notes later on I shall make them available to him. I am sure that he will find them very enlightening. It is clear that he does not understand why he is here or what is going on.<br><br>
The inspectorate in England found that, on average, children in composite classes of 25 to 35 scored worse in a standardised test than did those in a single-year group class. It also found that the work of those children was less well matched to their capabilities than was the work of children in classes of the same size containing a single-year group.<br><br>
Clearly, composite classes can pose a threat to the educational progress of children. Our amendment rightly draws attention to the need to protect the organisation of a class. We do not want to see subjects disappearing out of the window in secondary schools.<br><br>
Last week the Government announced a reduction in the Scottish education budget of £60 million, which is equivalent to the elimination of 6,500 teaching jobs. The effect of this move to cut money and teachers as the school roll falls, with no built-in safeguards, will be serious and damaging. There will be a "domino" effect: fewer pupils mean fewer schools. <i>The Scotsman</i> of 11 September 1979 reported:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Fletcher had repeated his view that with the secondary school population expected to decline by about 100,000 in the next 10 years, difficult decisions on individual school closures were inevitable."</p></blockquote>
5 pm<br><br>
Smaller school rolls will bring a smaller choice of SCE examination subjects. If 6,500 jobs are to disappear at the same time, likely casualties will be the classics— Latin and Greek—and the sciences, mathematics and physics. Unless we build in a proviso to prevent the creation of a restricted curriculum we shall build up trouble on two fronts. First, we shall be taking a step backwards into the past, going back along the road to the old senior secondary-junior secondary set-up by creaming off the best pupils and leaving the rest to be educated in schools that are unable to offer the same choice of curricula.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
Secondly, once schools begin to offer restricted curricula, the education authority will face an angry teaching profession. The Government have already been warned by the EIS that attempts to produce even more strain in areas where teachers work under severe pressure will only add union problems to education ones.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) know all about the pressures on the class teacher at "the chalk face". We shall only poison industrial relations between teachers and employers further if teachers are packed off to one school after another because of this measure.<br><br>
Finally, if we do not introduce this buffer provision unscrupulous regional authorities will use the excuse of restrictive curricula and falling school rolls to justify closing schools, not for education reasons, but on the ground of cost. As an example I ask the Committee to consider Tayside region—an authority that is despised, I would say, throughout the length and breadth of Dundee. As rolls fall and the curriculum in a school is restricted the staffing cost per pupil will rise.<br><br>
Tayside region has ensured that a new Arbroath high school will be built presumably—one expects this from the Tory Members on that authority—so that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) will retain his seat at the next general election. I have no doubt that the school is needed, and I support the building of a new Arbroath high school, but the need for that school is no greater than the need for an Ardler high school in my constituency. However, there will be no Ardler high school because the parents in that constituency vote for Labour.<br><br>
We must have this type of provision in the Bill to ensure that decisions of that sort, which I believe are politically motivated, do not work against the parents of pupils in Tayside region who do not vote for the party that controls the region. Of the amendment that has been tabled by my hon. Friends is not accepted, Tayside region will use the Bill as an excuse to close schools in Dundee, where the political effect upon the Tayside Tories will be virtually nil.<br><br>
I deal next with amendment No. 45. As my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire showed, perhaps the word "amendment" is not the correct terminology for this Committee. Perhaps we should be talking about an addendum. The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the number and nature of placing requests is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on the viability of courses and the equality of educational opportunity available for children at any school or schools under the management of the education authority".</p></blockquote>
That sub-paragraph is very important to Labour Members.<br><br>
The amendment covers some of what is dealt with in amendment No. 12.1 want to extend its net to raise the concept of "equality of educational opportunity". By that we mean that children of differing intellectual abilities should be given the opportunity to develop their potential to its limits.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I quoted from various research reports showing that middle-class children in Scotland have on the whole a superior educational performance to working-class children in terms of O-grades and higher qualifications. I argue today, as I did then, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
the root causes of this difference lie in the differing environments and economic circumstances of the two social classes. Economic and social factors play an important part in shaping educational success. Although they are not catered for in the Bill, the Minister, in his other role as Minister responsible for industry, must create the jobs necessary to give many working-class people currently unemployed the relative economic security to enable them to spend more time on giving priority to their children's education.<br><br>
The words in the amendment
<br><blockquote><p>"the number and nature of placing requests"</p></blockquote>
mean that we do not wish to see a rush by middle-class parents to send their children to one of the prestigious schools while working-class parents have to have what is left. This would only exacerbate a situation that already seethes with educational disadvantage. One researcher has estimated that 20 per cent, of the total Scottish population suffer or suffered from some degree of educational or social disadvantage. I wish the Minister to give the reasons why the Bill does nothing to alter that percentage.<br><br>
In placing requests, we shall see the halo effect coming into force. One attribute of a person is taken—say, the lower socio-economic class—which is then related to lower intelligence or lower educational attainment. Similarly, a higher socio-economic class is related to higher intelligence or higher educational attainment. Whether it is true or not is irrelevant, but these judgments are made. Any Government Member who refuses to believe that ought to consult at least one elementary textbook on psychology or sociology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:What happens if two children from different class backgrounds apply for a place at a certain school and the application is processed by the bureaucracy in the education authority? I am talking not about NALGO members but about the top brass.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is likely that they would award the place to the middle-class child. Indeed, it would be interesting to see what happened if the working-class child had a better educational record than the middle-class child but the bureaucracy did not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The rule in Committee is the same as in the House. One is allowed to use fairly fulsome notes, but it is out of order to read an entire speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirlingshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have seen Ministers doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. A Minister of the Crown, when replying to a debate, is entitled to read a departmental brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The reason why I am quoting so extensively from notes is that this is a particularly important
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
matter. You will have noticed, Mr. Gourlay, that I did not give way when the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) wished to intervene. The reason was that I wanted to finish this important section. I take your point, Mr. Gourlay, but I ask you to understand that we are talking about education, which is a fairly extensive area. If the Committee is to ask the Minister for safeguards in the Bill for those whom we represent, those of us who do not come from the education profession may wish to use reasonably extensive notes to ensure that the Minister understands what we are saying and which parts of the Bill we are questioning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell us the name and author of one of the textbooks on psychology to which he has just referred. I should be interested to hear about one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That will be in order provided that it does not take us too far from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:When I sit down, I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with the information that he requested. During the Second Reading debate, I quoted from the research carried out by Aberdeen University and also from the Taylor report. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to have the specific books, I shall provide them for him.<br><br>
I believe that it is relevant to raise the issue of a child being school-less in the same way as a family is homeless. I know that Conservative Members may not agree with that, but we wish to hear the Minister's comments when he replies to this group of amendments. We represent a whole range of working-class and middle-class backgrounds, but we see nothing in the Bill that will benefit the overwhelming majority of children who attend schools in our constituencies and who come mainly from working-class homes. We also fail to read into the Bill or even to hear hon. Members opposite mention any commitment to State sector education or to their intention of improving it. That is why we have tabled this series of amendments.<br><br>
The Opposition wish to bring the various social and economic classes together, to cut out many of the inequalities that exist, and especially those that exist in respect of the Scottish education system. I urge the Government to think carefully before voting against any of our amendments in this group. The Committee may not be well reported in the Scottish press, but hon. Members should be aware that, even in their own constituencies, the majority of parents in Scotland are taking a great interest in the Bill. Clearly, they believe that only one side of the Committee is concerned about the education of their children. The record of the Committee does not show that there is any intention by Conservative Members other than outwith the Front Bench to assist those parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. Those remarks do not refer to the amendment and are therefore not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I was simply winding up and thought that you understood that, Mr. Gourlay. Perhaps I should have indicated that I was about to sit down. I was simply inviting the Conservative Members—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. An invitation to hon. Members to speak is out of order, because every Committee member has the right to speak when he catches my eye. Therefore, there is no need to invite hon. Members to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am glad to have that information, and I am sure that Conservative Members are, too, because it appears to us that they were unaware of it. However, having made them so aware, I shall now sit down and hope that some of them will catch your eye, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitated to speak on the group of amendments because I had noticed that amendments Nos. 21 to 24 were in the names of the hon. Members for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), and I was waiting to see whether one of them would get to his feet to speak in support of those amendments; but as neither of them has done so, I am happy to speak in support of ours. I find it surprising that hon. Members put down amendments on the Amendment Paper and then do not bother to attempt to speak to them. I am not inviting them to do so because, as you rightly said, Mr. Gourlay, they have—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Gentleman is trying cleverly to skate round my previous ruling. I hope that he will now turn to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly turn to the amendments, and I shall also say something about theirs as they are not prepared to do so. The group of amendments covers several points which are linked in that they cover the various ways in which local authorities do not have to apply their rulings about parents' freedom of choice. Our amendments attempt to make the exclusions more precise and, in a sense, more particular and to give the local authority a greater opportunity to refuse that choice, whereas the Government amendments were designed to make it easier for parents to have freedom of choice and more difficult for local authorities to refuse it. That is where the difference between us lies.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
It can be argued that some of our amendments—the first group, with the exception of amendment No. 12— are essentially trying to give the Bill some legal significance that it would not otherwise have. Anybody who uses words as part of his job knows that the words "seriously", "significant", "continuity of" can be interpreted in a variety of ways. I should have thought that those Conservative Members who are also lawyers would wish to see those words taken out, because they can be interpreted in many different ways, but perhaps they want such words left in so that they can make a little more money interpreting the words in the courts.<br><br>
However, we feel that words such as "significant" are open to so many different interpretations that it would be a quagmire for the appeals committees and the sheriff to have to decide, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) said, whether £10,000 or £20,000 spent by a school was significant.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
In a small rural primary school, is £200 or £500 significant? What is "significant"? Extra textbooks, extra scientific equipment, extra standard items have to be provided for every child entering a school. I do not suggest that that is significant, but it might be argued to be so in a court of law by an education authority that did not wish to see a child go to a particular school. Furthermore, if the school were small, it might be significant.<br><br>
So many different interpretations can be given to words; serious difficulties are created for the courts when they have to interpret the law. We do not want the courts to have a say in the adjudication of educational matters, but, if they are to do so, they must have an Act before them giving them clear guidance on how their duties should be carried out.<br><br>
Amendment No. 12, which is essentially an addendum, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the transfer would result in any change in the class organisation or curriculum of either of the schools affected."</p></blockquote>
That amendment, with No. 45, hits at the very root of our argument about freedom of choice. It is not a problem concerning only the rights of the individual child or parent to make choices or concerning only the school receiving that child. It also concerns the effect of that freedom of choice on the education and rights of the children in the school from which the child is coming. That is why we have tabled these amendments, which make it clear that we are concerned about
<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the class organisation or curriculum of either of the schools".</p></blockquote>
It is not just the school to which the child is going, but the one that he is leaving, perhaps a so-called unpopular or popular school.<br><br>
I am sorry to see that the hon. Member for Argyll has left us—I am sure that it is only briefly, because he has been following the discussion fairly closely. He referred to composite classes in relation to class organisation. I have been in primary schools in the nether regions of Lanarkshire, around Abington and such places, in small villages where there is only one class in the school for children from the age of five to the age of 12—a composite class. It is essential that such schools should be maintained, because they are the centre of the community or small village that they serve. If the Minister responsible for education has his way, I am sure that many of these small rural schools will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Many of the villages will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that many of the villages may disappear under this Government's economic policies, but certainly the single-class schools may disappear. They are there, but that is not to say that the composite class is desirable. What I find most remarkable about the hon. Member for Argyll is that, when we are talking about primary schools, he leaps to his feet to defend the idea of the composite class, but, when it comes to secondary school education, he attacks the idea of mixed-ability classes. He cannot have it both ways. A composite class, by its very nature, has to be a mixed-ability class. How can he say that it is right for primary schools to have mixed-ability composite classes but wrong for secondary schools? I find it difficult to follow that argument.<br><br>
I am saying that composite classes of themselves are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
not desirable. Where there are extra benefits to be gained from keeping schools in existence to maintain communities, we may have to have and support a composite class. But where a one-age-group class in a primary school in an urban area, or even in a small town or fairly large village, can be maintained but, because of the Bill, would become a composite class, that I consider to be undesirable.<br><br>
Greater expenses are involved in composite classes. The way in which a teacher must organise her work and the amount and sort of material that she has to use put greater demand on a teacher and also on the amount of money that she has to spend. Again, under this Government, next year the primary school children of Strath-clyde are likely to have about 4p per day spent on their school materials, so the problems of composite classes will become even greater, because teachers will not have the money to spend on materials.<br><br>
In secondary schools, the effect on the curriculum is vital. I ventured to say in an earlier debate that this was a matter of grave concern in my constituency—and in others—where a middle-class area and a large housing scheme were side by side, with a so-called middle-class secondary school and one or two secondary comprehensives in the large housing schemes as well. Where a few parents can move their children from one to the other. It is because of the effects that that can have upon the communities and schools in the large housing schemes that we have tabled the amendment. The curriculum could be altered in the affected schools by the withdrawal of pupils rather than by pupils moving in.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Argyll asked about minority subjects. I accept that we shall see declining rolls in secondary schools over the next 10 years, and that there will be problems in connection with the minority subjects. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West mentioned Latin and Greek, but it may be subjects such as Russian or Spanish—languages that are often taught in schools nowadays—or economics and other subjects of a similar nature that will be our major concern.<br><br>
Local authorities will have to consider how they can ensure that children who want to study the subjects that are taken up by fewer pupils will be able to do so. In my view, parental choice is not the way to do it. The exercise of parental choice could create a diversity across a number of schools. It might be better for the local authority to say that, if parents wish their children to learn Spanish or Russian, for instance, there is one school in an area that will serve that need. The parents will then be able to choose the subject, but it will be the local authority, not the parents, which will decide at which school that subject is taught and, consequently, to which school the child is sent.<br><br>
<i>Under the Bill, things would happen in a haphazard</i> manner, by chance, and local authorities would have to shift the specialist teachers of such subjects from one school to another as fashions changed. In one year, there might be 10 children in a school wanting to study Russian, and in the next year there might be only two in that school and 15 in another, and so the Russian teacher would have to be shifted, year by year, from school to school. It is the local authority that should be taking the decisions on such matters. The comments of the hon. Member for Argyll were a red herring.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
It is not only the fringe subjects that could be affected. As a result of this legislation, problems could be created in the so-called unpopular schools for the major and most important subjects in our modern society— subjects such as mathematics, science and English. The Minister is cutting the numbers of teachers and closing colleges of education in Scotland, but I know that in my own constituency, in Castlemilk, in the large housing scheme schools, it is already difficult to get enough teachers of mathematics and science.<br><br>
If fewer and fewer children—particularly academically bright children—are staying in a school or going into that school, the ability of that school to sustain even O-level courses, and certainly higher level courses, in the basic subjects of mathematics and science, will be affected. Then the parents who are perfectly happy to leave their children at that school and do not want to move them but who want those children to take mathematics at O-level or higher level will find that they have to shift (heir children because there is to be no course at that school.<br><br>
That is not parental choice; that is pressure on parents to do what they do not want to do. The exercise of choice by a few parents will force the others into that situation.<br><br>
As I have said, when schools become essentially second-class schools, the impact on the community will be disastrous. The morale of the teachers will be eroded because they will feel that they are not doing worthwhile jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are not interested in the morale of teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the morale of the teachers falls, the morale of the school falls. When children at the age of 12 or so come into a secondary school, they need the peer incentive—to look not to the teachers but to the top of the school to see where they are aiming—and if few pupils at the top of that school are trying to achieve academic success, the children coming up in the school do not aim to achieve academic success, either.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Guidance is needed from academic pupils at the top of a school to lead the others up. I do not believe in academic streaming—though the hon. Member for Argyll may leap to his feet to say that that is what it is. But younger children in a school need incentive and to be able to look at older pupils and say "That is what I would like to be like. I want to be like Joe Smith—he's doing O-levels, he's doing Highers and is aiming to do such and such a course when he finishes school".<br><br>
If there are no such pupils in the school, or very few, guidance of that sort is not available. The younger children then lapse into the same sort of attitude as the older pupils, and that can be extremely damaging to a school. Once a school has become dispirited, the community loses. A school is more than a place where children are educated in a community: it is part and parcel—even the centre—of many communities. It is where meetings are held and local groups get together and where people go for evening classes.<br><br>
Once that centre of the community has begun to be destroyed—as could happen under this part of the Bill unless our amendments are accepted—enormous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
educational and social problems are created for our society. If such a thing happens in our society, it will affect not only communities but the whole of our economic life. One of the major causes of our social and economic problems is that we have never educated to a high enough standard a large enough percentage of our young people. Compared to other countries, we have one of the lowest proportions of children staying on at school after 16, and that is one of the causes of our economic problems.<br><br>
If large numbers of children are unable to obtain the courses they require for the academic qualifications they need to stay on after 16 and to go to further education colleges, universities and so on, our economic position will become worse.<br><br>
I should have liked to speak to one or two other amendments in this group, but I think that I have said sufficient, so I shall conclude by saying that I support my hon. Friends' amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Much as I am tempted, I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time, but I should like to make a few brief remarks on this group of amendments, some of which are in my name and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart).<br><br>
All the Opposition amendments in the group are designed for one reason only—to put as many obstacles as possible in the way of parental choice. I should have much more respect for the Opposition if they had tabled an amendment to say that there should be no parental choice at all. At least we would then know where they stand. But they pay lip service to parental choice and at the same time put more and more obstacles on the course as every minute passes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I notice that another Adjournment debate has just started on the Floor of the House. The next one will be on a motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) on the important subject of the quality of education, which is of great concern to every member of the Committee.<br><br>
<i>I understand that the Under-Secretary of State</i> who is responsible for education will have to reply to the debate, which may start in a few minutes. May we therefore adjourn the Committee until further notice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. There is no way that the Chair can accept an adjournment motion for such a purpose. Proceedings in the House often coincide with proceedings in Committee. We cannot adjourn for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I think that we must challenge your ruling, and point out that in recent months when there has been Scottish business both on the Floor of the House and in Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I am seized of the hon. Gentleman's point that there has been an occasion when arrangements have been made between the two parties. But that has not arisen, unless the Minister is prepared so to move.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Will you indicate when you will be willing to accept a motion to adjourn, if not now, perhaps when the hon. Member presently speaking on the Floor of the House finishes and the Minister replies? That Adjournment debate could be lost unless the hon. Member for Cathcart is present. The Minister may deliberately be trying to engineer that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am seized of the points of order that have been made. My ruling is clear. We cannot <i>adjourn the Committee because there is a debate on</i> a Scottish matter in the Chamber. It is a matter for the Minister to decide where he will be, but in the meantime the Committee will proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friends may be intrigued to note that, although the Opposition have asked all afternoon for a Conservative Member to speak, the moment one rises, they try to suspend the Committee.<br><br>
I return to the amendments. The Opposition wish to leave out just about every qualifying adjective in the clause. They wish to leave out "significant", "normally" and "continuity of the". All their additions have exactly the same motivation in mind. Every one is intended to put further obstacles on the course. When they have finished, there will be more obstacles on the course than there are on the Cheltenham race course today.<br><br>
Let us consider some of the examples used by the two hon. Members who know something about education and who demonstrated that by giving practical examples. The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) mentioned French in schools. He said that a parent might decide to move his child from school A to school B, although school B might not teach French. Opposition Members are always telling us that comprehensive education in Scotland is terrific. I am amazed that they can postulate, even in theory, that a comprehensive school in Scotland does not teach French. It is all right using a theoretical argument, but they might think about telling us which secondary school in Scotland does not teach French.<br><br>
But let us continue the theoretical gallop—which is what they have been doing for a long time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member, as a maths teacher, should be able to count, although it is alleged that many teachers are unable to do so. In some secondary schools, in years one and two—which is what I was talking about —very often there is a complete class of some 33 children learning French. It is not unreasonable to assume that there could be a set of classes learning French which are completely full in years one and two. There would then be no opportunity for those other children to continue learning that subject because the class numbers would already be up to the acceptable limits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman has changed tack a little. When I was taking notes, he distinctly said that parents had moved their children to a school with no French. I accept the theoretical possibility that every class would be full. But I wonder what would happen if a parent moved into the area and wanted to send his child to that school.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
The theory is that the parent who wants to change his child's school because he is intersted in the child's education will be prepared to sacrifice French willy nilly. I find that very difficult to understand. If the child is to change schools, I suggest that the parent will have taken that into consideration. But then parents were accused by the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire of wanting to change their children's schools for capricious reasons. We add that to his other descriptions of parents who might want to change their children's schools—moaning parents, and alienated parents. We can see that what he really wants is to allow parents no choice at all, and, if they do want a choice, they fall into one of those categories.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) also used the example of a language. He said that a school in the vicinity might provide Spanish and that those children whose parents wanted them to learn Spanish would opt to go to that school. In other words, the school prospectus would come out—how else would parents know—and parents would be told that schools A and B did not have Spanish and school C did. A parent would then choose and the local authority would be willing for the child to go to school C. That is exactly what parental choice is about—to give parents some choice in the matter. If a school provides a certain course or quality, the parent can choose to send his child to it, and not to the local school which may not provide what the parent wants. I do not know whether we should welcome the hon. Member for Cathcart to the ranks of the parental choice group. Possibly not.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then went on to qualify it a little. He said that if too many of the children who chose Spanish left a certain school, or did not go to it, that could affect mathematics teaching. Then I suppose we should have to reverse the position. The hon. Gentleman did not say, although I suppose that it was implied, that if too few children did mathematics, there would not be enough competition to stimulate them. I accept that he probably did not mean that, because competition is not to be encouraged, according to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
But we have had this all before. We discussed what is happening against the background of declining school roles. If there are declining school roles, there seems to be an even better case for parents to have a choice. Their children can then go to schools which can provide the courses and syllabus and—I will go further—the kind of disciplinary and ethical system that the parents may want.<br><br>
If a school is going downhill and becoming second class, the sooner all the parents opt to send their children to other schools, the better for all the children in the vicinity. I should have thought that that was excellent, rather than bolstering up a very poor, declining-role school by forcing children to continue to go to it instead of to others.<br><br>
My amendments do the opposite. They are designed to remove some of the obstacles from the course which I fear the Minister had left in for the parents to jump.<br><br>
In amendment No. 21, I seek the deletion of paragraph (6)(iii). I do that because I am concerned about the words "seriously detrimental to the continuity of the child's education."<br><br>
The Opposition want to delete the word "seriously".<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
If a teacher decided to transfer a child from one class to another, the chances that the two classes were on exactly the same level would be quite remote, unless the principal teacher organised a very military-type institution—I did not, although I accept that some Opposition Members may well have run such institutions.<br><br>
When children change classes or schools because their parents move house, they cannot dovetail exactly in every subject. They may dovetail in some, be ahead in some and be behind in some. That happens now, and I see no reason why that cannot be accepted as the small price to pay for parental choice while the child is in the primary or the secondary school. Of course, the school choice between primary and secondary is irrelevant.<br><br>
I should like my hon. Friend to consider whether he needs this provision. I hope that he will resist the Opposition's amendment to delete "seriously" and consider my amendment to delete the whole subparagraph, because it creates a hurdle over which it is unnecessary for parents to be asked to jump.<br><br>

In amendment No. 22,1 ask for the word "seriously" to be put in before "detrimental" for exactly the opposite reason that the Opposition wish to remove the word "seriously" in the previous subparagraph. They wish to diminish the word "detrimental", whereas I wish to enhance it. I think that "seriously" would be an important addition to subsection (3)(6)(iv). Merely to be
<br><blockquote><p>"detrimental to order and discipline in the school"</p></blockquote>
might be comparatively easy to prove in a variety of ways, and the authority might find it a useful scapegoat. I am sure that the Minister put the word "seriously" in subparagraph (iii) deliberately, and I am equally sure that the Opposition want it deleted for the same reason. That convinces me that "seriously" is a useful addition to the arm of a parent in having parental choice.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will consider the amendment. It is not a probing amendment but a serious effort, as opposed to a mere effort to get him to think again about the way that the Bill is worded.<br><br>
Amendment No. 23 seeks to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or the educational well-being of the pupils there"</p></blockquote>
from the end of subparagraph (iv). This is more of a probing amendment, because I cannot understand in what circumstances that phrase would be used. It is difficult to see when a child attending a school would damage the educational well-being of the other pupils. Will my hon. Friend explain that, and convince me that the phrase is needed and that my amendment to delete them is unnecessary?<br><br>
Amendment No. 24 deals with paragraph (c). I am puzzled by the words "ability or aptitude". Let me put the phrase in context. Those children who fall within the special educational needs of the paragraph are already catered for in paragraph (e). So who is left who will not have the ability or aptitude to go to the school? I can understand that it could be on the basis of age if a parent of a child of 11 wanted him to go to a secondary school, but I cannot understand the ground of "ability or aptitude".<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
We have comprehensive education. Surely every school is suited to the ability and aptitude of all pupils, with the exception of the special educational needs which are catered for later. I can foresee this paragraph being used by education authorities for social engineering along lines of which the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) would approve. I fear that the provision could be used by a local authority to enhance a zoning system designed to do such social engineering and to put able children into a poor school to get the balance that the hon. Member for Cathcart would like, regardless of how far out of their environment they care to move or how opposed their parents are.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend explain why we need the words "ability or aptitude"? Simply to say that they have always been put in education Acts is not good enough. With due respect, the education Acts were written when there were junior and senior secondary schools and therefore "ability or aptitude" were appropriate. Today, we have comprehensive education. If all the schools are reasonably equal—which the Opposition tell us they are, but which I doubt—there is no need to include in this new Bill the words "ability or aptitude" just because they were appropriate in the past.<br><br>
I look forward to my hon. Friend's reply. I trust that he will give way to me on some of his answers to our questions and that he will at least agree with me that the fewer hurdles there are to the parents on parental choice, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish first to speak to amendment No. 44, which calls for the deletion of paragraph (e). That paragraph refers to children with special educational needs, who were the subject of study by the Warnock committee.<br><br>
We have heard a lot from the Tory side of the Committee, including the Minister, about freedom of choice, the parents' charter and so on. It is my experience that the majority of parents in Scotland are reasonably satisfied with the degree of freedom of choice that they have. The Tory side of the Committee has failed to produce any evidence to the contrary. However, there is one group of parents, who may be in a minority, but whose children ought to be the most important of all in educational priority—the parents of children who are handicapped, either physically or mentally or, in some cases, both. Many other children who were the subject of study by Mrs. Warnock's committee—may have difficulties of a temporary nature or have been in remedial education at some stage in their life or possibly for the major part of their education.<br><br>
I hope that we have agreement on both sides of the Committee that it is desirable to extend the freedom of choice of parents of such children. At present, if there is one group of parents and children whose freedom is more limited than that of any other group, it is those who were the subject of the Warnock committee's study. It appears to me to portray the hypocrisy of the Government's so-called parents' charter and their so-called claims to parental freedom, when they produce a so-called parents' charter and then say that they cannot extend that charter in the case of children with special educational needs if the parent wants the child to go to an integrated set-up in an ordinary school, but would require extra money to do so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
I know that there may be divisions of opinion on the desirability of educating disabled and handicapped children in an integrated set-up. There are divisions of opinion even among specialists, including specialist teachers who have spent practically all their working lives dealing with these children. But in the last analysis, if the Government want to extend parental freedom and particularly freedom of choice, they cannot exclude these children deliberately, when their parents want them to go to an ordinary school and have taken the decision, presumably after listening to what the experts have to say. The parents say "I would like my child, who is disabled, to go to school X or school Y", but in this legislation the Minister is saying "I am sorry. You cannot, because you do not have the same rights as the woman next door, whose child is not handicapped. You have the misfortune that your child is handicapped, so you will not have the same freedom of choice".<br><br>
This phoney charter will not apply to the children most in need of an extension of freedom—disabled children.<br><br>
I want to refer briefly to what the Warnock report said about special education in ordinary schools, because it is important to the amendment. I shall refer particularly to those parts of the report which would require extra expenditure in order to adapt an existing school to accommodate children with special educational needs. On page 345 of the Warnock report there is a summary of some of the recommendations. About school-based resource centres it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where one does not already exist, some form of resource centre or other supporting base should be established in large schools to promote the effectiveness of special educational provision."</p></blockquote>
Admittedly it says "in large schools", because Mrs. Warnock and her committee realised that some of the proposals would require increased capital and other expenditure—in some cases significantly more expenditure.<br><br>
It would perhaps be unrealistic at this stage to imagine that we could adapt every type of school in Scotland to accommodate any type of handicapped child. There are limits, and in some cases there may be valid educational arguments for saying that the child should be educated in a special school. That educational argument appears to be already catered for under paragraph (c), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the education normally provided at the specified school is not suited to the age, ability or aptitude of the child".</p></blockquote>
So if the educational specialists, after assessing the child, tell the parents "We are sorry. We don't think that the particular school that you have opted for is in the best educational interests of your child", then even under paragraph <i>(c)</i> the authority would be relieved of its responsibility to place the child in the school which the parents had chosen. In other words they would be saying to the parents "We are sorry. In this case we think that your decision is unwise on certain educational grounds"—and presumably they would have to set out the educational grounds.<br><br>
We have here an attempt by the Government to relieve local authorities completely of their responsibility to put handicapped children into an ordinary school, if significant additional expenditure is required. I sympathise with local education authorities because of the severe restraints that the Government have put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
on them, constraints which were worsened by the Budget last week and the votes last night.<br><br>
Surely the way to deal with the problem is not to relax any statutory obligation on the local authority, but to ensure that local education authorities have adequate resources to meet their statutory obligations. If the statutory obligation were retained in this case, instead of there being what may be called the relief from statutory obligation given by paragraph (e), the Ministers—and I am glad that the Minister responsible for the Health Service in Scotland is in the Committee now, as well as the Minister responsible for education— ought to be aware of the problems of these children and ought to be fighting to give them more money, especially this year, the International Year of Disabled People. Instead of coming out with a few paltry sums of money here and there, if the Government are to do any more than to pay lip-service to helping the disabled, I think that they ought to ensure that a provision is built into this Bill so that the parents of disabled children have the same rights as parents of other children and so that local education authorities are given enough money to see that these rights are fulfilled.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
I mentioned the
<br><blockquote><p>"resource centre or other supporting base"</p></blockquote>
described in Warnock. Although it might be impracticable to apply it to every school, I think that in the case of large schools it would be appropriate for the Government to encourage local authorities to set up a resource centre or supporting base. Yet, instead of encouraging local authorities to take initiatives in this matter, paragraph <i>(e)</i> discourages the local education authorities from building extra school-based resource centres and so on to convert at least the larger schools to accommodate handicapped children so that they can be educated in an integrated set-up where that is their parents' wish. The Warnock report then states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a resource centre, special class or base is organised internally by the headteacher, the local education authority should arrange for the necessary staff and other resources to be made available to the school and should ensure that they are used for that purpose".</p></blockquote>
We all know that. We know that these extra resources referred to by Warnock will cost extra money. The Government should be providing that money instead of discouraging the education authorities from providing these extra facilities.<br><br>
Another item which would require extra expenditure is recommendation 7, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local education authorities should ensure that a school with a special class or unit is allotted an extra specialist teacher to its staffing complement."</p></blockquote>
Yet instead of providing these extra teachers, which again would mean extra expenditure, the type of significant expenditure referred to in paragraph (e), the Government are proposing to encourage local authorities to sack over 6,000 teachers, at a time when we should be employing more teachers, including specialist teachers, to cater for children with special education needs.<br><br>
The Warnock committee made a particular study of this matter and went around the country visiting varoius
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
schools. It would be relevant if I mentioned some of the aspects in the Warnock report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I have been fairly lenient in allowing the hon. Gentleman to make references to the Warnock report, in support of the amendment, which so far have been fairly close to it. But I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not propose to divert too far from the amendments before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:No, Mr. Gourlay. I am merely referring to the words "significant expenditure being incurred" in paragraph (e). That is the main reason why I want the whole of paragraph <i>(e)</i> to be deleted. I think that the Government should be providing that significant expenditure for disabled children instead of what they propose to do in saying that this parents' charter should be torn up in the case of parents of disabled children.<br><br>
I should like to refer to some of the proposals in the Warnock report about the conversion of existing buildings to provide more mobility and educational opportunities for disabled children, such as the provision of:
<br><blockquote><p>"ramps and other aids to movement, space for a wheel-chair, special equipment such as a hearing aid, the presence of non-teaching aides, and individual teaching within the ordinary class supported where necessary by special materials, such as books with large print."</p></blockquote>
All those aids would require "significant expenditure" as proposed in paragraph (e). It is most unfair of the Government to discourage local authorities from providing such extra expenditure and to discourage parents as a result from opting to have their handicapped child integrated into an ordinary school.<br><br>
In some cases, education authorities have taken initiatives despite constraints on public expenditure. It seems in recent years that some education authorities have gone out of their way and tried to introduce pilot schemes to integrate handicapped children into ordinary schools.<br><br>
Again, the Warnock report refers to the London borough of Haringey
<br><blockquote><p>"where some deaf children are being integrated into ordinary classes in their local primary and secondary schools. Each child in the scheme receives a daily visit of up to 45 minutes from a teacher of the deaf."</p></blockquote>
That would require significant expenditure of the type that is referred to in paragraph <i>(e).</i> Also,
<br><blockquote><p>"Visits of up to five half days a week from a supporting teacher, who has undertaken a brief induction course in helping children"</p></blockquote>
deaf children that, too, would require significant expenditure. It does not matter whether it is extra material resources or extra full-time or visiting teachers, but that would require significant expenditure referred to in paragraph (e). The Warnock report also says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The amount of additional help that each child needs varies according to his age, hearing loss, personality, the size of the school class and the way the class is organised. Schemes for the integration of individual deaf children are also operating in Norfolk in Worcestershire where over 80 per cent, of the children who wear hearing aids attend local ordinary schools."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that some of us have had representations from parents of deaf and hard-of-hearing children and from voluntary organisations which look after the interests of deaf children. I am sure that such organisations would welcome any move to give more freedom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
and opportunity to parents to send their deaf or other handicapped children, if they wish, to an ordinary school so that they could be educated along with their friends. However the Government say "Oh, no. If anything in Warnock requires significant expenditure we had better not impose any legal obligation on the local education authority." In turn they would be depriving such children of equality of opportunity.<br><br>
What about premises? Apart from the provision of specialist teachers, and perhaps the conversion of toilet facilities and the provision of special space for wheelchairs, there will be other items referring to the material premises of the school which would require extra money. Paragraph 7.26 states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The nature of the school premises is a major determinant of the effectiveness of special educational provision in ordinary schools. Any impediments to easy movement around the school will need to be overcome through adaptations to premises if children with severe physical difficulties are to be enabled to join ordinary classes and share in school activities. Other more general considerations, such as the degree of open planning, may affect the suitability of a school for children with emotional disorders or with impaired hearing."</p></blockquote>
It is true that many school buildings in Scotland are still completely unsuitable for disabled children. That is a great pity, but thinking about the education of these children has changed a great deal in the last century. There are now moves towards as much integration as possible, as long as it is consistent with the educational needs of the child rather than contrary to those needs. If there is any doubt at all about the matter, parental choice should be considered.<br><br>
Many of the Scottish schools are very old indeed. I remember receiving a reply from the Under-Secretary of State in the previous Government. At that time, well over 40 per cent, of the primary schools in Scotland were still in buildings that had been built before the First World War, when there was a different attitude towards the education of disabled children. It was thought that if a child was disabled—physically, mentally, emotionally or whatever—it would be best to send him away to a special school.<br><br>
However, educational thinking has changed for the better. Even so, it is of little use to come out with pious hopes and wishes for these children unless society is prepared to put its hand into its pocket and to provide adequate back-up resources. This Government fails lamentably in that. They would have to convert all the pre-First-World-War type of buildings to improve access.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. Will he accept that many of the old parts of schools can be made much more accessible for disabled people than the new buildings which are built on four or five levels, without lifts and with narrow stairs? Those are more difficult for the disabled than old buildings which have broad stairs and broad corridors and which are not usually more than two storeys high.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is trying to score a point against the Government in respect of old schools, although it is one that could have applied when his own party were in power. But he is really banging at the wrong problem—and it is not the only problem, because buildings built even in the last year or two are probably inadequate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether an accurate survey has been conducted into whether pre-First-World-War buildings are more suitable or less suitable to adaptation. But there has been legislation throughout the 1970s which may not have been enforced as it should have been. I refer particularly to the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. I would expect that if a survey were to be carried out on buildings built since that Act was put on the statute book, it would be found that there was some provision for access for the disabled, even though it might not be ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Before the hon. Gentleman follows the red herring too far, perhaps he will come back to the amendment. We need not continue at great length about the effect of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. We must accept that it is operating as it was meant to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. But the Act is an example of a measure which puts legal obligations on authorities but which, unless those legal obligations are backed up by adequate Government resources—the type of significant expenditure referred to in paragraph <i>(e)</i>—means that none of the good intentions can be fulfilled.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The Warnock report also refers to school-based resource centres. I have already pointed out that it recommends that
<br><blockquote><p>"Where one does not already exist, some form of resource centre or other supporting base should be established in large schools to promote the effectiveness of special education provision."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 7.32 it goes on to outline the idea of a resource centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I am not prepared to have a discussion on the Warnock report. The hon. Member has made all the references relevant to the amendment, and he should draw his remarks to a conclusion. He is now developing the entire Warnock concept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:With respect, Mr. Gourlay, amendment No. 44 refers exclusively to the parents of the children with whom the Warnock report was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I know what the amendment says, and I have also read paragraph <i>(e)</i> about six times in order to try to relate the hon. Member's remarks to the amendment. He has adduced sufficient arguments to support the deletion of paragraph (e), and I am ruling that no further references to Warnock are required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Without mentioning Warnock, I would point out that it is generally considered that many of the extra aids, whether for resource centres or better access to schools, would require extra expenditure. It is, therefore, hypocritical of the Government to claim that they are improving parental choice, when this paragraph does nothing to improve freedom of choice or the opportunities of the most important group of parents—those who realise that they and their children do not have the same freedom of choice or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
equality of opportunity as the children next door. There should be a system of positive discrimination in favour of those children, but paragraph <i>(e)</i> discriminates against them.<br><br>
The parents' charter, for what it is worth, applies to well over 90 per cent, of parents, but does not apply to that important minority. The sad thing is that that 90 per cent, do not even want the charter anyway. They seem to be fairly content with their lot and reasonably happy with their present freedom of choice. The so-called parents' charter will cater for only a few disgruntled elements, but parents with genuine complaints about their children's education—particularly the parents of disabled children—will get no extension of freedom. Paragraph (?) exposes the parents' charter for the hypocritical sham that it is.<br><br>
I turn to amendment No. 45, in which I propose the addition of an extra paragraph <i>(h)</i> at the end of page 3, line 3, under which the duty imposed by subsection (1) on the education authority would not apply
<br><blockquote><p>"'if the number and nature of placing requests is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on the viability of courses and the equality of educational opportunity available for children at any school or schools under the management of the education authority'."</p></blockquote>
An education authority has an overall responsibility to try to look at all the schools under its management and to ensure that there is opportunity for the children in those schools. Any education authority would be concerned if it saw its schools being divided into first-class, second-class and third-class schools and so on, because of the imagined "betterness" of some schools in the eyes of parents, which has led them to move their children between the schools. There is a danger of an exodus from one school to another. There is, particularly in deprived areas, genuine concern that some schools may deteriorate into ghetto schools.<br><br>
I should not like to see such a thing happening, and I do not think that the councillors on education committees would either. Most important, I do not think that the majority of parents would like to see such a situation developing. But there is a distinct chance that if sizeable emigration from one school to another takes place, the school from which the children are shifted could be threatened over the viability of its courses and its class sizes. To take the argument to an extreme limit, the viability of the school as an educational unit might be seriously threatened.<br><br>
I do not think that it is preferable to look at the element of freedom of choice from the point of view of one parent, or of one small group of parents. Of course an education authority has statutory duties to the children in its area, but it ought to think of all the children in that area. The exercise of a degree of so-called freedom by one group of parents could—indirectly—lead to the denial of freedom to another group, and to a deprivation of educational opportunity to their children. That is why I say that there should be provision in the Bill for the education authority to be excused from the duties imposed by clause 1(1) if there is clear evidence that the number and nature of the placing requests is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on other children.<br><br>
I know, Mr. Gourlay, that before you came to the House you were very much concerned with education matters in Fife. I was born and brought up in Fife and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
educated there. I remember that at that time in some areas of Fife there were what were called senior secondary schools and junior secondary schools. The education authority operated an invidious selective system under which some children were sent to one type of school and others to another type of school. To my mind, that system of education was wrong, and I was very pleased when—mainly in the time of the 1964-70 Labour Government—Fife and other education authorities in Scotland took the initiative, replaced the old-style junior secondary school and tried to establish a full six-year all-through comprehensive system.<br><br>
That is not the only system. I understand that, in some areas of Fife, even at the present time, there are schools called junior high schools. From what I hear from some of the parents in those areas, they would like their children to go to senior high schools—six-year all-through schools—rather than the junior high schools.<br><br>
There tends to be, in the eyes of parents, an estimation of a school's worth. A school tends to get a reputation. It may be a good reputation or a bad reputation. A school may get a bad reputation through no fault of its own, simply because it is in a deprived area. But whether a school is in what is termed a good neighbourhood or a not such a good nieghbourhood, the Committee should be trying to ensure that children whose parents opt for them to go to the neighbourhood school are not therefore deprived in terms of choice of courses, numbers of teachers, or variety of subjects on offer.<br><br>
We do not want to return to the divisive system that existed in some areas of Scotland until the late 1960s or early 1970s, whereby families were divided by the ruth-lessness of things called qualifying examinations, and other selection tests, and children were divided into sheep and goats at the age of 11 or 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member knows, I have had some experience in education, but I wonder how closely his remarks are related to amendment No. 45.1 would have expected him to come to the point by now. I have allowed him a fairly general description of the Scottish education scene, both past and present, but I think that he has now developed that account to an extent not required by the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the point now, Mr. Gourlay, and you will be pleased to hear that it is my final point.<br><br>
I would not wish to see a return to the days of first-class and second-class schools. I think that an education authority has a duty to try to equalise educational opportunity for all the children, whatever neighbourhood they live in. If any kind of discrimination is required, it ought to be positive discrimination in favour of children from deprived areas.<br><br>
My amendment No. 45 is a very reasonable amendment. I have deliberately copied the style of the parliamentary draftsmen, and I cannot see any technical hitch, although it has not yet been cleared by the Solicitor-General for Scotland. If the Minister will accept the substance of the amendment, we may be able to tidy it up later if there is a technical hitch. I should be grateful for his views on this important matter, because he should ensure that this parents' charter will not mean a reduction of educational opportunity for any children.</span></p>

<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important debate on a number of matters relating to parental choice. Although I make no criticism of the Chair in this respect, I believe that we could have come to the heart of these matters earlier than we have.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and to the hon. Members for Stirlingshire, West (Mr. Canavan) and for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) for the points that they have raised on this group of amendments. I can only reply by going through the amendments and giving my comments.<br><br>
I start with amendment No. 9, which I believe would lead to an undesirable diminution of the strengthening of parental rights that the Bill seeks to achieve. In moving the amendment, hon. Gentlemen are providing an avenue for authorities so minded to refuse to placing requests merely because it would create a need for a few coat hooks or for other minor expenditure. This is hardly reasonable. I said all along that parental choice could not be obtained at any price, but where a parent makes a request which can be accommodated at the specified school at a reasonable cost, I hope that it can be granted and that the local education authorities will not seek to do otherwise.<br><br>
It is possible to envisage a number of situations which, if the amendment were carried, would wreck the whole purpose of the Bill, which is to extend parental choice. For example, the parent of a handicapped child may ask for the child to be admitted to an ordinary school. The only objection to admitting that child might be the need for a handrail or other item of expenditure. It can cost £100 or more even to fit handrails these days or to make an adaptation to toilet facilities. Anything of that kind might be used by a local authority as an excuse for turning down a placing request. I do not believe that anyone in the Committee would seriously argue that that should happen. Therefore, I cannot recommend my hon. Friends to accept amendment No. 9.<br><br>
Amendment No. 10 would allow an education authority to refuse a placing request where placing the child in that school would be detrimental to his education. To ensure that parents' rights are adequately protected, it is essential to provide that authorities may refuse placing requests only where it is clear that it would not be in the child's interests to accept the request. I do not accept that the wording
<br><blockquote><p>'detrimental to the... child's education"</p></blockquote>
offers sufficient protection and I strongly recommend to hon. Members that the word "seriously" be retained. I know that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) objected to the words "seriously" and "significantly". He thought that they were too vague. But the use of these expressions of degree is normal and common in statute. It enables the rules to be applied in a way that is consistent and fair in the different circumstances of different cases. Amendment No. 45, to which the hon. Member put his name, uses the word "seriously". I believe that it is necessary to resist amendment No. 10.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) wished not to press amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
ment No. 11, but did not have the same desire in regard to amendment No. 12, on the question of curriculum. It is a fact of life that falling school rolls will mean that in future it will be more difficult to offer in all schools as wide a range of courses as is now available. I trust that hon. Gentlemen recognise that it is not through some act of Government policy that school rolls are falling. It is a fact of life. However, it provides greater opportunity, in our view, for parental choice.<br><br>
On the question of class organisation, where a school is well managed, there is no reason why classes cannot be arranged in such a way as to fit in additional children. These matters can be met by the school and the school authorities dealing with them in the locality.<br><br>
The effect of amendment No. 13, to leave out "normally" from line 29, would be to allow an education authority to refuse a placing request where the education provided at the school requested by the parent was not suited to the age, ability or aptitude of the child concerned. This amends the existing wording of new section 28A, which allows the authority to refuse the request only where the education normally provided at that school is not suited to the child. Again, I think that it is a matter of leaving some flexibility to the authorities concerned. But, more importantly, the amendment would have the effect of reducing parental rights—the very thing which we are trying to enhance in the Bill.<br><br>
There will be cases where a school could with little or no difficulty accommodate, for example, a handicapped child requiring education of a kind readily adaptable to the normal provision of education at that school. If only minimal adjustments are required to the school's accommodation or facilities, I think that it is only right that the school should be required to admit the child.<br><br>
The effect of amendment No. 21, in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Argyll and for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), would be to remove from new section 28A the provision which would enable an authority to refuse a parent's placing request where this would be seriously deterimental to the continuity of the child's education. My hon. Friends may fear that this sub-paragraph might be misused by an education authority in certain circumstances to refuse a placing request on the specious argument that any change of school, apart from the normal transfer stage, would be detrimental to the continuity of the child's education. I do not think this will happen in practice, but in any event I ask my hon. Friends to note that the provision requires that the detriment must be serious. That could prevent the misuse of this reason for refusal. Secondly, even if an authority seeks to misuse the provision as it stands, it will have to justify to the appeal committee, and perhaps to the sheriff, its interpretation of the word "serious". I would prefer to leave the Bill as it stands in this regard. I hope that my hon. Friends will agree.<br><br>
Amendment No. 22 is to insert "seriously" in line 25. The effect of this amendment would be to adjust the drafting of new section 28A to allow an authority to refuse a placing request only if placing the child would be seriously detrimental to order and discipline in the school concerned. I accept the juxtaposition of the word "seriously" here; the argument about the previous amendment has some relation to this amendment. 1 think that it would be in order for me to accept amend-

ment No. 22, because I think that it would achieve the objective that we all seek—to strengthen the parental position. Therefore, I am grateful to my hon. Friends for that amendment.<br><br>
I cannot accept amendment No. 23, because it would withdraw from education authorities the power to refuse a placing request where placing the child in a school would be detrimental to
<br><blockquote><p>"the educational wellbeing of the pupils there".</p></blockquote>
In proposing the amendment the intention of my hon. Friends is again clearly to increase the likelihood that a parent's choice of school will be met by an authority, by reducing the grounds on which an authority might refuse a placing request.<br><br>
I think that my hon. Friend queried the circumstances in which damage to the educational wellbeing of other pupils might arise under the Bill as it stands. For example, there might be a handicapped child. An authority might have a policy of integration in ordinary schools but might have to say that the school that the parent wanted was already catering for a number of perhaps similarly handicapped pupils, or other types of handicapped children, and could not reasonably cope with the request. It might be argued that it would do more harm to the child's education than anything else. I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that many authorities try to avoid an undue concentration of children requiring extra attention in one school. I believe that those considerations are best dealt with in the Bill as it stands, and not along the lines that my hon. Friends suggested in the amendment.<br><br>
In amendment No. 24, my hon. Friends suggest the deletion of the words "ability or aptitude". My hon. Friend asked whether, in view of comprehensive education, it was necessary or desirable to include those words. There is a connection between this amendment and amendment No. 44, in the name the of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire. Although it may surprise my hon. Friends that there is a connection.<br><br>
It is difficult to delete those words, given the requirements in the 1980 Act, which relates to the parents' duty to provide education suitable to a child's age, ability and aptitude. The definition of school education also refers to that. One specific example that could arise would be a parent who sought a place for his child in the special music unit now provided by Strathclyde and Lothian regions. This provision would enable an authority to refuse a place if a child failed the audition. There are parents who have an understandably exaggerated view of their children's gifts. I think that that would arise in the case of musical aptitude.<br><br>
I come to the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire and amendment No. 43, which seeks to leave out "continuity of the". That would enable an education authority to refuse a placing request if it considered that it would be seriously detrimental to a child's education generally rather than to the continuity of that education as provided by the Bill.<br><br>
It is difficult to see what purpose the amendment would serve. We feel that it is important that the granting of placing requests should not result in a serious break in the continuity of the child's education, and we have made that a legitimate ground for refusing a placing request. It is difficult to see how a placing could be detrimental to a child's education generally<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
in a way not covered in paragraph (c)—that is what the amendment suggests—unless the hon. Gentleman feels that the education provided at some schools is so inadequate that children should not be sent there and that that would be recognised by the authority when refusing the request.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman's other remarks suggest that he takes the opposite view and believes that all schools are equal and that one school is as good as another. I find it impossible to accept that argument, but it would, in any case, contradict the points he made in amendment No. 43.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman drew our attention in amendment No. 44 to the whole of paragraph <i>(e).</i> The amendment would remove one of the grounds on which an education authority can refuse a placing request— namely that meeting the request would involve the authority in "significant expenditure" because of a child's "special educational needs". I have been looking at this part of the Bill and how it relates to subsection (3). I think that the hon. Gentleman has a point, because the meaning of "significant" in subsection (3)(6)(ii)—we were anxious to retain the word there-appears to contradict its use in paragraph <i>(e).</i> It also seems to restrict choice unnecessarily.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment and highlighting the significance of paragraph (e). Furthermore when he concentrates on the facts of the matter and does not allow his imagination to fly in directions that might be better described by the tie he is wearing, he can make a far more significant contribution to the Committee and to the passage of the Bill, and he has done so this evening.<br><br>
There are consequential amendments, and it will be necessary to consider those. We are willing to consider the matter, and if the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment I assure him that we shall take action along the lines he has suggested—namely, to delete paragraph (e) and to make the consequential amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:In the event of the amendments being withdrawn, I assume that we shall return to the matter on Report, and that time will be given for adequate discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:In fact, it is not necessary to withdraw the amendment; it simply will not be called.<br><br>
I come now to amendment No. 45. I hate to spoil a promising new relationship with the hon. Gentleman, but not only do I find it necessary to request the Committee to resist this amendment, but I can describe it only as a wrecking amendment. The hon. Gentleman must have tabled it during one of his flights of fancy, when he was not concentrating on the facts that I have previously described.<br><br>
Amendment No. 50 would remove from the list of specified grounds on which an education authority can refuse a placing request the ground that the school is a special school and that
<br><blockquote><p>"the child does not have special educational needs requiring the education or special facilities"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay, may I

return to the point of order that I made earlier? The Minister is speaking here at the same time as he is expected to be replying to a debate on the Floor of the House. Would it not be better if we were to adjourn now and allow the Minister the opportunity to reply to that debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is not a point of order. The Minister should continue. I shall be suspending the sitting shortly in any event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Surely it is unprecedented for a Minister of the Crown not to be on the Floor of the House when he is due to reply to a debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. It is a matter for the Government, and not for the Chair, to decide who is to reply to a debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for that ruling.<br><br>
I return to amendment No. 50. This ground for refusal of a pressing request is to some extent the converse of the ground expressed in paragraph <i>(e).</i> Bearing in mind that an education authority is not obliged to turn down a pressing request even if one or more of the specified grounds does exist, it is reasonable to provide that an authority can argue that a special school is not the right placing for an unhandicapped child, just as an ordinary school may not be the correct placing for a handicapped child. On those simple and straightforward grounds I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.<br><br>
I come now to the last amendment in this group, amendment No. 51. I hope that hon. Members will consider that this amendment, too, is unacceptable, because paragraph (g) of the new section 28A(3) disapplies the duty on an education authority to comply with a placing request where the school specified by the parent
<br><blockquote><p>"is a single sex school … and the child is not of the sex admitted …to the school."</p></blockquote>
The effect of amendment No. 51 would be to remove that provision and to require authorities to place a child in a specified school which is a single-sex school, even where the child is not of the sex normally admitted to the school. That is something of a nonsense; it might be great fun for the youngsters involved, but I think that the Bill was not intended to be applied in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Can the Minister tell us how many schools are likely to be affected? How many single-sex schools operated by local authorities are there in Scotland? If there are none, the amendment is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not believe that there are many— if any—schools of the kind referred to by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Surely the Minister can justify his argument, and the legilastion, with figures. There are only nine regional authorities and three islands authorities operating as education authorities. Surely from those 12 bodies there is information available to us on how many single-sex schools they operate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Ther are 10 such schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Will the Minister tell us which authorities they come under, and the number of pupils concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The schools include St Andrew's high school, Notre Dame girls' school and St Patrick's boys' school, Our Lady and St Francis, St Mungo's, Notre Dame, Garnethill convent, and a boys' school in Paisley. In adition, there are two special schools.<br><br>
It may be as much of a surprise to the hon. Gentleman as it is to me that there are schools of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend as surprised as I am that Opposition Members have to ask for the names of these important, principally Roman Catholic religious establishments, which are well known to all who have an interest in the quality of education in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), I am not a Roman Catholic. So far as denominational schools are concerned this adds a further point. What possibility is there of non-Catholics being allowed to attend these schools? The Minister may want to consider that as a possible further amendment, now that we know that paragraph <i>(g)</i> deals most exclusively with denominational schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That does not arise at all, because the question of denomination or discrimination on religious grounds would not be placed in any part of the Bill. It is clearly a matter for the authorities running the schools. The question of single sex schools is quite different from the question of denominational schools. I am sure that there are cases of non-Roman Catholics being admitted to Roman Catholic schools, and there are certainly cases of Roman Catholics being admitted to non-Roman Catholic schools—and long may it continue.<br><br>
In the time available, I have dealt with this important group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>(Dundee, East): The Minister dealt cursorily with amendment No. 45 and said that it was a wrecking amendment. Is that correct? The Minister should turn his attention to the text of the amendment, which says
<br><blockquote><p>"if the number and nature of placing requests is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on the viability of courses".</p></blockquote>
I would have taken the point and the remarks by the Minister if the word "seriously" had not been included, because obviously it would have been a complete torpedo-like objection to any placements. But where there is the word "seriously", does it not suggest that the Minister should give a reasoned answer as to why the amendment is not acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Yes, indeed. I shall reply to that. It could make the Bill unworkable, because before an authority could deal with a placing request, under the terms of the amendment it would have to consider how the request would affect the totality of the education service it provided. Even where this might be practicable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
—and there must be some doubt about that—the delay in processing an individual request and the cost to the authority in staff time would be considerable, and in large education authorities the task would be impossible.<br><br>
It is because the amendment as tabled would require such a comprehensive review of the effect—not just on the receiving school, but on other schools in the area— that we feel that it would be unwise to accept it. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that I dismissed it as a wrecking amendement, but I did so because it can be interpreted, in my view, as requiring the authority to look at the strength of all the education provided in the area, and that is evidently impracticable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation. There is nothing in the amendment to suggest that the education authority must conduct a review of the nature suggested by the Minister. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the number and nature of placing requests is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect".</p></blockquote>
Combined with the words "likely" and "seriously", I would suggest to the Minister that the emphasis differs from what he has said. There is obviously no obligation here on any local education authority to conduct a complete review in relation to any placement. But where there is a seriously detrimental effect one would expect it to be known to the local authority without a detailed review. Indeed, the word "likely" is probably the key word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I understand the point that the hon Gentleman is making, but he stopped short in reading the amendment. It goes on to refer to
<br><blockquote><p>"the viability of courses and the equality of educational opportunity available for children at any school or schools under the management of the education authority".</p></blockquote>
In speaking to the amendment, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire returned to a point which we hear frequently from the Opposition—which is, simply, that if some parents are able to have their request granted, others may not. One reason may be that they do not make the effort to choose a school for their children.<br><br>
The argument from the Opposition Benches suggests that because some parents take the interest and the initiative and are successful in getting their children into their chosen school—I agree that there is an element of good fortune, and still will be, even after the Bill is enacted, because success depends on the circumstances of the school—others may not be successful and therefore no one should have the opportunity. It is because of such thinking, which was evident when the amendment was moved, that I reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words on my amendment No. 44. However, he did not make it clear what kind of concession he was offering. Is he simply thinking of the change in the legislative framework in order not to relieve local authorities of their responsibilities to handicapped children, or will he back up the statutory responsibility of local authorities by giving them more resources so that parents can exercise a freedom of choice? In other words, will the freedom of choice be real or will it be a myth?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
Unless the Minister gives more money, whether by way of capital allocation or increased rate support grant, or both, to local authorities, many will find it difficult to accommodate handicapped children whose parents want them to go to an ordinary school. Therefore, I hope that when the Minister considers the concession, he will bear in mind that we want not only a legislative framework but more resources. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Two points arise. First, we require the legislative framework and I agree that we also require the resources. But that is a matter of priorities. The resources are tightly constrained at present for reasons which I am sure, Mr. Gourlay, you would not wish me to enter into now. But it will take some time to implement fully the legislative provisions of Warnock. During this period we hope that the Government's economic policies will result in more resources gradually becoming available. But there is nothing wrong with providing the legislative framework in readiness for those extra resources that we hope will become available.<br><br>
On the specific point of the amendment, we accept the hon. Gentleman's advice and we wish to delete paragraph (e) on page 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Does that mean that the Minister accepts the amendment or that he will introduce his own amendment on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We shall wait until Report to do that because there are consequential amendments to this in other parts of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Before I call the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), perhaps I may say that I intended to suspend the Committee. I do not know how long the hon. Member wishes to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It will be a relatively short speech. I rise to give notice of our intention not to press amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 to a vote, but we should be grateful for the opportunity to vote on amendments Nos. 12 and 45.<br><br>
However, we want to put it on record that the reason for our attempt to remove adjectives and adverbs from some of the subsections is not to circumscribe parental rights of choice and freedom, but to remove from the legislation a series of pitfalls which we think will result in court actions where authorities choose to seek clarification of the meaning of the word "significant" in relation to expenditure. We feel that the Minister's references to coat hooks, and so on, are trivial, and that it would not be beyond the wit and intelligence of financial controllers in any large authority to bury expenditure within particular areas if they saw fit. We feel that when millions of pounds are involved—even allowing for the parsimoney with which the Government make available the rate support grant, as well as the fact that large authorities still have the opportunity to spend some of that money—it may be necessary for the courts to define those words if they are in the Bill.<br><br>
The Opposition seek consistency, and we should like to remove from everyone the need to appeal to the courts as often as possible. We should like these matters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
to be dealt with internally, in a way whereby Ministers would be able to specify clearly what they consider to be tolerable levels of expenditure, and so on. Therefore, we should prefer the words "significant" and "seriously" to be withdrawn. We recognise that the Minister will not concede our case, though we are grateful for his minor conversion and hope that he will once again walk down that road. We also point out that we have already given notice of our intention to withdraw amendments Nos. 50 and 51, to which he replied at considerable length.<br><br>
We do not accept the Minister's arguments. We think that he may be creating conditions for a sizeable amount of litigation to ensue. We realise that many Conservative Members will benefit from that, and we do not wish to deny them their crust after the next election. I am sure that they will continue to hold their seats, although they may have to work in the Scottish courts. Nevertheless, we feel that it would be much easier if our legislation did not make people run to the courts for clarification of matters of the sort to which I have referred.<br><br>
We shall not press amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11, together with amendments Nos. 50 and 51, but we wish to vote on amendments. Nos. 12 and 45. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 3, line 7, after "inform", insert "within 28 days".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 57, in page 3, line 17, after "decision", insert "within 28 days".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We feel that it would be appropriate to require local authorities to inform the parents of their decisions within a stipulated period. We know that some local authorities have a cycle of meetings that take longer than 28 days, but we feel that we should set a time limit on the local authority.<br><br>
It has sometimes been alleged—the allegations have often been unfounded—that local authorities treat people who make placing requests with a lack of consideration. We feel that to set a time limit will be in keeping with that part of the Bill that is seeking to give parents a reasonable deal. In amendment No. 57 we are asking for the same consideration.<br><br>
The amendment is fairly straightforward. I should like to hear whether the Minister has any objections to it, because it seems perfectly reasonable to us and it will not undermine the Bill in any way. At present the Bill does not insist that the local authority has to notify the parents within any stipulated period.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). Twenty-eight days seems a reasonable length of time within which an education authority should give a reply to the parents.<br><br>
One interesting effect of the amendment has been to draw attention to the strange nature of subsection (5) of new section 28A, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, by regulations, make provision for deeming an education authority to have refused a placing request in the event of their not having informed the parent in writing of their decision".</p></blockquote>
That provision is remarkable. It seems to provide for a situation where an education authority does not carry out the obligation placed upon it by statute, in which case it has to be deemed to have refused a position.<br><br>
I think that it would be wrong for an education authority or the parents to be placed in that situation. There should be placed upon the education authority a statutory obligation to inform the parents in writing of its decision. That is provided for in subsection (4). Provided that the 28 days' amendment is made, the authority would have a timescale in which to carry out that obligation.<br><br>
The method by which the Secretary of State is requested to deal with a recalcitrant education authority is rather ham-fisted. Subsection (5) states
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, by regulations, make provision for deeming".</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand why those regulations are demanded in the first place. An obligation should be placed upon an education authority to inform a parent within a given time, as suggested by the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire. If 28 days is considered too short a period, the Minister should say so and another period might be put down—perhaps five or six weeks.<br><br>
It seems strange that the Secretary of State and the SED must go to all the trouble of producing regulations to deal with an education authority in breach of a statutory obligation. The Minister should simplify the legislation, and if he accepts the 28-day time for subsection (4) he might find that subsection (5) is unnecessary. It seems to be a roundabout way for the Government to bring pressure to bear upon a local authority.<br><br>
I should have thought that the placing of a time limit on education authorities, whatever period it might be, was the most effective and simplest way of taking care of a recalcitrant education authority, although I doubt whether any education authority would not carry out its obligations. If it did not it would be subject not only to the possibility of legal action for enforcement, but of being taken to the local authority Commissioner for Administration. It would also inherit a fair degree of opprobrium from the press, parents and others for failing to carry out its part of the parents' charter.<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that he should accept amendment No. 53, but consider dropping subsection (5) because it is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Committee will notice that because of the brilliant way in which I made that long speech on a Government amendment recently my hon. Friend has risked my rising to my feet twice, although the substance of the clause is basically his and I have other responsibilities in Scotland. However, I congratu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
late the hon. Members for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) on the moderate and generous way in which they have spoken to the amendment. For that I am grateful. My hon. Friend and I do not basically quarrel with the Opposition's desire to ensure that parents are informed of a decision on any placing within a reasonable period, but if the hon. Gentlemen consider the practical problems they will realise that 28 days may be too short a period in many cases, and may lead to injustice to some parents.<br><br>
Authorities will be faced with a considerable task each year in dealing with placing requests for children due to start primary school or transfer to secondary school in August. My hon. Friend's consultative paper on information for parents, which is available to the Committee today, suggests that authorities should be required to tell the parents of these children of their right to make a placing request at least six months before the child is due to start school—that is, normally by mid-February. The consultative paper also suggests that parents should be given at least four weeks in which to decide whether they want to make a placing request.<br><br>
8.45 p.m.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment will be that the parent who has made up his mind in advance and who makes his placing request immediately will be entitled to a decision before the parent who wants to give the matter more thought, perhaps to visit some schools and to collect information about them, has even made his request. That would clearly be unjust. Authorities must be given time to collect all the requests and, where a school is over-subscribed, to weigh them up carefully and decide which pupils should be given priority in the light of their guidelines for admission. It would be fairer to all parents concerned to set authorities a deadline that is not dependent upon the point at which the parent made the request, but is related instead to the point at which the parent needs to know where his child is going in August.<br><br>
I refer particularly to the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I commend him on his constant attendance in this Committee, whereas Labour Members are more conspicuous by their absence or presence. The point that he was making is covered by the fact that, for example, a regulation made under subsection (5) of new section 28A might reasonably say that if a parent has not had a decision by early May the request should be deemed to be refused, so the parent may proceed to appeal if he wishes.<br><br>
I have talked so far of the normal case. In other cases, for instance where a parent moves to an area in the middle of a school year and wants a place for his child straight away, a 28-day time limit may be reasonable.<br><br>
I hope that I have said enough. However, to demonstrate that complexities of this kind are best left to be dealt with in the regulations I ask the hon. Gentlemen not to press the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That Minister has taken our point. There can be circumstances in which the provisions laid down under the proposals do not apply. It may not be a new session when people want to make changes. I accept the point about 28 days not being

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
adequate, or perhaps being too long, but it is incumbent upon the Minister to stipulate some period.<br><br>
We are happy to withdraw the amendment, but we should like to think that before Report the Government will look again at this whole question and introduce an amendment that will in our estimation, stiffen this matter up, as it probably is the most crucial point. We are happy to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that the Government have accepted the first of our arguments, but at the same time are perhaps willing to reconsider the matter and find some form of words on Report to take account of the views expressed by Labour Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is a perfectly reasonable point. I have had discussions with my hon. Friend on this part of the Bill and we shall certainly examine this again and see what we can do on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the selection list was printed before the amendments appeared in the Amendment Paper,, the next amendment that we are to consider is No. 58</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. This is very confusing, because, according to the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments, amendment No. 55 was due to be taken before amendment No. 58. That seems to have been changed, but we have not been informed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I can understand the hon. Gentleman's confusion, but in endeavouring to be as helpful as possible the Chair made the selection before seeing the printed amendment Paper this morning. As the printers have printed the amendments in a different order from that in which I had provisionally selected them, I have to call them in the order in which they appear on the Amendment Paper. I may have been remiss in not informing the Committee of the change earlier and I apologise for that, but we have to work according to the Amendment Paper, which puts amendment No. 58 first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. To make matters even more confusing, we have already discussed amendment No. 58 with amendment Nos. 53 and 57. Whatever else may be said in relation to the amendment, it will have been debated already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I merely make the point that we tabled amendment No. 58 on the understanding that if we did not win on amendments No. 53 or 57 we would be able to have another go. The Minister's concession will enable us not to proceed with the amendment, because he has taken the point and we do not need to press the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:For the purpose of the record I must tell the Committee that amendment No. 58 was not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
debated with amendment Nos. 53 and 57, but it is not now being moved, so we can move to amendment No. 55.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 3, line 13, after "State", insert:—
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the education authorities".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is adequate consultation with those concerned. We shall probably return to this later.<br><br>
Many aspects of the Bill give cause for concern, but one of the greatest causes for concern in the absolute power to formulate regulations which the Bill appears to grant to the Secretary of State. As legislators, I do not think that we should allow the Secretary of State to get away with that, without telling us how he will make up the regulations. Obviously they will have a considerable effect upon local education authorities, and it is only fair that they should be included in the consultative process before the regulations are finalised.<br><br>
Some of my hon. Friends and I have already had consultations with local government representatives, and some have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with many aspects of the Bill—particularly with the so-called parents' charter. The local education authorities will have the increased burden of administering the scheme laid down in clause 1.<br><br>
I think that it is only fair that we, as parliamentarians, and, more importantly, local authority representatives, should be consulted about the form that the regulations will take. Will they take the form of a statutory instrument, secondary legislation or regulations that will be sent to the local authorites by way of a circular? Will there be consultations either with the individual authorities or with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities? It is very important that such consultation takes place. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is statutory provision for such consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The regulations will be made by statutory instruments—to answer the hon. Gentleman's last point in moving the amendment. The amendment suggests that it is no part of the Government's normal practice to have consultation on legislation with education authorities and all the other bodies interested in legislation of this kind before it is put into final shape. It also suggests that consultations are necessary only with education authorities. I have said that we consult many other bodies. For example, at the time of the consultative paper on admission to schools, which was issued in February 1980, I had discussions with many bodies about what we had in mind, and comments were invited on the paper. Since publication of the Bill in December I have continued to have full discussions with every body seriously concerned with this legisation. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary to require the Government to have consultation. It is something that we do in the normal course of our work, particularly, as the hon. Gentleman will know, with the local authorities and with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities education committee. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that it is very much part of the Government process in Scotland. One reason why we did not rush into the Bill after the election was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0127">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
that a number of important matters required consultation, as we now see in the Bill. This is part of the procedure that will continue. When regulations are made under the Bill, the necessary consultations will be carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how the Minister has the brass neck to give us these assurances about consultations and expect us to believe them—particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and myself—and to claim that all is well in the consultative process which the Minister has with education authorities and various other people interested in education.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that just over a year ago he gave a firm promise to myself and my hon. Friends the Members for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire and for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that there would be consultations with the college of education authorities before any restructuring of the college system was decided. The Minister broke that promise. There were no consultations and no consultative document. Therefore, I do not see how on earth we can simply take his word for it that there will be consultations anyway even if no statutory provision is made for them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
I put the credibility of this Minister at an all-time low and I insist on a vote on the amendment so that we have statutory provision for consultation rather than the steamroller kind of decision-making which the Minister has been used to in the past.</span></p>
