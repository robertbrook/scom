I extend my apologies to him for his inadvertent exclusion from the Committee this morning.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I resume my speech about the amendments with which we were dealing this morning, I, too, welcome to the Committee the hon Member for South Ayrshire, who has a long and varied experience in education. Some of us have suffered, or rather benefited, from his influence in eastern Scotland. That was why, regardless of politics, we were able to celebrate his successful move to the west. Everyone on the Committee knows that the hon Gentleman has a great interest in our subject, and we shall look forward with interest to hearing what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to express our regret at the absence of the hon Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). We understand that he is rather unwell following his visit to South America, and has had to leave the Committee as a result. The Committee will join me, 1 am sure, in wishing him a quick return to health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I share his sadness that the reason for my joining the Committee should be the illness of my hon Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth. I thank you, too, Mr. Hunt, for your apology. I entirely understand the mistake that took place. I also thank the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) for the apology that 1 am sure he would wish to make to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 133, in page 28, line 25, leave out subsection (8).</p>
	<p>No. 135, in page 30, line 34, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"(5A) The Secretary of State shall exercise his power to make regulations under this section so as to ensure that in relation to a pupil who is required to live away from home in order to attend a local authority school and who is accepted as a pupil at a school under section 75A(1) of this Act the education authority shall pay boarding fees equivalent to those which would be incurred by that pupil's attendance at the local authority school."</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned this morning I was discussing amendment No. 132, which would limit the payment of entrance fees for public examinations entered by an assisted pupil to those for examinations "for which, in the opinion of the pupil's parents, he should be presented."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the discussion we have been comparing the State sector—the public sector, as we more sensibly call it in Scotland—with the private sector—once again, the Scottish term is more sensible. The Government have tried to even out the regulations relating to either sector or both sectors. That is also our view on presentation for examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that in both the public and the private sector that is a matter not for legislation but for school management—for the schools and the parents. In most schools it is normal practice for consultations to take place between the school and the parents about the subjects and grades of examinations for which children are presented. The Bill leaves such matters in those hands, and we believe that they should remain there. T cannot therefore recommend the Committee to accept amendment No. 132.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already intervened on the subject of amendment No. 133, during the speech of the hon Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey). The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's power to pay assisted places grant on the basis of a notional fee that he considers appropriate if the participating school proposes to charge an excessive fee in respect of an assisted pupil. As I told the hon Member for Kilmarnock this morning, we expect fees charged by schools in the scheme to be acceptable in terms of the assisted places scheme. However, we must make provision for cases in which we think that the fees charged by a school are, for whatever reason, excessive. Subsection (8) enables us, when the Secretary of State believes the fee to be excessive, to establish a notional fee in respect of the parental contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give the Committee an idea of what he considers excessive? To give an example, I know of two schools that are close to each other—my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was once associated with one—in which there is a great difference in the fees charged. George Heriot school, has at the top range, a day-only fee of £306 per term, whereas Fettes college has a day-only termly fee of £750. That is a great difference. It means that the boys who attend Fettes are gaining a considerable advantage from the assisted-places scheme over those who attend George Heriot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a case, does the Minister consider that the Fettes fees are excessive and might he therefore apply
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
a notional fee of something approaching the figure for George Heriot school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that when the hon Gentleman referred to the benefit that might accrue from going to Fettes as distinct from George Heriot's, he meant the apparent financial benefit, not the quality of education. No doubt, the hon Gentleman is aware that George Heriot's has been a grant-aided school for many years, and therefore the fees are lower than those of an independent school simply because it is in the grant-aided scheme and receiving block grant from the Government. That affects the current fees of a number of schools, and will affect them to a decreasing extent over the five years that it will take to withdraw the block grant scheme and introduce the assisted-places scheme, as the hon Gentleman is, no doubt, aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not wish to say at this point what I consider an excessive amount because it depends on what one is comparing the fees with. If the only two amounts of fees we were considering were about £300 and £700 a term, there would be cause to look at the situation. But as we are talking of more than 40 schools, I would wish to know what the average fee was for those and compare it with a fee that was considerably in excess of the average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have not checked this, but it appears from a quick look through the figures that the day schools—the legitimate day schools that have no boarding, or a very small boarding section—have considerably lower day fees than boarding schools. So there are marked differences there. Would the Minister be looking at normal day school figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the normal day school figure. Reference was made to it this morning. We should consider how the fee is made up. I imagine that a day school may automatically include meals in the fee basis. The method of allowing for meals to be paid from within the assisted places scheme, as the hon Gentleman will see in the regulations, is based broadly on the way in which the cost of meals is met by the public purse in the State sector of education Therefore, as the scheme has its own provision for meals, we would exclude the meals content of the fee at Fettes and apply our own rules as regards meals and clothing and the other extra items that we have already considered in the Committee. That would in itself have quite an impact on any comparison of fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Can the Minister explain this? I have before me the bids for fee remission grant, which is the financial statement that the Secretary of State released in respect of the amount of money available for various schools. I shall take the case of George Heriot's, which my hon Friend raised. It made a bid, which I assume was accepted, of £47,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister prepared to tell us what will happen to the phased-out grant? Will it be aggregated with the £47,000 which is being put into the school, to compensate for the necessary increase in fees that will result from the phasing out of the grant under the present arrangements? Will that result in greater
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>584</span>
expenditure by the SED on the provision of places, and to what extent will such expenditure have to reach a level where it becomes excessive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is looking at a different aspect of the financial arrangements. He is not considering amendment No. 133, which concerns the Secretary of State's power in subsection (8). To answer the hon Gentleman's point now, with regard to the total financing of the school, the school is free to use the proportion of block grant that it will receive over the period of reduction of block grant for assisted places. Although the schools are entitled to use the block grant remainder in whichever way they have been using it over the years, we have encouraged them to apply that also in the form of assisted places—this is a distinction from the English system—so that children already at the school who would qualify by reason of income levels may have more benefit from the funds than a rather thin spread, as it must now be, of fee remission for the school as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is a matter which the schools themselves have to consider, and the indications that we have so far are that the schools are anxious to take that route, so that they are taking the total expenditure block grant and assisted-places scheme funds towards the assisted places in the school and, thereafter, if any funds are left from the block grant, they will dispose of them as they would do normally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair to add that many schools have been operating what could be called an assisted-places scheme anyway. They have always used the block grant to help lower-income families. We are legislating in the Bill to ensure that all the funds provided by the Exchequer are made available to low-income families as part of the assisted-places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 135, which was spoken to by my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and is supported by my hon Friends the Members for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and Galloway (Mr. Lang). I did not hear all of my hon Friend's remarks, for reasons with which I think he may be reasonably satisfied. I well understand, however, the reasons that he has given for supporting the amendment. It is an important amendment and 1 understand precisely what my hon Friend has in mind, if only because I did hear that part of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to be helpful in this regard. I can assure my hon Friends that nothing in the Bill prevents a local authority from taking the steps that the amendment recommends, namely, to contribute to the boarding fees of a child in its area going to one of the boarding schools in the assisted-places scheme as an option to that child going to a hostel run by the local authority for children who, by the nature of the part of the country where they live and the distance from school, are obliged to live away from home in any case. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have the power to do what the amendment suggests. I hope that they will feel that they can contribute and should do so when it is appropriate for a child to attend such a school. There is nothing to stop them. We have already rehearsed circumstances— as my hon Friend did extremely well—including those of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
a denominational kind, when it might be more convenient for a family to take advantage of the scheme and the boarding facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not placed a duty on the local authority in respect of the assisted-places scheme. The local authority is free from any involvement in that scheme. The relationship is a direct one between the parents and the schools. I hope that my hon Friends will accept this as holding out prospects for the future. Local authorities can meet the requirement, and I should certainly encourage them so to do. However, I do not wish, as the amendment seeks, to place a duty on them. That is in accordance with the general principle applying to the assisted-places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Minister's points are valid. Just for once I agree with his response to the amendment tabled by his hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). That is our view. No obligation should be placed on a local authority to provide money for any school under the scheme. A local authority's money should not be spent on that. Even if the amendment were accepted, we should not accept that a local authority should be obliged to provide that money—I wish that the Minister had made that point—when it has no say whatever on whether a child should attend such a school. That is what we find objectionable in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) might, with his usual courage, force the amendment to a vote against the wishes of his Front Bench. If so, I assure him that I should vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should abstain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend says that he would abstain. But I should vote against the amendment. It is objectionable as regards local government powers in Scotland. It tries to force a duty on to local authorites. Therefore, I should have grave reservations about simply abstaining. Certainly, as the present membership stands on the Government side, they might be in some danger of winning it. We might have to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Argyll claimed that by tabling the amendments, we gave massive support to the scheme. We are not giving support. They are probing amendments. The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) made noises to the effect that boarding fees should have been included. We thought that the amendments might give him the opportunity to show his support or at least make a speech. He has not managed to do that so far in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were carried, the Minister— knowing the enormous opposition in Scotland to the assisted-places scheme—would find it politically extremely embarrassing to increase the amount of money that he intended to spend. If boarding fees and other fees were included, the number of children who would benefit would be rapidly decreased—probably more than halved. Therefore the hon Member for Argyll is wrong in his implication about our amendments, which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
I believe my hon Friend will tell the Committee that we shall withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the light of the lengthy debate that we had on a similar set of amendments, I move the amendment only formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 28, line 32, leave out "or other matters".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 137, in page 29, leave out lines 4 and 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 138, in page 29, line 5, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>'(f) the publications of annual reports by each participating school giving details of all relevant academic information'.</p></q>
The amendments have two purposes. We want to know what "other matters" are in respect of what the Secretary of State will prescribe by regulation. The Secretary of State is being given rather vague powers. As they will be subject to statutory instrument procedure, it is important that we have an early indication about the requirements concerning
	<br><q><p>"age, residence or other matters".</p></q>
We shall be interested to hear about other conditions of eligibility for an assisted place. We have repeatedly pointed out that the Minister has been extremely vague about how pupils will be assessed for their fitness to participate in the scheme. All we have been given is the tautological assertion that bright children are those who are bright enough to benefit from the scheme. We find that confusing, and we return to the matter again because we regard this as a most unsatisfactory way of setting up a completely new structure in our education system, which could have the effect of creaming off brighter children. We want the Minister to be more specific about what the "other matters" are. We do not ask him today to rewrite the legislation. We hope that he will make it more explicit by amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9)(e), is similarly vague. The Secretary of State shall by regulations prescribe
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as appear to him to be requisite for the purposes of the scheme".</p></q>
We want the Minister to be more specific about what the Secretary of State would wish to prescribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By amendment No. 138, we seek to add a sixth paragraph to subsection (9) to provide for
	<br><q><p>"the publications of annual reports by each participating school giving details of all relevant academic information."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>587</span>
It is not only a matter of the conditions to be complied with by participating schools in respect of admission of pupils, fees and so on and the auditing and keeping of accounts; there ought to be an academic report. The Minister has already said that he regards two schools—which he has not seen fit to name—as being unfit educationally to participate in the scheme. We should like a clear indication of the academic and educational achievements and activities of the school to be published. We do so in the light of remarks made in our discussions on an earlier part of the Bill about examination results and the like which are to be produced in respect of local authority schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not like this scheme. We are not happy that examination results should be regarded as the criterion for the success or otherwise of a school. We feel that some kind of academic report—we are not being too specific—should be published annually by the schools so that the public at large may know how their money is being spent on this assisted places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking for the academic performance of each individual student—indeed, we are not being so specific as to say that examination results alone should be provided—but we think that within the regulations there should be a clear and specific responsibility on the Secretary of State to require the participating schools to let the community know—especially those who take an interest in education—the relevant academic information upon which judgments as to the fitness of these institutions can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek from the Minister a clearer expression of the meaning of "other matters" in paragraph (e)—what "other matters" appear to him to be requisite for the purpose of the scheme—and, in the additional paragraph (f), we should like him to have a responsibility to publish annual reports of participating schools, giving details of the relevant academic information so that the public at large may understand how the scheme works and decide on the acceptability of the performance of schools by whatever criteria are subsequently arrived at in consultation between the schools and the Minister concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) raises matters of importance, but the amendment would clutter up the Bill with unnecessary details. Important as the details are, they are much better set out in the regulations, and hon Gentlemen know that we are now consulting on the draft regulations for the assisted-places scheme. The items that the hon Gentleman mentions—age, nationality and the other important requirements that are important for a school to assess whether a child is able to submit for an assisted place—are all part of the consultations on the draft regulations currently taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer two points? What exactly does he mean by nationality, and could he specify with whom the consultations are taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultations are taking place with the schools and the educational bodies which are sufficiently interested in the scheme to wish to take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
part in the consultations. In particular, we have consulted with COSLA on the matter of the assisted places scheme, just as we have consulted with that body on all matters relating to the Bill.

Nationality means British and EEC as regards the scheme, in accordance with EEC regulations. As the hon Gentleman will be aware, that is a prerequisite of any legislation of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the regulations would be drawn up and that consultations were taking place. I presume that at this stage he must have some idea of the main points to be comprised under "other matters". Does that refer to intelligence tests of one kind or another? Could he give the Committee an approximate idea of, say, four or five of the other main matters including the admission arrangements, that may appear in the regulations but which he does not wish to be contained in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the question of admission arrangements. The information that we are consulting on is contained in the draft regulations which are available to the Committee. The hon Gentleman will see there the sort of items that we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards admission arrangements, which the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire has mentioned on several occasions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never answered, though.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman continues to say that and suggests that there is shyness on my part in regard to discussing admission arrangements. The matter is simple. The admission arrangements are entirely a matter for the schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member says "Rubbish", which, I hope, is not the level of intellectual contribution that he will continue to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter for the schools which are admitting children—most of them have been doing so for many years—against their own established criteria. We have never suggested that the purpose of the assisted-places scheme was to tell schools how they should go about their admission procedures, or to set up separate admission procedures as regards assisted-places pupils. I hope that no member of the Committee would suggest that we should do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is being naive or disingenuous if he is suggesting that any other criterion was applied in fee-paying schools than the ability, in the first instance, of the parents to pay the fees; thereafter, all other considerations are secondary. If they have the money, they have a good chance of getting a child in; if they do not have the money, it is very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of youngsters admitted under bursary and foundation schemes are very few, as the Minister has conceded. The other day we looked through the register of the scholarship arrangements and saw that there were precious few schools in Scotland which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>589</span>
operated some sort of system of competitive examination. Those which did are the ones that concern us, and we want to be clear as to how more people will be allowed through. However, in regard to fee-paying schools, the ability to pay fees was the first and, in some instances, the only criterion that applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not think that all the time we have discussed this matter I have ever been more grateful to the hon Gentleman than for the two points he has just made. First, he says that most of the schools do not wish entry or admission through competitive examination. For those who take a more relaxed view of entry requirements, as we do on this side of the Committee, that is welcome confirmation of the broadening of attitudes that has taken place in education over the years. 1 believe that that is one of the most important remarks that the hon Gentleman has made in discussing assisted places. Here are schools which are not looking at academic competitiveness in accepting pupils. All they are doing, says the hon. Gentleman, is measuring the ability of parents to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of the assisted-places scheme is to equalise and make it a much fairer business for children going into private education, since quite simply, there will not be the same financial impediment for lower-income families to apply for places in a school of that sort. If their children should qualify for a place, they will not be prevented by low income from taking up that place. I believe that that is good news. We have understood it all along. That has been the motivation behind the assisted-places scheme right from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have achieved nothing else in the debate, we have the approval of the hon Gentleman who leads for the Opposition in the Committee, because these are the two matters of greatest importance to him and to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman chided me—I do not object to that—about the definition relating to admission arrangements and the sort of children to whom we refer. As I said earlier, we are referring to children who will be able to benefit from the education provided by the schools. In our opinion, that again should be the sole criterion. There are many different sorts of schools. The great thing about the private sector of education in Scotland is that no one pretends that every school is the same, that the standards of every school are equal or that the syllabus or regime of discipline is the same in schools A, B, C and so on throughout Scotland. It is the variety of those schools and their activities, including their academic syllabuses, that make them attractive to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making a great attempt to remove the financial impediment for parents to take up places in those schools and we are able to offer a welcome service to parents in Scotland by opening up that variety in their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman raised the question of the schools which I said were not accepted. I ask the hon Gentleman to be a little more careful in the words he uses, not because I am embarrassed by what he said but simply because it will be misleading for people who read his remarks who could conclude that I had rejected the schools personally. My right hon Friend and I act on the advice of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools in these matters, and I am sure that all members of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>590</span>
Committee will agree that that is the correct and proper way to make any assessment of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of schools registration and inspection is carried out under existing legislation embodied in the 1980 Act. These are proved procedures which enable anyone who is involved with a school of that sort to apply for registration. Of course, that immediately opens up questions of inspection and the ability or otherwise of the school to satisfy Her Majesty's inspectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the hon Gentleman's interpretation of his ministerial responsibilities quite remarkable. Of course, Her Majesty's inspectors are advisers to him, but any final decisions which have to be taken are his vis-a-vis the House. I hope that the Minister is not implying that he would never take a decision against the wishes of his advisers. There was a slight implication of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon Gentleman is taking a narrow view of what I said. I would not consider myself competent to decide whether a school should or should not be admitted. As I am sure the hon Gentleman will appreciate, the job of inspecting a school requires a great deal of professional skill, which the HMIs have. Clearly, in certain circumstances one will ask why this and why that, but it would be great arrogance for any Minister to believe that he knew better than a professional adviser whether a school should be admitted to such a scheme or be dealt with in any other manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does not the Minister consider it inconsistent that, on the advice of the inspectors, he is prepared to refuse the right of these schools to participate in the scheme but he is not prepared to refuse them the right to operate, to charge fees and to take money off unsuspecting parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It depends on the inspectors' view of the academic performance of the school. I notice that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) appears to be agreeing with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:He is not. I beg his pardon. I thought that the suggestion was that there must be criteria of an academic nature which apply to all schools in Scotland. The HMIs inspect schools in the public sector as well as those in the private sector. Schools are not always set up for academic education. A school might be excluded because of the regime practised in the school. It might be a regime of discipline and upbringing which was not up to the standards of the public sector in the view of the HMIs. Those are the main standards on which inspectors make their assessment of schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:When the Minister says "up to", does he really mean "up to" or does he mean "different from"? Certainly, I spoke earlier about one school for which I believe the reasons are those of difference in regime and disciplinary standards rather than of being up to the standards set in other schools. It is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>591</span>
deliberate policy. It is not that something has gone wrong in the school. It is a deliberate policy. It is a different type of regime. I believe that we should emphasise that, and I should be worried if the Minister and his advisers were rejecting schools of that nature simply because they were different from the average or normal type of school, because such schools have played a part in educational experimentation and development generally, although they do not play so great a part now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am delighted at the hon Gentleman's last remarks, because they support our contention that one of the vital necessities for retaining and supporting a private sector—very small though it is because it caters for only about 4 per cent, of the school population—is the innovation and variety which such schools introduce into education generally. I do not believe that anyone in the public sector should be so smug or arrogant as to think that the public sector is the home of all educational innovation. I am glad that the hon Gentleman agrees that educational innovation can, and does, contribute, to a considerable extent— certainly in excess of the small proportion of the school population which goes to private schools. Certainly, such schools provide a welcome and important fund of ideas and innovations, not just throughout the private sector but among many enlightened participants in public sector education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the inspectorate, I do not wish to refer to any specific case. The hon Member for Cathcart tried to lead me down the road of discussing one particular school. What matters is that the inspectorate makes a total assessment of the school. Of course, the discipline, the regime, academic standards and everything else are taken into account. If a school fails overall, however innovative it may be in one respect, I believe that the high standards which are set by the inspectorate are more important than any innovation in any particular school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us specifically whether the separate arrangements to which the Government have come in respect of St. Mary's music school are in any way connected with the inspectorate's report on that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have already said that I do not wish to consider any specific school, but the hon Gentleman has named a school. Of course, we would not take any steps to continue to assist St. Mary's music school if it did not satisfy Her Majesty's inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer finally to amendment No. 138, which would give the Secretary of State power to require participating schools to publish annual reports giving details of relevant academic information. I am happy to say that the amendment is unnecessary, but I am in full sympathy with the thinking behind it and I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the position about information to be provided by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is that participating schools should be placed under the same obligation as to publication of information as is to be placed on public sector schools
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>592</span>
under section 28B. Hon Members may have noted that the regulations laid on Monday 30 March do not go as far as that, but require schools to publish only the fact that they are participating schools and particulars of the examinations for which they enter pupils and the results obtained. That is because we have now embarked on consultation, which will bring out the best description of the information that we shall wish to include generally on all schools, whether they are public or private, participating in the assisted-places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister one or two questions. I was disturbed by his reference, at the outset of his remarks, to nationality. This Bill, and all connected with it, was, I think, prepared before the Government published the British Nationality Bill. That Bill is now before another Standing Committee of the House. It has been subjected to considerable amendment and may be subjected to further amendment in the course of the Committee proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of nationality enshrined in this legislation may be very different from the end product that will emerge when the British Nationality Bill becomes an Act. It is common knowledge that that Bill has created a great deal of controversy. We, as Scottish Members—1 think everyone here will agree— have had massive representations against that Bill by the Scottish Church and by other organsiations throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in that Bill will have profound implications for entry of particular students and pupils to these schools. We wish to be clear that none of those schools will apply the remotest suspicion of a racialist entry. It would be devastating. We do not like the scheme anyhow, but if any suspicion of such malpractice were to emerge, all hell would be let loose in Scotland and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was inclined to brush the amendments aside, though they were probing amendments. They seek to delete, or to obtain explanations for, the vague phraseology such as " or other matters " on page 28 in subsection (9) (a). That is dealt with in amendment No. 136. Amendment No. 137 seeks to delete
	<br><q><p>"such other matters as appear to him to be requisite for the purposes of the scheme."</p></q>
That is nonsense. It does not mean anything—at least, it does not mean anything to me. The Secretary of State is being given extremely wide powers. He will be able to decide which " other matters" he considers relevant to the operation of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 would oblige schools to publish annual reports. The Minister refers us to the regulations, but those regulations will not be subject to the detailed scrutiny of Parliament. They will not be brought before a Committee so that we can go through them with a fine-toothed comb and amend them. The Secretary of State is taking administrative and executive power. The basic principle of public accountability is being infringed. Considerable sums of public money are involved in the scheme, and over the years those sums will increase. The Government's declared aim is to consolidate and extend the scheme, which will cost increasing sums of public money. In the other sector, however, they will slash, slash and slash again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are angry about the argument of principle in-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>593</span>
volving public accountability. There is tight control in the public sector. There are cash limits, and local authorities will have to dismiss hundreds of teachers over the next two or three years. One or two universities may even go bankrupt and have to close. Yet we are to mollycoddle the assisted places scheme. It is to be kept under wraps and protected from public accountability. Will the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs be empowered to conduct a narrow but thorough investigation of how the scheme is working, and of the way in which the schools are admitting pupils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shrugs his shoulders as if to say "That is nothing to do with us." It is everything to do with us. We, the taxpayers, will provide the cash. The education of those children will be of national interest—not to the parents and the child alone, but to all of us. Therefore, there must be more public accountability for that privileged sector of education than is provided in the clause, or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister saying that the Secretary of State will keep a rein on the scheme, that he will produce the regulations and consult this body and that body. It seems that the only body that will not be consulted is Parliament. Once the scheme gets under way, there will be no means, or very few means, by which we shall be able to challenge, criticise and probe it. The Minister does not do justice to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before in the Committee that I know when and how to make party-political points. The Minister, however, cheapens himself and the importance of the Committee when he seeks either to distort or to brush off the Opposition's arguments. Those arguments are important for Scotland—for parents, children, taxpayers and ratepayers. The Minister had better understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say that if I trip up slightly and do not make exact references to the provisions, I hope that you, Mr. Hunt, and the Committee will excuse me. My mind, unlike those of other members of the Committee, has not been devoted to these matters over the past few weeks. I am afraid that I have been detached elsewhere. As the Committee knows, I have been recruited because of the regrettable illness of one of my hon Friends. I should, therefore, be more than usually willing to give way, especially to Conservative Members who wish to correct me about anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, too, since this is my first day on the Committee, that I have a particular interest—I nearly said "concern", meaning worry—in this part of the Bill. That is because I have had the somewhat doubtful privilege and pleasure of serving on no fewer than five of the governing bodies of the schools involved in the scheme. That was very revealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should reassure my hon Friend that that was connected with nothing but the public position to which I was elected—and that the chairman of the Lothian education committee had a seat on various governing bodies. It was a revelation to hear the attitudes of different governors. For example, Fettes was noted for the glass of sherry at every governors' meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? It is good for the constitution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with that, as the hon Member points out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt my hon Friend, who is also a personal friend. I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming him to the Committee. His contributions will be of great interest to us. However, I referred to those sherry parties in a previous debate. We should be careful about such things. The Minister could easily be handing out more money within the old boy network.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has shown his usual perspicacity and ability to put his finger on the point. No doubt there are contacts between the Minister and members of the board in Edinburgh clubs and elsewhere. 1 vividly recall discussions in the Fettes board of governors about pupils to be admitted in the coming year. Inevitably, there were such remarks as "Oh yes, he's so-and-so's grandson; I remember when his father was here." Those were the sort of criteria that were used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say with some regret that there are two schools included in the list which should not be there. That is no fault of the Government or of the schools. I am sorry to say that it is because the previous Government did not do as much as I should have liked to get rid of those schools. One is Mary Erskine school, for which the Lothian regional council put forward a proposal for its incorporation into the local authority system. It was almost completed and then vetoed by the previous Government. The other is George Heriot's school, which we were well on the way to taking over. Some of us said at the time—we have been proved right—that if those schools had been incorporated into the local authority system, a future Tory Government would not be able to introduce the sort of scheme they are now proposing. That would have meant nearly 2,000 fewer places for privileged, snobbish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again speaking from my experience on governing boards, I have found that the vast majority of places that are provided in those schools are for children whose parents can afford to pay. The law of supply and demand applies. Under the Labour Government it became increasingly difficult—I pay tribute to that Government for it—for parents to send their children to those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fewer people were able to pay for their children to go to them. Fees were going up, and people were being discouraged from sending their children to such schools in a number of ways. Certainly, the local authorities also discouraged them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time it was interesting to note that the boards of governors of a number of those schools had a particular concern about what they thought was the quality of the pupils they were getting. I am sure that the Minister will recall that, because he represents an area that is well served indeed by private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting now to see the Minister putting through this measure. As my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said, it is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>595</span>
travesty to see it being put through at a time when there are cutbacks in education elsewhere. It was very much the brainchild of the Minister and some of his colleagues in Edinburgh. It is very much an Edinburgh scheme, conceived to help out the bourgeoisie in Edinburgh, the schools in Edinburgh and the sort of new club Mafia which exists in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That exists in Edinburgh, where the judges and advocates are former pupils of Edinburgh academy, along with other people who have influence in the merchant company of the city of Edinburgh and have twisted the arms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am following the remarks of the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) with considerable interest. I wonder whether I could have your advice, Mr. Hunt, on which part of the clause referred to in amendments Nos. 136, 137 and 138, it is that the hon Gentleman proposes to give us some indication of his knowledge, because what we are listening to is certainly drifting far away from the matters referred to in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had a feeling for some time that the hon Gentleman has strayed a little from the terms of the amendments. I was allowing the hon Gentleman some latitude in view of the fact that it is his first appearance in the Committee, but I hope that he will now restrict his remarks to the precise terms of the amendments that we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Do not you agree that it is a little discourteous of the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) to intervene in the manner he did in the speech of one of my hon Friends who is just embarking on his first session with the Committee? We respect your Chairmanship and your attempts to protect my hon Friend, but it was rather churlish of the hon Gentleman to behave in the way he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am sure that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who was exalting his knowledge of education and Committees, is perfectly well aware of what an amendment is and needs no assistance from the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). Nor was it churlish of me to raise that point of order, which was a perfectly competent point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can take anything from the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). My goodness, he gives us some strange things at times, but he gets as good as he gives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment before us. Apart from the principle of the assisted-places scheme, the regulations which we are discussing are the most important aspect of the whole scheme. Aside from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>596</span>
financial aspects, which are certainly of importance, subsection 9(c) states:
	<br><q><p>"the requirements as to age, residence or other matters which are to be the conditions of eligibility for an assisted place".</p></q>
The "conditions of eligibility" form an important aspect of the assisted-places scheme, and that is what we are talking about. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East is aware that that is what we are talking about, and he rightly pulled me up when I moved beyond that subject. The conditions of eligibility are the whole basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There are at least 24 hours before the hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) and I have to be in Stranraer, so there is no worry on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions of eligibility are extremely important. I gather that the Government are taking no interest in that matter whatsoever and are saying that the schools will have to draw up the conditions of eligibility and will have to make up the entrance rules. As my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said, that is entirely wrong. First, it is entirely wrong for the reason that he gave. If a great deal of public money is involved, there is a public responsibility. We are not talking about the people who are paying their own way or about the law of supply and demand. We are not talking of the bursaries that are provided by the schools themselves, which are an important element of the scheme. We are talking of money that is coming from the taxpayer and the ratepayer. The Government, as the elected authority, have a responsibility. As my hon Friend said. Parliament has a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another reason why we have a responsibi1ity and why I am worried about the whole scheme and the way it is moving, especially with regard to conditions of eligibility and the effect of the scheme on our primary schools. I do not know whether what I am about to say has been said previously in Committee; if it has, I apologise, but it is of vital concern and bears repeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen in the past the effect of the scheme, especially in primary schools, especially in Edinburgh where certain head teachers go out of their way—Corstophine primary school was a notable example— to distort their curriculum and cram pupils to prepare them for examinations under some of the schemes. It means that other pupils are neglected and that teachers spend an inordinate amount of time preparing for the schemes' examinations for totally wrong reasons. That is why the amendment, which relates to conditions of eligibility, should be considered at greater length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>597</span>
"nationality" or "date of birth" or, even worse, did some of them ask for ethnic origin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should be misleading the Committee if I said that I had any recollection of the details of the forms. But this point is relevant and the Committee ought to consider it. The application form and the questions asked on it—especially if they were the kind of questions to which my hon Friend referred—could cause deep concern to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I sometimes think back to the more a fluent days under the previous Labour Government when this scheme was conceived by the present Minister and his colleagues, who must, if they have a conscience, feel some embarrassment at pushing it through now at a time of great public expenditure cuts, and I often wonder about the basic reasons for people wanting to opt out of the State system and send their children to such schools as Fettes, Loretto, Watson's and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view that it is not for educational reasons. I have visited the schools and know of the education that they provide. I am not critical of it any more than I am critical of the education provided in all the local authority schools in Lothian region and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is only one reason—snobbery. It is the social cachet, and being able to wear the old school tie and get some kind of perceived social advantage. That is why we must strongly oppose the proposal. That is why the regulations are important and the criteria for eligibility is the most important part of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister wishes there to be as little public scrutiny of that as possible, but we must open it up to as much public scrutiny as possible so that people can understand the real motivation of the snobs behind the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these regulations are so important, it is a great pity that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), his colleague the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) and others of his hon Friends have not bothered to read them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are hearing the arrogance and the true voice of Lothian region, which will tell us where to send our children and that, as parents, we must not expect any locus or status in choosing a school. That is the true voice of Lothian region, and the hon Member had to flee to South Ayrshire because so many parents chased him out of Lothian region because of the damage he caused the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to points raised briefly by the hon Member for Fife. Central and, at some length, by the hon Member for South Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between the arrangements made for admission to a school, which are entirely a matter for the schools, and the arrangements made for eligibility to obtain an assisted place. Therefore. the Government are saying that the arrangements made for admission to the school are entirely a matter for the schools themselves, following their own criteria. The second point is that the arrangements made for eligibility for admission to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>598</span>
scheme are essentially a matter for the Government. That is why the draft regulations were put before the Committee a week or so ago, in order that members could, in considering the assisted-places scheme, under clause 5, also be able to study the eligibility for admission to the scheme laid down in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the important question raised by the hon Gentleman about nationality, as he will see in page 3, part II, of the regulations on eligibility for admission to assisted places, we are referring to nationals domiciled in EEC countries. That is the "nationality" criteria that we are applying. It has nothing to do with race, and nothing to do with whether one's parents are from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ireland or any other country. We are concerned that if someone is from within the United Kingdom, then that person or that person's family will be British passport holders. We are also concerned with those who may be in the United Kingdom but from, for example, France or Germany, both member countries of the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon Member for South Ayrshire gets up too quickly, as he usually does, let me say that those are the normal arrangements and criteria laid down within the EEC. We have done nothing more in the regulations than to include in them the normal EEC arrangements of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about eligibility and the admission as practised by the school as being two different matters. In other words, I take it that the Government are to lay down, by regulation, which pupils would be eligible for admission, but then the schools themselves would determine which of those children should be admitted. If that is the case, the schools could still practise a covert policy of racialism. That is one of the charges made against the current British Nationality Bill—that it is not a nationality Bill, but is a racialist Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the British Nationality Bill, and these references are completely out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am sorry, but the regulations specifically refer to, and define, what they mean by "nationality", in terms of residential qualifications, and the rest. I was seeking to probe the Minister about whether those regulations were drawn up before the British Nationality Bill, now before the House, was in draft, and whether there is any conflict between the one and the other. We would like to be satisfied that the regulations will conform in these matters to the terms of the British Nationality Bill, when it becomes an Art, and that they include an assertion that any school suspected of practising racialist policies in admissions of pupils would be deregistered, or whatever the disciplinary action might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing racialist in the aspects of the eligibility for admission that we are discussing. We would not publish regulations that held any racialist content. The British Nationality Bill to which the hon Gentleman referred, is con-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and the definition which results in a passport. We are concerned here with passport holders. The passport that a person holds determines his or her nationality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman has got it the wrong way round. What will happen—I have said this a number of times but I do not object to repeating it—is that parents will apply to a school and if the school admits that child the parents must comply with part TI of the regulations. Any school discriminating on grounds of race is open to a whole panoply of race equality and race relations legislation, which is not a part of our responsibility here. If the hon Gentleman thinks that schools are practising discrimination, it is a matter for him to take up with the schools. It has nothing to do with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just shrug it off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not shrugging it off. If the hon Gentleman wants to point his finger at schools in Scotland that are discriminating against pupils on racial grounds, I hope that he will do so not only inside but outside of the Palace of Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is a great accuser and always has been. He has one of the bitterest and most twisted minds that has ever been in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of eligibility for admission comes second to the application for admission to the school. When a child goes to a school and is admitted, and the parents wish to apply for an assisted place, they must comply with part II on page 3 of the draft regulations, which are available to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow those remarks to go unchallenged. I never said—the Minister knows that I never said it—that any school in Scotland was practising racialist policies. What I said was that if the regulations provide for definitions of nationality or residential qualifications in contradistinction to what emerges from the British Nationality Bill now in Committee, it would be possible—that is all I said—for one of or more of these schools to practise covert racialist policies of discrimination when they allowed or disallowed pupils to enter the school. I said no more and no less than that.

We are not satisfied with the Minister's answers. I hope that we shall come back to these matters on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 29, line 15, leave out from "such" to "schools" in line 17 and insert:
	<br><q><p>"local authorities, General Teaching Council Professional Organisations and representatives of participating schools".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 141, in page 29, line 18, leave out "two", and insert "one".</p>
	<p>No. 142, in page 29, line 21, leave out "two years" and insert "six months".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in this part of the clause are far too narrow. If the regulations are to be reviewed by the Secretary of State, the wording should be more specific and should not merely say—
	<br><q><p>"such bodies as appear to him to be appropriate and to be representative of participating schools".</p></q>
Therefore, we included local authorities, though we did not use the expression "COSLA". We found in another Bill that "COSLA"—the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities—was regarded as too restrictive as, in time, there might be changes in local authorities. We included the General Teaching Council, which advises the Secretary of State on teaching and school education matters. Professional organisations were included because the teaching trade unions also have professional status in their relationship to what is taught in schools and to the standards of education prevailing in Scotland. Lastly, but not least, we included representatives of participating schools. Therefore, I believe that amendment No. 140 speaks for itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also felt that the regulations should be under continual review. For differing reasons, several of my colleagues have expressed doubt about the acceptability or otherwise of the regulations. We hope that the regulations will be reviewed as quickly as possible after they come into force. One year after that date, rather than two years, would not be unreasonable. Thereafter, there would be half-yearly revisals. As soon as the regulations had been applied to allow children
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>601</span>
to participate in the scheme, there would be a review. It would be carried through in sufficient time for the next year's academic group to be looked after under any new regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that such a proposal would impose a burden on the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, having set up the scheme, he should be responsible for carrying it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme has already caused some anxiety in educational circles. The Minister is virtually friendless as regards the bodies consulted about the assisted places scheme. It is doubly important to allay any fears or misgivings which they might have about the working of the scheme. Therefore there should be the widest possible consultation with the bodies suggested. In the first instance, the review should take place annually rather than biennially. Subsequently, once the system is operating, it could be quickly reviewed at six-monthly intervals to allow for the speedy implementation of any amendments. Therefore, the next year's intake of youngsters could be dealt with in the fairest possible way—although under a scheme which we consider to be intrinsically unfair anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interim regulations which have been laid will serve as a basis for comment and consultation by any party which wishes to make representations to the Government. We shall be delighted to hear from any such body that wishes to comment on the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is undesirable to specify, in this part of the Bill, those bodies from which we wish to receive advice, because we would thereby run the risk of exclusion. That is in accordance with normal drafting practice. Experience shows that as soon as one begins to specify in such a context, there is the risk of exclusion. Therefore, generality is preferred. The Bill does not restrict or hinder the scope for comment and consultation on the matter. Quite simply, everybody and anybody who wishes to comment or consult may do so. To prescribe these matters in the Bill would be totally unsatisfactory and in much too narrow a context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear whether the Minister is speaking about the same part of the clause, which refers to
	<br><q><p>"such bodies as appear to him to be appropriate".</p></q>
That means that the Secretary of State can exclude bodies, or not invite them. But the Minister implied that all bodies which wished to make a submission could do so. That is not what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The Secretary of State seeks out the opinions of the bodies that the hon Gentleman mentioned, but if new bodies came along and wished to offer their advice, that would mean altering primary legislation. But in addition, where education is concerned, other people never seem to hesitate to send in their views to the Department. Those are greatly welcomed, and we should not want anything to inhibit that practice in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendments Nos. 141 and 142, I think that the hon Gentleman is playing a game with the Committee. The consultation periods in the Bill are realistic, but those proposed by the amendment of six months would require an operation similar to that of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>602</span>
painting the Forth railway bridge. No sooner would one consultation period be over than another would start. So we believe that what is in the Bill is entirely adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is irrelevant for a future Labour Government, because we shall repeal the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill—namely, that dealing with the assisted places scheme. The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. McKay) is being helpful. He is also staying awake, which is amazing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole exercise is a farce. It is becoming clear that the Minister pays no attention to any views put to him in consultations. We have seen that with regard to colleges of education and in the whole principle of the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are in somewhat muddy waters. We realise that for families with lower incomes and other disadvantaged groups a variety of bodies provide information and advice. With respect to the Scottish Education Department, we do not think that it is necessarily the fount of all wisdom and experience in the matter.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>603</span>
We are concerned here with two bodies: the social work departments of local authorities and the Department of Health and Social Security, both of which have unrivalled expertise on these subjects and whose advice and help ought to be considered. We feel that they would be more appropriate as sources of information and assistance than some of the bodies that the Minister suggests. Therefore, we would be happier if the social work departments and the Department of Health and Social Security were actively involved in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made clear that nothing in the Bill involves local authorities in the assisted places scheme. We think that that is right. They have certain powers in these matters, but the schools manage themselves, and most of them do so extremely well without having a centralised education department. That includes the SED, whose role, as I have said, is mainly one carried out by the inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need to involve the DHSS or the local authorities in provision for the children in the schools. In the regulations, we have tried to stay as close as possible to the provisions made in the public sector, and we believe that the schools have proved, over the years, that they have the ability to manage these matters and to care for the children. If they needed particular advice, I am sure that they would not hesitate to approach any of those relevant departments. I do not, therefore, believe that the amendment is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not being quite as helpful here as we might wish. That is putting it mildly. Local authorities have an input in respect of the social work function. That is what we are talking about, not the educational function. I am glad that the Minister responsible for health matters is here, because he has responsibility for social work in Scotland and might, if he paid attention, even learn something or be able, later on, to give us the benefit of his advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, given the hour and the circumstances in which we have been working in the House in the last two days, we shall seek to withdraw the amendment. We feel that the discussion of certain aspects of the regulations will be in order on Report, when the matter can be dealt with on the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 29, line 46, leave out "schools" and insert "school".

	<br><q><p>"or any other social security provision which has the purpose of assisting with the finances of poorer disadvantaged families".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, we are asking that other consultations shall be involved in the question of supplementary benefit. We know that this is one of the most vexed grey areas of our social security legislation. We feel that whoever operates the scheme, whether the SED or the schools themselves, clear provision ought to be made for fairly wide consultations. I accept that criticism can be made of the use of the term "COSLA" here as being too restrictive. We would, therefore, be happy to seek to withdraw the amendment and reintroduce it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 150. which seeks to insert the words
	<br><q><p>"or any other social security provision which has the purpose of assisting with the finances of poorer disadvantaged families".</p></q>
We think that it would be unduly restrictive simply to write in "family income supplement and supplementary benefits". There may be a new name for benefits to help those who are entering the poverty sector of our society. We believe that as the Government's policies work their way through the system, more and more people will be in the poorest groups in society and that such individuals will have to be helped, by a variety of means, because they will not be covered by the legislation to which the Minister refers in the Bill. We think that a more flexible definition would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that our definition may not be acceptable to the Minister, so again we would be willing not to press the amendment but to reintroduce it on Report, or even to ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to make his own legislation more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 151, we have drawn attention to the fact that a considerable amount of travelling may be entailed in the pursuit of knowledge by the children who will be attending schools under this scheme. The Minister has told us that there is a possibility of journeys of some 50 miles round trip per day. If those children come from poor homes, they may have to leave home too early, or the families will be unable to provide an adequate breakfast for the children, and so that they may benefit from this scheme they may need not only a meal in the morning but one in the middle of the day, too. That is why we decided to delete
	<br><q><p>"in the middle of the day"</p></q>
so that the legislation would be sufficiently flexible to afford breakfast to be provided by the institutions to which the children will be going, if, as we are led to believe, those children will be coming from disadvantaged homes within the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that at this late hour these amendments may well add dimensions to the Bill which have hitherto been beyond the ken of the Minister. Therefore, we are willing to assist the Minister by withdrawing the amendments now and returning to them on Report when we can debate them more fully, by which time the Minister may have had the opportunity to reflect on them and to consider that the points we have made are well founded, and that perhaps it is simply an error of draftmanship on our part which prevents him from accepting them. Nevertheless, we shall return to these points on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>605</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw the Minister's attention to amendment No. 151 which seems reasonable because the wording in the clause which states
	<br><q><p>"in the middle of the day"</p></q>
seems to be strange, peculiar and eccentric. If the Government intended that those pupils attending the grant-aided schools under the assisted places scheme should get school meals at the middle of the day, 1 should have thought that the clause should refer to school meals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the arguments in regard to school transport, breakfast, tea or whatever, put by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), is appropriate—perhaps that is straining a bit, as he would probably admit—but I have never come across the term
	<br><q><p>"in the middle of the day"</p></q>
in legislation. Therefore, I ask the Minister to have a fresh look at the wording of that part of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to look at the terminology
	<br><q><p>"in the middle of the day"</p></q>
and come back to it if I can enlighten the hon Gentleman in any way as to why that particular expression has been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the generality, I believe that it is an insight into the view of society as seen by Opposition Members that they think that in both the public and the private sector of schools, this sort of regulation and involvement in bureaucracy is necessary. 1 do not share that view, either for the public or the private sector. I believe that any well-managed school and any caring teachers, as most of them are, whichever sector they are in, can look after the children, and can make provision in these respects where necessary without involving a great deal of bureaucratic regulation. Certainly, in regard to this scheme we are happy to leave the management to the schools, and to make provision in the regulations for the specific items of meals and clothing as they stand in the regulations before the Committee. So, I do not wish to accept these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not refer to amendment No. 150, which deals with exactly the kind of point which he has been complaining about in some of our other amendments—namely, that the Bill as worded is too specific. Our amendment gives it a generality, and we think that that is required. I think that the Minister might just respond on amendment No. 150, which is designed to widen the areas, away from supplementary benefit and family income supplement to perhaps other areas
	<br><q><p>"which has the purpose of assisting with the finances of poorer disadvantaged families".</p></q>
I think that the Minister might take that on board in line with his other remarks on specifics and his possible need to come back if his right hon Friends in other Departments were to change the terminology of, say, the family income supplement and introduce some other scheme. If that happened, he would have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>606</span>
to bring primary legislation back to the House to change that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case. The supplementary benefit and the family income supplement are well used and well understood terms. I do not believe that amendment No. 150 would be helpful in the way that the hon Gentleman recommends, for the reasons that I gave previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We realise that it is late, but we should like the Minister to seek the advice of his advisers on this matter. Perhaps the legislation is deficient in being too specific. We do not seek to cause trouble but we feel that this is an important question. We are dealing with families—albeit a relatively small number—whose opportunities to participate in a scheme, about which, we concede, we are not very happy, are endangered if the framing of the legislation is such that some people would be written out because of the type of benefit they receive, regardless of the definition at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman is referring to amendment No. 150, I shall be happy to reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
