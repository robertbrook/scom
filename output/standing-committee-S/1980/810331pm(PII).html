<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from col. 530]</p>
<p>8.49 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for allowing us a couple of extra minutes, during which the usual channels doubtless worked their wonders to perform.<br><br>
When we adjourned I was saying that the amendment was concerned with providing the Minister with information upon which the scheme could operate. It is not my intention that this should necessarily be a delaying amendment, because I am sure that the Minister can carry out the survey fairly quickly. The information that I have provided—and I am sure that other information will come to hand—will enable him to see more clearly the distribution within Scotland and between the sexes, and to consider the question of the means by which the schools propose to accept children for the scheme.<br><br>
My reading of the situation so far suggests that probably only the Rudolf Steiner school in Edinburgh places no great emphasis on rigorous and rigid methods of assessment. I might return to the subject later, because I did some reading today on the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner and found a word that I had not previously discovered—anthroposophy. I am not sure of its pronunciation, but perhaps a learned Conservative Member will have had an opportunity to check on it.<br><br>
Anthroposophy requires a school to be fairly liberal, and one of the criteria, probably the only one that is applied to entrants, is the ability to pay. There are no vigorous tests. It sets itself against academic testing. I know that other schools are involved in the scheme whose academic standards are not all that high, but in Edinburgh there are establishments that eater for what can only be called the idiot children of the spendthrift middle class.<br><br>
I recognise that once again the Minister has not tried to discriminate in any way when dealing with the academic standards of these institutions. Some of those applying for the scheme may wish to send their children to these schools not for academic reasons, but because they want them to attend what they consider to be a posh school. Whether that school will be desirable will remain to be seen. I accept that pupils of limited ability could be accepted by some of the less desirable schools whose academic records are none too high. Under the old criteria the Scottish Education Department was prepared to regard such schools as acceptable for general standards, but they probably do not measure up to some of the local authority schools whose catchment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
areas do not lend themselves to high academic achievement.<br><br>
If the Minister is to spend taxpayers' money on a system, it should be prepared and organised far more rigorously than the system that he has presented to us. I accept that a great deal of thought has gone into the regulations—for example, the arrangements by which children will be given food in the middle of the day and the fact that they will not lack school uniforms—but the most important aspects of the whole business have been ignored. I have in mind academic standards, the manner in which a school will assess the ability and acceptability of a child for the school, the geographical distribution, the need to ensure that children all over Scotland have access to the scheme, and the vexed question of sexual discrimination and whether young girls should be entitled to similar opportunities to those for boys.<br><br>
The Minister has glided over those matters very easily so far, and we feel that paragraph (c), which we seek to add, would be a helpful way in which to make sure that this system, if it has to get off the ground— we do not want it to—does so on a far better basis than it is likely to do at present.<br><br>
The amendment is almost self-explanatory. To keep within order I had to explain it in a little more detail than I felt necessary at first, but I think that the points have been made. We want a survey to be carried out to ensure that if this wretched scheme has to go ahead it will do so on the basis of an equitable system of assisted places throughout Scotland between all boys and girls and throughout the ability range.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the Committee and to hon Gentlemen if I reply to the amendment at this stage. I think that the hon Gentleman has ranged fairly widely on the amendment. I am not sure what point he has been trying to make, because I can reply only by looking at the amendment itself. It would require the Secretary of State to carry out a survey of all fee-paying secondary schools to assess the possibility of securing a distribution of assisted places that was equitable from the points of view of geography, ability and sex.<br><br>
I am happy to tell the Committee, and in particular the hon Gentleman, that the amendment is not necessary. We already take account of those factors because, as a consequence of the normal processes of registration and inspection, we already possess all the information that we need about the location of fee-paying secondary schools and the ability range and sex of the pupils for whom they provide education.<br><br>
We do not start up the schools, so their location might be a little uneven. That was why the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) asked whether I could guarantee that 85 per cent, of the population of Fife were within 25 miles of a school in the assisted places scheme. We have all the information that we need about the schools. They have to pass the inspectorate's rigid demands. Because of that, the amendment, which it has taken us the best part of an hour and a half to debate, is totally unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have the information, but he has not sought to use it. If he had used it, he would have been able to justify his position. He has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
not told us whether the distribution between the sexes is equitable, nor, apart from some flannel on the 25-mile limit, has he said much about the geographical distribution. Furthermore, he has not told the Committee whether any attempts were made to secure a more equitable geographical distribution or whether some institutions could have been sold the scheme. I imagine that the Minister approached this matter with some evangelical zeal, but whether that took the form of a hard sell to the institutions concerned I do not know.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will reply to those points. He may have the information, but that does not mean that he has used it. Will he be a wee bit more specific about these matters?</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We invited all schools outwith the State sector to consider the assisted places scheme, wherever and whatever they were. Some were slower than others to respond. Some, particularly boarding schools, felt that the scheme had nothing to do with their operations. But, as news of the scheme has spread and the Government's intentions have become better known, I cannot believe that a single school in Scotland outwith the State sector has not been aware for some time of the Government's intention to introduce an assisted places scheme.<br><br>
On that basis, we believe that school governors have considered the proposals that are before the Committee and that before and since 10 December, when the Bill was published, they have had every opportunity to make representations to the Scottish Education Department. Their representations have been considered, and I think—I am speaking from memory— that all but two schools have been found by the inspectorate to be worthy and able to be included in the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not serve any useful purpose by being so offhand in dealing with the amendment, and I do not believe that he has the information that is asked for in it.<br><br>
Accepting that the Government are to impose this monstrosity on Scotland, we want to find out how the balances referred to in the amendment—the sexual balance and the balance between relative standards of ability—will be attained. Given the way in which the Government are putting the scheme into statutory form, it is impossible for them to give any guarantee that there will be a balance.<br><br>
I can give an example from Fife. As I said this morning, there is in Fife one school that has volunteered —that was the Minister's word—to take part in the scheme. It happens to be an all-girls school, and it is on the extreme east coast of Fife. What choice has a parent living in Kincardine, near Kincardine bridge, more than 50 miles away at the other end of Fife, who has two boys and wants to send those children to that school? There is no balance in Fife at all, and for boys there is no parental choice. That is the kind of imbalance that we want to put right.<br><br>
If the Government wished to introduce a scheme such as this, they should have made sure that in every education authority region there was a balance between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
boys and girls, or mixed schools, and that—as the Secretary of State implied on Second Reading—no child would be precluded from entry into the scheme by virtue of ability. The Minister said earlier today that the school would decide whether a child would be able to benefit from the education provided there, and we know that such schools make such decisions by setting an entrance examination. The school will decide without any interference from the Department, the local education authority, the parents or anyone else, and so far as I know the parents will have no right of appeal.<br><br>
Let me put a case to the Minister. It is not an unreasonable case. If a Communist, or even a known— a notorious—Labour councillor in Fife had a very able daughter who wanted to go to the school in St. Andrews, I would bet anything that that child would be prevented from attending that school, and her parents would have no redress. That is not an exaggeration. That is what will happen. We want to guard, as far as we can, against such abuses by the schools themselves or abuses that arise because the Department says that it is none of its business how the school chooses its pupils. If a school chose to victimise on political grounds—which is what it could amount to—it could so arrange its selection test as to prevent such a child from getting into the school.<br><br>
The more important educational point is that we want to make sure that no child, because of a lack of " brightness", to use the expression in the Tory manifesto, is precluded from attending such a school. If his parents want him to go to that school, for good or ill reasons, they should be able to insist on it. It should not be left to the whims of the school governors.<br><br>
In the Highlands, for instance, there is only one school—Fort Augustus Abbey school—that caters for boys. Therefore, there is no choice in the Highlands for parents with daughters. Those children could not even go to boarding school. In the Grampian region there are two schools—the Albyn school for girls and St. Margaret's school for girls. I presume that the third school, Robert Gordon's college, caters for boys. Therefore, there is no conceivable way in which one can strike a balance in that region. I think that there is only one school in Dumfries and Galloway that is for boys only. Therefore, parents with a daughter in that region have no choice unless they choose to send their child 100 miles away to the nearest school in another area.<br><br>
An important educational consideration is embodied in the amendment, and if the Minister thinks that he can brush it off blandly in two minutes in the hope that he will get away with it, he had better think again. We are determined to expose the nonsense of the Bill for what it is. It is no good mouthing sentiments about parental choice when it is denied by the way in which these schools have volunteered to operate the scheme. There is bound to be an imbalance. It is no good the Department washing its hands of the scheme and saying that it has provided parental choice, because we know that it has not.<br><br>
That is self-evident in Fife. The figures that I quoted reveal that there is no parental choice, even for girls. If parents in Kincardine wish to send their daughter to St. Andrews, she will face a journey of 50 miles or more there and back every day. God knows how many bus

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
changes she will have to make between Kincardine and St. Andrews. It would be cheaper to make the journey in a helicopter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie</span><span class='membercontribution'> Ross: She could go by boat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good idea. That reveals the kind of nonsense that is enshrined in the Bill. It is time that the Government woke up to the fact that it is a massive and wicked " con " trick on the parents in almost every region in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two points to make in response to the Minister's reply. First, I think that he is being rather bland in talking about the inspection carried out by the inspectorate of these schools. I am informed that these schools are inspected once every five years, at the most, by Her Majesty's inspectors. Surely that cannot provide the Minister with the latest information. Is the Minister prepared to tell the Committee whether he has ensured that over the past 12 months every school in the list has been inspected to see whether it meets certain criteria, which ought to be laid down in both the amendment and the Bill? I am sure that the answer will be " No ".<br><br>
I do not think that within a period of 12 months Her Majesty's inspectors could do the kind of inspection of these schools that would be necessary, together with the many other duties that they have to undertake with regard to the more important schools—the State schools. I do not believe that the inspection or the survey for which we are asking—the inspectorate has the people who should carry it out—can be done, and has been done, over that period.<br><br>
I wonder whether one particular school, Kilquhanity, has been approached or considered. This must be of some interest to the hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), as he is obviously interested in having a wider geographical spread. It is not in the ISIS list of schools, because it is perhaps not an independent school in the traditional mould. If there is such a thing as Left-wing independent school, I suppose that a school like Kilquhanity could be called that, as its methods are experimental. I am not sure whether the hon Member for Galloway would like Kilquhanity to be included in the list of schools. The State would be providing money to send children to Kilquhanity.<br><br>
You will be aware, Mr. Gourlay, as you were involved in education, that Kilquhanity is based on the educational precepts of A. S. Neill, a man of considerable vision in education, but whose ideas are generally unacceptable to the more traditional moulds of education.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the school has been included in the list. It is not on the list in the memoranda, nor is it included in the ISIS document to which my hon Friends and I have been referring. I wish to know whether the Minister approached Kilquhanity, whether it would be included in the list if the Government were prepared to accept it, or whether he knows anything about the school at all.<br><br>
The school is located in the Galloway/Dumfries area —I am not sure of its exact location. Some members of the Committee will know at least one renowned ex-pupil of that school—Bob Cuddity of STV, at one time a student rector of Edinburgh university. The school has put forward some new ideas for educational
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
experiments in the independent sector. I wonder whether, to achieve the whole range of the amendment —the geographical spread and the distribution of girls and boys across the ability range—it should be considered for inclusion in the scheme. Perhaps the Minister will tell me whether it has been considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know the school to which the hon Gentleman refers, and I know the teaching methods that it employs. I think that it would be unfair, in this or any other debate on this part of the Bill, for me to mention any school that may or may not have applied and may or may not have been accepted.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie</span><span class='membercontribution'> Ross: I apologise for being slightly hesitant in rising to speak. I thought that my hon Friend would continue for a while, but it appears that he may wish to speak again later if the Minister responds to the debate.<br><br>
We have tabled the amendment because we wish to discover whether the Government intend to ensure that the whole spectrum of educational ability is entertained in these schools. If so, we think that they must conduct a survey of the intentions of schools with regard to admissions. We believe that the Minister will encounter a great deal of hostility when he attempts to find out exactly what snobbery and class intentions lie behind the examinations set by the schools to ensure that the right type of pupil is able to take advantage of the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
We believe that there is no way in which the Secretary of State will be able to secure an equitable distribution of assisted places throughout Scotland unless the amendment is passed. I re-emphasise that we do not want to see the scheme introduced anyway, but unless the Minister carries out a survey to find out exactly how schools intend to implement the scheme it will not be possible to bring it into being.<br><br>
I should be interested to find out how far the Minister has investigated Dundee high school's intention to take advantage of the assisted places scheme. I raised that question on Second Reading, when I also raised with the Minister the question of the haste with which Dundee high school had circumvented the parliamentary procedure and advertised the scheme. In fact, the school went further—I do not know whether it contravened parliamentary procedure—and if the rector of Dundee high school happened to be in the room, you may have wanted to summon him to the front of the Committee, Mr. Gourlay, and give him a lecture on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that I had made it clear that it was not in order to refer to anyone sitting in the Public Gallery. Therefore, the Chair could not take cognisance of any hon Member sitting there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so, Mr. Gourlay. I do not think the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is yet the rector of Dundee high school, although he may aspire to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rule that I just stated applies also to hon Members.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0304">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that I should have made my plea to Mr. Speaker, who may have summoned the rector to the Bar of the House to lecture him—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.I think that I should hold a class on procedure. The Speaker is bound by the same rules as the Chairman in a Committee. Neither the Speaker nor hon Members can refer to anyone in the Public Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to strain your patience, Mr. Gourlay, but I thought that Mr. Speaker had the right to summon to the Bar of the House a person who he thought was abusing parliamentary privilege and ask him to explain his conduct. Labour members of the Committee are concerned about the haste of and the negation of parliamentary procedures by Dundee high school in issuing a prospectus in advance of the Committee deciding what should be done, for an entrance examination for those foolish enough to take part in the assisted places scheme. Parliament should seriously consider that.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Secretary of State for Scotland was in no doubt about those for whom the assisted places scheme was intended. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no restriction according to the ability of the child. The decision on whether the child will benefit will depend upon whether the family is on a low income …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>… The children who benefit may be of any ability—good, bad or indifferent. The common factor is that their families will all have low incomes".—<i>[Official Report,</i> 12 February 1981; vol. 998, c. 1015.]</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State is a very nice chap and a good lad—or at least he used to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that I should draw the attention of hon Members to the fact that the description of Members of Parliament, whether or not they are members of the Committee, is not relevant to the amendment. I hope that hon Members will keep within the rules of order and confine their remarks to amendment under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Gourlay. I am always grateful for your guidance. However, the amendment says that the
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State should carry out a survey",</p></blockquote>
so I thought that it was at least reasonable to refer to the person who is to carry out the survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I should tell the hon Gentleman that when a Bill refers to the Secretary of State, that reference is not to any individual. It is referring to an office of the Crown.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any Secretary of State has a fairly quaint view of Scotland and is certainly out of touch with present-day reality.<br><br>
I do not want to refer to the previous group of amendments, when I spoke about the class nature of the Bill and the products that it throws up, but we have had an example of what is liable to happen unless there is control. If the assisted places scheme finds its way on to the statute book it will continue to throw up the products such as Lord Dundee the ex-school chum of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
the present Secretary of State for Scotland. He had the advantages of an independent school education. He attended Winchester, which is the school that the Secretary of State for Scotland attended.<br><br>
In a foreword to a Dundee guidebook of the mid-1960s Lord Dundee referred to Dundee as being
<br><blockquote><p>"within a few miles of the most famous golf courses, the best grouse shooting"</p></blockquote>
in the area. I am sure that the 14,000 who are redundant in Dundee will be pleased to know that instead of taking unemployment benefit they can all become grouse beaters, but I do not think that education is supposed to ensure that people can become grouse beaters. It is supposed to educate people.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State does not have some means of ensuring that when the grant-aided scheme—however unfortunate it is—finally reaches the statute book it at least attempts to do what he says it attempts to do, namely, to ensure that children whose ability is good, bad or indifferent all get the same advantage, I do not see how the Bill can do anything other than spawn the type of animal who regards the importance of Dundee as being within a few miles of grouse shooting. That is not what the people of Dundee see as its advantages.<br><br>
When I questioned the Minister on 23 February about Dundee high school's notorious behaviour over the assisted places scheme with its entrance examination, he said that
<br><blockquote><p>"schools which participate in the assisted places scheme will be free to make the arrangements they consider appropriate in the light of their own circumstances for the admission of children to assisted places."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 February 1981; vol. 999, <i>c.</i> 287.]</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that is at odds with what the Secretary of State for Scotland says. He wants all children, whether their ability is good, bad or indifferent, to be able to take advantage of the scheme. The Minister, who is carrying the Bill through the House, is clearly out of line with what the Secretary of State for Scotland says.<br><br>
Is the Minister's reply to me of 23 February the basis on which he suggests that his hon Friends on the Conservative Benches should vote against amendment No. 122, or is it that he did not listen when the Secretary of State said that the clause was intended to ensure that children whose ability was good, bad or indifferent could take advantage of the scheme? It would be interesting to know who is right on the issue. Is it the Minister, or is it the Secretary of State? I shall look forward to the Minister's comments on who has the final say on the scheme.<br><br>
I have said several times that this scheme will operate against working-class children unless there is some control over it. There is one school in Dundee that has already superseded any decision that Parliament might take by deciding how children can take advantage of the assisted places scheme. There is a statue of Robert Burns near that school. He is not looking at Dundee high school and, if he were alive today, he would not apply there for an assisted place for any of his children. I can imagine what would happen if the Minister took his application to that school's board of trustees and said "Here we have a chap who calls himself a bit of a poet"—</span></p>

conducive to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to give an example without using the name of anyone living, as that person might object to having his family history trotted out in Committee. I was trying to say that one of our most famous national poets had children who were born out of wedlock. That happens quite often; there is nothing against those children, and I hope that no one in the Committee has anything against them. But if the parent of such a child were to apply on his behalf for an assisted place at Dundee high school I doubt whether the child would gain admission. That must concern us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene to help my hon Friend because he is struggling over the question of fairness. He does not understand that the parents have absolute freedom when asking for their children to be placed. That is the freedom of choice. However, the schools have the absolute freedom to refuse them. That is a Tory form of choice which I thought my hon Friend understood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but it is a matter of wrestling with what the Minister said and what the Secretary of State said. That is our difficulty—namely, who speaks on behalf of the Government? Is it the Minister or the Secretary of State for Scotland? We must have an answer to that, because it is very difficult for Labour Members to understand. For instance, I can imagine other people—I am certain that Billy Connolly, whom I know, would not—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman has made his point clearly enough for the Minister to reply if he so wishes. Perhaps he will pass on to another aspect of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude on this note—[Hon Members: "Hear, hear."] If it pleases the Committee, I shall continue for another 15 minutes or so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
I do not believe that there is an intention to ensure that there is any equity with regard to assisted places and their allocation. The same type of snobbery as exists within these schools at present will certainly be brought into play when any working-class child attempts to gain admission to such schools. We have said many times in Committee that we hope that there are no working-class parents who are foolish enough to try to take advantage of the scheme if it ever reaches the statute book. As many Labour Members have said, the purpose of this scheme is to cream off, if possible, some of the best children from the State sector to try to improve the standing of the grant-aided and independent schools. We do not support that, and we shall therefore certainly support amendment No. 122.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it pleases the Committee, we wish to withdraw the amendment in order to return to it on Report. We feel that there are elements on which the Minister may wish to reflect and have the opportunity of reconsidering before Report. We are totally committed to the objectives of the amendment, but we feel that it would be more appropriate to give the Minister an opportunity to reflect. When he reads his answers he may agree that some of them are not sufficiently satisfactory for the matter now to be closed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments seek to do one simple and specific thing, although it takes a number of amendments to achieve it. They seek to remove from the Secretary of State the power to determine which schools should be included in the Bill, and gives the power to the Committee. We feel that Parliament should decide, after taking account of the strengths and weaknesses of the institutions, and accepting the advice of the Minister and his staff on individual schools. The principle should be established that the Committee and the House, rather than the Secretary of State, should determine the institutions to be included in the Bill.<br><br>
We have not been greatly impressed by the Minister's answers. I know that he is not here, but I know that he would not expect me to phrase my remarks in any other way. The list of schools in annex A, which I believe is part of an answer given to the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), covers a variety of institutions with a limited geographical spread—which we have discussed already. It lists schools which have a predominantly traditional approach to education. The only school which does not fit into the normal mould is the Rudolf Steiner school in Edinburgh. From what the Minister said, it appears that another institution—Kilquhanity— which is based on similar educational principles, is perhaps not as acceptable as the one in Edinburgh.<br><br>
Nevertheless, it is an interesting phenomenon that the strictures of Labour Members about private education has always had one lacuna: what does one do with institutions that are engaged in experimental work which is outside the ambit of the local authority system? The work of people like A. S. Neill at Summer-hill and the Rudolf Steiner and other experimental schools in Britain has often had to exist outwith the State system, and outside public funding because the methods which they have tried—and I use the word "tried" rather than "applied"—are of an experimental nature and local authorities for good or bad reasons are not prepared to support them.<br><br>
One of the problems for those of us who have spoken against the private school sector has been that some of the most exciting developments, until recently, have taken place in this area. I say "until recently", because now that education is relatively well provided for—even though the present Government are determined to slash the budget for education—the opportunities for experiment and the testing of new developments is now fairly commonplace within the local authority sector.<br><br>
Especially in the primary school sector, the traditionalists have on occasion suggested that perhaps too much has been tried too quickly. I shall not enter into an education debate on that matter this evening. Suffice to say that we take the view that the Committee ought to have the opportunity of looking at the various schools, and this was the mechanism by which we sought to achieve this end.<br><br>
I have some brochures which were obtained by my assiduous colleague, my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who is elsewhere this evening on parliamentary business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Parliamentary business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon Friend is not here because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 542</span>
he is away on parliamentary business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is private business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not worry me at all. I am delighted that the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), whom we love so much in this Committee in his capacity of acting unpaid Whip, is not here. It is just a technicality. I have no objection at all and I am glad that he is away, but he is probably away more on a party invitation business than on parliamentary business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that it is a point for great debate in the Committee. The term "parliamentary business" has a wide connotation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was within that wide ambit that I was using the expression.<br><br>
Fort Augustus Abbey school is a school situated by the side, I think, of Loch Ness. It is a Catholic secondary school, with only a small number of students, which in the main is run by a teaching order. One could ask whether it is desirable to have single-sex schools in this system or schools run by lay orders, or whether schools should be near cities and exposed to the various forms of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman may wish to ask all these questions but I hope that he will be extremely brief in his references to those schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to list all the schools. I was merely seeking to point out that the virtue of amendment No. 159 was that it would allow the Committee to have responsibility for the decision on which schools should be part of the system.<br><br>
I do not propose to deal with all the schools this evening, because it would take up an inordinate amount of time when we are endeavouring to make progress. However, we are making a substantial change to the education system in Scotland through the creation of an assisted places scheme. The Opposition are opposed to the scheme, as we have made clear throughout, and we believe that we should approach it with caution. We could have a fruitful discussion, albeit a lengthy one, on the merits and demerits of each establishment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps 1 may clarify the point for the hon Gentleman. If these schools were included, the Bill would come to the dangerous point of hybridity. Therefore, any reference to them in the debate must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will concede, Mr. Gourlay, that so far I have made only a passing reference to one institution. 1 do not propose to go any further in that direction now.<br><br>
This is a mechanism whereby the Committee, if it so chose, even allowing for the principle of hybridity which we would have to avoid, could nevertheless discuss the merits or otherwise of the institutions. It would then be our responsibility to take the decision and not that of the Secretary of State. I recognise that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 543</span>
we walk a fine line and I do not wish to get out of order, so I shall finish at this point and let my hon Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman realise that if it were a case of hybridity, it might help to kill off the Bill, because in parliamentary terms it would raise certain problems affecting the legislation. If the hon Gentleman wishes to oppose the Bill thoroughly, the question of hybridity should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Member for that information. For the Bill to become hybrid, the amendment must be passed. Obviously, that is a good reason for voting for the amendment if one has misgivings about the assisted places scheme. But, knowing the arithmetic of the Committee, I think that that is a forlorn hope. I do not wish to alienate those members of the Committee who might be converted. We know that there are errant spirits on the Government side, who have been known to vote against the Government on matters of principle. We welcome their independence of mind, and hope that on this occasion—at this last moment—we might find the opportunity to encourage and entice one Conservative Member to support us.<br><br>
The group of amendments is simple and straightforward. They would give the Committee the right to determine which schools would be included in the scheme. We think that that would be a big step forward. It would give us a far more detailed and close look at each of the institutions. We have had from the Minister a statement which clearly suggests that although information is available on every one of those schools, he has not chosen to take advantage of that information and has merely approached the new scheme with a devil-may-care attitude—working on the basis that the Government should give the schools the money and let them get on with the job.<br><br>
We do not feel that that course is adequate. The amendments would enable the Committee to look far more closely at the allocation of the fee remission grants which we think have not been dealt with in a sufficiently professional manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) for another interesting speech on this group of amendments. He recently spoke to amendments Nos. 153, 154 and 159 and what he had to say was very interesting. I am pleased that he mentioned one school which has a very heavy influence in my constituency. That is the Rudolf Steiner school. I have had many meetings with those responsible for the organisation of such schools. It is not appropriate at present to go into the details of the financing, the type of students or those with or without means who attend such schools, but I was pleased that the hon Gentleman mentioned them.<br><br>
It is difficult to see any merit in the amendment. It would be extremely inconvenient to have to amend a primary statute every time the occasion arose—to add a school to the list of participating schools, or to remove one from it. There is no precedent for such an arrangement. Independent schools are registered at the discretion of the Secretary of State, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
no one has ever suggested that there would be merit in making the list of schools a part of the Education <b>Acts.</b><br><br>
The same argument applies to grant-aided secondary schools and grant-aided special schools, which have always been listed and relisted at the discretion of the Secretary of State. I would not expect the list of participating schools to fluctuate greatly, but it is only to be expected that it should alter from year to year, just as does a register of independent schools. It would be extremely inconvenient and time-wasting for Parliament, as well as for the Secretary of State, to have to bring forward amendments to a primary statute every time a change was made.<br><br>
However, I appreciate the spirit in which the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire moved the amendment. We have had an interesting debate, and this may not be the end of it. I know that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has been 'bobbing up and down in spite of the infirmity of which he informed us earlier. But meanwhile, I must say to my hon Friends that I shall eventually be asking them to resist the amendments.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to that reply, perhaps I may assure the Minister that the infirmity that I mentioned earlier is getting better all the time. By Thursday I shall be back to normal and shall be speaking at even greater length.<br><br>
The amendment and the Minister's reply raise a very important parliamentary principle. As a Member of Parliament, presently on the Front Bench, but normally on the Back Benches, I have found that there is considerable objection to the amount of power given in Acts. It has been going on for some time. Powers are given to Ministers—to Secretaries of State, in particular—to carry out certain functions, under Acts, without proper parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
It is all very well for the Minister to say "The Secretary of State has always had the power to register these schools. He will continue to use it. That therefore makes the amendment unnecessary". But we are talking about a different set of circumstances. Some of the schools—not all, by any means—were receiving public money before the advent of this Bill and before the Minister took powers under the 1980 Act. But many of them were not receiving public money. Although they had to be approved and inspected by the Secretary of State, they did not have to be approved for the purposes of receiving public money. That is what is different.<br><br>
Glasgow Academy received no public money whatever—except in respect of tax avoidance as a charitable trust. But there was no investment of public money. Now there will be that investment. There is to be a change in the way in which public money is disbursed to these schools. I refute the suggestion that it is the individual pupil who will receive benefit, and not the schools. Anyone who looks at the facts will realise that one pupil's fees pay, say, one-eighth, one-ninth or one-tenth of a teacher's salary. If there are only nine other ap-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 545</span>
plicants and the school cannot employ another teacher, with that one pupil, it will benefit and can take on nine other pupils as well as the one under the scheme. The mathematics of that may be a little convoluted, but that is the case. The school will gain the benefit, from extra money and extra pupils. Therefore, it is not fair to say that it will not do so.<br><br>
If schools are to receive public money, we think that it should be a matter for Parliament, for two reasons. First, we should know that Parliament and the Committee have decided that these are the schools which will participate. If another school wishes to participate in the scheme, it should not be included just at the Secretary of State's will. It should be brought before the House for examination. That seems to be a legitimate way, on a contentious issue such as this, for the House to take powers. We should have the control over who would come into the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon Gentleman is anticipating a debate which will follow this group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, Mr. Gourlay, but at present all these schools are included in the memoranda of the regulations. I think that schedule 1 specifies schools in the Education Allowances for Assisted Places in Secondary Schools (Scotland) Regulations 1981, which will come into operation on 15 May. In other words, it is under existing legislation that the Secretary of State is taking these powers. The amendment attempts to amend existing legislation to ensure that it now comes into the Bill instead of being left, as it was under the previous legislation, in the hands of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I take the point made by the hon Gentleman, but under the Bill as it stands there will be an opportunity for Parliament to deal with the point that he is raising. We cannot discuss the order on the amendment before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I then continue, Mr. Gourlay, by making this point? By putting the list of schools in the amendment into the Bill instead of leaving the decision to the Secretary of State, we ensure that schools coming into the scheme will come under parliamentary control. It also means—this is perhaps more important to the continuation of the children's education—that presumably schools cannot leave the scheme unless an order comes before Parliament and unless the amendment is carried.<br><br>
There is a danger that some schools may decide that the scheme is not a bad thing for them now, particularly in view of the economic circumstances in Scotland, when fewer people have large sums of money to spend on their children's education. Therefore, it may be beneficial for some schools to have the assisted places scheme to top up their numbers now, but in two or three years' time—perhaps I am being a little optimistic—if there is an economic recovery when Laibour come back into power, the schools may then be able to get all the pupils they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
require without the assisted-places scheme and may decide to cease participation. Some children who are then half-way through their secondary education may suddenly be told to leave the school, because it decides that it will no longer continue in the assisted places scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's point, which is very valid. But I trust that he will give an assurance tonight that the same thing will not happen, in the unlikely event of the Labour Party being returned to power, if it abolishes the assisted places scheme—that children at the schools at that time will suddenly find themselves without assisted places and with their education interrupted, in exactly the way that the hon Gentleman is describing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly am not prepared to give that assurance, because from the time when the assisted places scheme was first proposed we have said that if schools took it on, that was their risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nationalisation without compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If parents and schools are not aware of that fact, or are aware of it and are nevertheless prepared to go ahead and take that risk, they cannot say that they are doing so without knowing that a new Labour Government would probably do away with the scheme.<br><br>
That fact can be known. What cannot be known is whether a school will continue with the scheme. Schools will not tell parents that they will give the scheme up in three or four years' time. We have told them that if we come into power we shall end it. That is perfectly fair. We have given that information. Parents should be aware of that fact; so should the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon Friend care to remind Conservative Members that they made certain promises before they came into power? They have done their best. If there is one thing that we accept, it is that they have at least tried to carry out their manifesto commitments. For instance, they made their policy on the sale of council houses clear and they have carried it out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going backwards rather than forwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. Gourlay. Some schools might decide that in their interests it would be better to stop the scheme mid-stream. In our view, that may rescue the children, but some parents would consider it damaging to their children's education. On the point that Conservative Members were making, we believe that every parent who takes part in this scheme knows our views and knows what we have said. Therefore, they take the risk knowing the facts.<br><br>
If the amendment is passed, it would mean that if a school decided to opt out of the scheme, it would be necessary to come back to Parliament for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 547</span>
that opting out to be approved. We ought to be considering all the time, on all our Standing Committees, which powers we give to the Secretary of State and which we take within Parliament. If taking them within Parliament involves too much work, it is time that we looked at parliamentary procedures to make sure that we do the job properly.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment follows on from the last group, which sought to take powers from the Ministers and to restore them to the House of Commons. Such amendments are commonplace in legislation of this type. They are designed, first, for that purpose, and, secondly, to take up the time of the Committee in debating, voting and discussion. So far as the latter purpose is concerned, we make reference to the House of Commons only, rather than to both Houses, because in matters relating to the public— or the private—school sector, and the assisted places scheme, we do not have much confidence in the ability of the other place to deal with the subject as dispassionately as the House of Commons.<br><br>
Therefore, we request that one only of the two Houses of Parliament should have responsibility for approving the regulations which have been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter any discussions with the Labour Party about the worthiness of the House of Lords, nor do I wish to refer to the tape downstairs which suggests tonight that some argument is taking place within the Labour Party about which Members of this House should be created peers to enable some negotiations within that party to be completed. I do not understand the mysteries of the Labour Party, with its members' passionate desire to abolish the House of Lords, on the one hand, and their rush to get there, on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
other hand. As I am sure you will quickly point out, Mr. Gourlay, although that may be a matter for debate in this Committee Room, it is not a matter for debate by this Committee.<br><br>
The amendment presumably refers to the affirmative resolution procedure. It is—to be polite to the hon Gentleman—somewhat inept, because the affirmative resolution procedure is used rarely, and is used in connection with statutory matters—for example, regulations laid before Parliament. The procedure would certainly not be appropriate to a determination under new section 75A(2). The determination by my right hon Friend of a school which is to be a participating school will contain detailed matters concerning that school's—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I know that it is out of order to refer to people in the room who are not members of the Committee, but there is some noise coming from the Public Gallery. It would be helpful if I could hear the Minister's remarks without this interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I did not hear any interruption, but it should be known that although members of the public are entitled to watch and listen to our proceedings, they are not entitled to write or to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The Minister has referred to someone who is in the Public Gallery. Was it in order to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Chair did not hear the reference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, in whose name we are conducting these proceedings. Whether or not my right hon Friend is in the Public Gallery is not a matter for the Committee.<br><br>
I am surprised that the hon Gentleman raised that objection. I have been accused of many things in my career but I have never been accused of lack of volume, and I am surprised that from where he is sitting the hon Gentleman is having difficulty in hearing my remarks.<br><br>
As I was saying, the determination by my right hon Friend of a school that is to be a participating school will contain detailed matters concerning that school's participation in the scheme. It would be most irresponsible—as well as wasteful—to take up the valuable time of the House in discussing such matters. I suggest to my hon Friends that we should reject the amendment, if it is taken to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that we are conducting these proceedings in the name of the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Gourlay, and I know that you would immediately rule me out of order if I referred to the fact that I can see the right hon Gentleman in the Public Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member has already been advised of the rules of order. Once the Chair has

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
given a ruling, the hon Member ought to observe it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is at it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Gourlay, that, far from being at it again, I welcome your advice and guidance on this matter. I am always careful to try not to strain your patience. But I referred earlier to a disagreement that seems to have developed between the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State, and that may well be what has brought the Secretary of State here. I shall test your patience no further, Mr. Gourlay.<br><br>
It may well be that my hon Friend will not wish to press the amendment at present; he may wish to discuss it lurther. However, we on the Opposition Benches consider that the independent schools should be subject to the same type of democratic controls over expenditure as the State schools. The Secretary of State is taking to himself more powers, through the Local Government Miscellaneous Provisions (Scotland) Bill, to ensure that the regional authorities—the education authorities—can spend only a certain amount on education. I would hate to think that there might not be some form of control in the case of the independent sector, and I suggest that it should be the House of Commons that exercises the control.<br><br>
If we do not ensure in the Bill that there must be some examination, we may find that, simply by written notification, the sums of money involved can change overnight. I can certainly envisage that happening.<br><br>
Given the type of schools we are talking about and the type of people who operate them, it may very well be that over the cigars and the claret, with the old school tie having to be worn to gain admittance, it will be agreed by how much, by written notification, the scheme should be abused by the independent or grant-aided schools. The Opposition would be entirely opposed to this. We think that they should come under the same form of democratic control as the State schools.<br><br>
It would be ridiculous for us to allow, through our neglect, blank cheques to be written for these schools, which do not require that type of assistance. It is not good enough when our children's education —I say "our children" deliberately because we represent the overwhelming majority of children who go to State schools—is being savaged by the Conservative Party. It is not acceptable that blank cheques can be written for the independent or grant-aided schools.<br><br>
I do not accept that the Secretary of State or whoever is responsible can bypass Parliament on this issue. Once again, we must ensure that there is no cover-up and that attempts such as this are not hushed up with no debate or fuss. If the Government want to increase the money, it must be done democratically by involving Parliament and with discussion on the issue by the elected representatives. The back-door method will not be allowed to pass unnoticed. Even if this amendment is not carried, we shall keep raising the question in Parliament whenever we hear the whisper that there has been a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
meeting of the old boys to ensure that they can get some more cash which could be more profitably spent in the State sector.<br><br>
When we see about £60 million being taken—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening with great care to the hon Gentleman. I cannot relate his remarks too closely to the amendment under discussion. Perhaps the hon Gentleman can be more precise in arguing whether the determination referred to in the clause should come before the House by resolution or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. But I am speaking to amendment No. 123 in the group of amendments. That amendment adds to subsection (4), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may alter the maximum annual amount referred to in subsection (3)(a) above by written notification to the school to which it is allocated."</p></blockquote>
We are seeking to insert at the end the words
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to debate and approval by the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
I am suggesting that if we do not have that control by the House of Commons, the old school tie might come into play and, over the claret and cigars, the maximum may be raised. It may go through by written notification and no one would know anything about it. The Opposition are not prepared to allow that matter to pass.<br><br>
The Secretary of State may not intend that it should happen in that way. He may intend to inform Parliament on every occasion when that maximum is to be altered. If he does, I would welcome that assurance from the Minister. But I think that those words should at least be there. If no subterfuge is involved and if there is no substance to my suggestion, the Minister can confirm that by saying that he accepts the amendment, and we shall know that there will be some parliamentary controls in the Bill.<br><br>
At a time when £60 million has been taken from the education budget, we should insist that any money that goes into such schemes as this should carry some form of democratic control. That is why we tabled the amendment. My hon Friend may decide not to press it at this stage so that we can return to it on Report. That would allow the Minister to consult the Secretary of State to get the matter right for once and to ensure that he says nothing different from what the Minister has said. I would welcome the Minister's assurance that he will consider the matter if we decide not to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last night I had one of my rare evenings at home and had the humorous opportunity to watch what I am told is the Prime Minister's favourite television programme—"Yes Minister". At one point during that programme, as the Minister was in a great hurry to keep an engagement, his permanent secretary pushed a paper before him and said "Will you just sign this, Minister? It is nothing important. It does not matter very much. Sign this and off you go to your meeting." Because the Minister was in a hurry, and because he was to get a great deal of publicity out of his visit, he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0311">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
signed the paper. What he was signing was a paper essentially giving the powers that a Secretary of State or a Minister has under an Act to his civil servants.<br><br>
I am convinced that neither the Secretary of State for Scotland nor the Minister is like that. I am sure that no civil servant in the Scottish Office would dream of doing that. But, having watched that programme on a few occasions, I have noticed parallels with the way in which the present Scottish Office works. I have also had experience of Scottish civil servants—I make no reference to anyone in the Committee Room—and I am sure that they could behave in that way.<br><br>
The important point that came through in that programme was that in too much legislation too many powers have been given in the past by both parties when in Government, to Ministers to take decisions. These simple amendments seek to ensure that the House should debate the important issue of whether money should be increased to individual schools. As my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) said, on the one hand the Secretary of State might send an instruction to a school to increase the money, while, on the other hand, he was issuing a statement slashing yet again the expenditure on education for local authorities.<br><br>
To us, that is incorrect. That matter should be in the hands of Parliament. It may be that the wording should be "both Houses". I should not like to get into an argument with the Minister about the House of Lords or what is happening in the Labour Party. But as many powers as possible in the Bill should be kept in the hands of this House, and the Houses of Parliament generally, rather than passing them off to Secretaries of State. That often means passing powers on to civil servants without any proper democratic scrutiny of what is being done.<br><br>
Perhaps that is a Back-Bench point of view. I am on the Back Benches and that is the point of view that I am expressing. However, I think that more time should be taken to ensure that all legislation is correctly scrutinised.<br><br>
If the Minister is saying that he does not want to take up the valuable time of this House to do that, he might consider—I am sure that he is as concerned as we are about proper democratic scrutiny of legislation—convincing his right hon Friend the Secretary of State that it is time we had a Scottish Assembly so that we could look at such matters properly in Edinburgh where they ought to be looked at.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 145. in page 27, line 40, after 'school', insert
<br><blockquote><p>"at a figure of no more than £660,000 in its first year of operation and no more than £935,648 in subsequent years".</p></blockquote>
The amendment stems from an endeavour by the Opposition to control the expenditure on the scheme. We recognise that the financial resolution passed after Second Reading made some points about the assisted places scheme, although it was not specific about how much that should involve.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
We made use of a very helpful memorandum sent by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association. I have no doubt that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) had a hand in its preparation, although he is on record as saying that he is out of line with his trade union on the matter. It would probably be fair to say that he is out of line with most educational opinion in Scotland in relation to the Bill.<br><br>
10.15 pm<br><br>
However, we used the information included in the comments made by Mr. James Docherty, the general secretary of the SSTA, in which he suggested that expenditure in the first year might be about £660,000. Therefore, we used that figure for the baseline in the first year. Thereafter, we felt that a figure of £935,648, which was the amount of block aided grant in 1979, should be the maximum upon which the scheme should be funded for all time, considering the financial constraints under which we are operating at present.<br><br>
We recognise that the Government intend to ram through this legislation and that they are hell-bent on having an assisted places scheme. From our point of view, we are satisfied that, if it were implemented, it should be at a minimal degree of expenditure. The figures which we quote are modest. Those figures come from a source which cannot be said to be the most radical pressure group in Scottish education. Therefore, we thought that those figures would err on the side of generosity.<br><br>
It is a sign of our moderation in this matter that we did not cast around and try to find other figures. We recognise that a sum of £790,000 was quoted this morning, but nevertheless we should like to stick to our figure and we should like to hear whether the Minister is prepared, at this time of public expenditure cuts, to consider that the assisted places scheme could contribute towards the savings which the Government are most anxious to achieve. We feel that those cuts across the board are not a desirable objective but if there are to be any savings in public expenditure, we think that they should start with the assisted places scheme along the lines of our figures quoted in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a party that has been attacking the assisted places scheme since long before the Bill was in Committee, I am amazed at the generosity that is being offered to individual schools in the scheme. Taking the hon Gentleman's comments at face value, as one must on such occasions, he is offering to any individual school £600,000 in the first year of operation and no more than £935,648 in subsequent years. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason for the amendment other than the fact that the Opposition are so dissatisfied with the scheme that they wish to increase greatly the amount of public expenditure which would be involved. The amounts mentioned are far in excess of the grant contemplated for any school, or a group of schools, in the first year of the scheme and are ludicrously in excess of the sums that would ever be offered to most of the schools in the foreseeable future.<br><br>
Therefore, I can only suggest to the hon Gentleman that, carrying the load that he is in Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
he has perhaps misread this part of the Bill. I do not quarrel with that. It is perfectly understandable. However, I am sure that he would not wish his amendment to be supported in view of the fact that he is being about fifty times as generous with public funds for the scheme than the Government intend at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 145 was a probing amendment, and the Minister has gone some way to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
answer my points. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
