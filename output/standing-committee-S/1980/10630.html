	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has never been my practice to question the absence of a Scottish Office Minister from a debate, but I am not surprised that this morning the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) is not with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Tuesday, in what can best be described as a hysterical outburst at the end of the local government debate, the hon. Member for Pentlands described a comment by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) on the 305,800 unemployed in Scotland as a " foolish and irrelevant remark." We may have the opportunity this morning to discuss what is not a foolish and irrelevant problem—the problem of the 305,800 unemployed. I want once again to take the opportunity that the debate provides to condemn, without qualification, the hysterical outburst of the Under-Secretary in describing that problem as foolish and irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had it been possible this morning to table a motion of no confidence in the Secretary of State for Scotland in his handling of the Scottish economy we would have done so. Instead of having a general debate, we would have debated a motion of no, confidence in the Secretary of State—I am glad that the hon. Member for Pentlands has now decided to join us—but, as that is not possible, we must debate employment and the economic problems in Scotland within the confines of the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with a partial examination of the record of the Secretary of State for Scotland. When I have completed my examination at the end of my speech, I hope I shall have provided a full picture of one of the most disastrous Ministers Scotland has ever seen. It is not without coincidence that the last time the Secretary of State was at the Scottish Office, as an Under-Secretary of State— he was turfed out in February 1974—-he left the incoming Labour Government with 300,000 people in Scotland on a three-day week. We had just come through one of the worst winters of discontent. All hon. Members will remember it—no lights on the Christmas tree; people sitting in cold houses; factories not heated and 300,000 people on a three-day week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
Seven years on, the achievement of that Secretary of State is that he has turned the 300,000 people from a three-day week into being permanently unemployed. If anyone can produce a worse record than that, I am sure that the Secretary of State would be delighted if that person would claim it. But there is not a worse record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to the second part of my partial examination of the Secretary of State's record, I think that it is important to establish that we are not dealing with a Cabinet " wet" or someone who tells the press that he does not agree with the Government's policy. We are not dealing with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who runs off to America to make anti-Government speeches. We are not dealing with someone of the calibre, quality or integrity of the Leader of the House of Commons. We are not dealing with the Secretary of State for Employment, who has serious doubts about the Government's economic policy. We are dealing with a Secretary of State who is 110 per cent, in favour of the Government's economic policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is unfair to say that I am sure that the Secretary of State claims that he is totally in favour of the Government's economic policies that have led to the present level of unemployment in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth comparing the figures published in June 1979 with those published last week. No one can accuse me of being selective. I am comparing like with like. I am comparing the numbers of school leavers on the register in June 1979 and in June 1981. In June 1979, the first full month of unemployment figures for which the Secretary of State can claim responsibility, the total unemployed in Scotland numbered 182,769. That figure is not seasonally adjusted. That means that 8-1 per cent, of the working population was unemployed. In June 1981, 305,800 were unemployed—13-5 per cent, of the working population. The seasonally adjusted figure in June 1979 was 164,500, and in June 1981 it was 284,100. There has been an increase in unemployment of more than 123,000 in a short space of two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the June 1979 figures, because I trust that the hon. Gentleman will accept that in my constituency the largest area of unemployment is the small town of Blairgowrie. That was because the main employers closed down before this Government came into office. Subsequently, the knock-on effect has been very damaging. Unemployment has risen to more than 20 per cent. That was due to a closure before this Government came into office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That fact does not help the hon. Gentleman's argument, because in June 1979 the figures showed a reduction in unemployment, not an increase. That was a reduction from May 1979, which in turn was a reduction from March 1979. So, I am comparing like with like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure for unemployment of 305,800, which includes about 22,000 school leavers, is distorted. As a result of social security legislation passed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
1980,many youngsters in Scotland are not on the register. Obviously the figure for June will not include the number of youngsters who left school, or will leave school, in June. But those young people will not be included on the register during the next three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the Civil Service strike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) pays attention, he will learn something to his advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the Social Security (Contributions) Act 1981,which had the support of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East, young people who left school this week and last week will not be allowed to come on to the register before October or Novem ber this year. Any youngster from Aberdeenshire, East or from any other constituency who left school last week or this week and who wants to register as unemployed will be told that he cannot do so and he will not be paid benefit, either. It has nothing to do with the Civil Service strike, but everything to do with the change made by the Social Security (Contributions) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are now fiddling the figures, and the figures that we now have and will have in the coming months are not accurate but are fiddled because of what is happening to the school leavers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not wish deliberately to mislead the Committee, although I can understand his doing so if he is not aware of the facts or not as well informed as he should be. There is nothing to prevent young people registering as unemployed under the new arrangements for paying social security that were introduced by the Act to which he referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have paid attention to Oscar Wilde, who said that we should never listen to a man with short legs because his brains were too near his backside. The unemployment benefit managers, on instructions from the Government, are not allowing young people to register as unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we get this right for the sake of the youngsters. If the Minister believe that those young people can register, he had better tell his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment to write to the unemployment benefit managers and tell them to allow the school leavers to register. Like me, several of my hon. Friends have heard constituents' complaints about the matter. We took up the issue with the benefit managers who told us that they were carrying out the instructions of the Government. The Minister is totally wrong; it is not true that the youngsters can register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not true that youngsters can register. They will not be able to do so before October this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
I know that great play is made from time to time of the number of additional training places that are being provided for young people to give them a basis in industrial training. But the Government are at present cutting £77 million from the Manpower Services Commission's training budget and that does not include the £50 million that they are taking from the industry training boards. Far from increasing the money available for training, the Government are cutting it back and in anyone's language, those are fairly substantial cutbacks for training purposes. The Minister knows full well that the apprentice award scheme is also being decimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began his ministerial career by cutting back on the job opportunities programme—I have his parliamentary answer from July 1979, telling me that he would cut it. If he is now increasing the number of places available, he is merely making up for his error then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy of the last two years is that we have seen a massive growth in unemployment, under the guidance, the care, the protection, and sometimes, I feel, the will, of the Secretary of State. We have seen a disaster occur to our young people. I do not think it too dramatic to say that some young people leaving school in Scotland last week and this week are sentenced to a lifetime of unemployment. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that some of them will never be able to find a job and that is not too dramatic a warning to send from this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Highly probable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) says, it is highly probable. Because of the ratio between the number of youngsters and the number of adults, even if the economy were to become buoyant, there is no evidence to show that companies will take on one youngster for every four adults. That never happened, even when the economy was at its best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another dimension to the problem. A number of young people leaving school who would otherwise have learned skills will not do so now because they will not get apprenticeships or training. They will therefore be less likely to find jobs in later life because they will have the benefit neither of real work experience nor of the skills which would encourage employers to take them on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East has made a very fair point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the Government, through their cut in the Manpower Services Commission budget, had decimated the apprentice award scheme. I have heard the Minister say that there has been a high success rate in placing the youngsters who have received that work experience. I believe that the figure is normally 70 per cent. But that means that 30 per cent, of the youngsters do not get placed, and that, too, is a high figure, and represents a tragedy. I do not think it too dramatic to say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
a number of youngsters leaving school now are sentenced by the Government's economic policy which is supported by the Secretary of State, to a lifetime of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have examined the unemployment figures in some detail. Now I come to what has happened to industry. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) mentioned the plant at Blairgowrie that closed before the 1979 general election—four years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the closures that have taken place since the election of 1979: Wiggins Teape at Corpach, Monsanto in Ayrshire, ICI Ardeer; Robb Caledon at Dundee—announced last week; Lin-wood; Massey-Ferguson, Glynwed in Falkirk in my constituency; SGS Electronics in Falkirk, Singer at Clydebank and Goodyear Tyres. The list of closures that have taken place since the Government came into power goes on and on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an Adjournment debate last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) raised the matter of Burroughs. Ministers defend the action of companies. I have never once known the Secretary of State or his junior Minister to condemn a company for a closure. Last week, we heard the Under-Secretary of State reading what many of us described as a company brief from Burroughs, defending the action of Burroughs at Cumbernauld in reducing its work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a major closure is in prospect, Ministers do not try to keep the company going or intervene in order to persuade it not to close; they defend the company. On that score, too, they stand condemmed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that by talking Scotland down, as he and his colleagues do, the hon., Gentleman is damaging to a considerable extent the job prospects in the many new companies that are being brought to Scotland. The hon. Gentleman read a list. I have a list here of companies opening in Scotland. If I pass it to the hon. Gentleman, will he undertake to read every name on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to read every name on the list of companies opening in Scotland. I notice that it is taken from a speaking note on unemployment prepared by the Scottish Office. The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) cannot think for himself. He had a brief this morning from the Scottish Office, and so he will no doubt try to catch your eye, Mr. Henderson. I shall be grateful if you will call the hon. Gentleman, because the Civil Service will be very disappointed if that brief does not appear in the 	<i>Official Report.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However—to be serious—the jobs created by the companies in that list would not, taken together, make up for any one of the closures on the list I have just read out. They would make up for the loss of jobs at Linwood or at Wiggins Teape, or the job loss involved in any other one of the closures I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I did not read the hon. Gentleman's list—I was anxious to return his brief to him in case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
he was called soon after me—I suspect that it refers to Sinclair Electronics, which went to Dundee. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that Sinclair Electronics is a National Enterprise Board company assisted by the Labour Government. It would ill become him to boast about that company, when his right hon. Friend voted against giving it any help at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of companies in Scotland, including Digital Equipment in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, which were helped to establish themselves by the Labour Government. It ill becomes the Secretary of State to criticise the intervention policies of the Labour Government, when we were very helpful in the right hon. Gentleman's own constituency. If the right hon. Gentleman had done as much for the rest of Scotland as we did for his constituency, Scotland would not be in a mess today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, I would be very grateful if he could tell us what is to happen to Scottish Aviation as a result of the defence statement made last Thursday. I am astonished that the right hon. Gentleman did not call a press conference on Friday, as he did on 20 May 1980, to tell us what the consequences of that defence statement will be for Scottish Aviation. I have here a cutting from the 	<i>Evening Times</i> of Monday 19 May 1980, headed, " Younger lifts airport gloom ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cutting tells us how:
	<br><q><p>"A personal intervention by Scottish Secretary George Younger has won a Defence contract worth 700 new jobs for Prestwick.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The RAF are expected shortly to sign a contract for the British Aerospace Jetstream 31 communications aircraft to be built at the former Scottish Aviation plant at Prestwick.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The order was nearly lost to American competitors for the RAF wanted the cheaper King Air aircraft … which has already been developed.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>A Scottish Office spokesman said today: ' Mr. Younger interceded and managed to ensure that the contract stays in Britain'. His ' Buy British' line was fully endorsed by the Cabinet and Air Chiefs were over-ruled.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>" Plans for new communications aircraft have been deferred until the late 1980s."</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Mr. Younger pointed out that such a contract for Prestwick would fully back up the Government's regional policy by creating new jobs in an area of high unemployment."</p></q>
I wrote to the Prime Minister, because I was surprised that the Secretary of State was releasing his Cabinet speeches to the press. I thought that that was a new approach to Cabinet meetings. In a letter dated 9 June 1980, the Prime Minister assured me that the report that had appeared in the press was accurate and that the British Aerospace Jetstream 31 would be built at Scottish Aviation and would replace the communications aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 41 in the Defence White Paper " The Way Forward " states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State tell me now the implication of that comment for Scottish Aviation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter yesterday from the Minister of State for Defence Procurement. I am grateful to the noble Lord for informing me that there is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>135</span>
question of Jetstream aircraft being built at Scottish Aviation until the late 1980s. I should have thought that the Secretary of State, who took the trouble to leak details of the contract to the press in May 1980, would have had the same integrity to call a press conference on Friday and tell those in Scottish Aviation in Prestwick that his promise of May 1980 could not now be fulfilled, and that the 700 jobs that he said will be created will, according to Lord Trenchard, no longer be available. I want to know—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend presently. There is no point in the Secretary of State seeking to divert attention from himself. I want to know why he sought deliberately to cover up that line in the defence White Paper of last Thursday, and why no indication was given to the media in Scotland of its consequences for Scottish Aviation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not answer for the Secretary of State. No doubt inadvertently, my hon. Friend said that there was now no chance of the Jetstream being built by Scottish Aviation. I think that he means that there is now no chance of it getting a defence contract, because, thanks to the initiative of the people at Scottish Aviation in obtaining some commercial contracts, it is being built. I should not want the rumour spread that it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that, on 19 May 1980, the Secretary of State claimed in the Glasgow 	<i>Evening Times</i> that he had been successful in overruling the defence chiefs and having the RAF order placed at Scottish Aviation. I appreciate the anxiety of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), but the fact is that the contract, which the Secretary of State claimed in May 1980 had been won, is, according to Lord Trenchard's letter yesterday, now no longer available. I accuse the Secretary of State of not taking the same trouble to inform the Scottish media and the Scottish Aviation work force that he had deceived them in 1980 over the contract that he claimed to have won for them, as it is now no longer available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have dealt at length with the Scottish Development Agency and Locate in Scotland, but I shall link them together very briefly. What has been happening in the Scottish Development Agency lately has given cause for great concern. It has lost four very good people, and it is now well known inside the agency that Ministers have no time for it and would rather see it disappear altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning, my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) and I wished Locate in Scotland every success, and we still do, because we know that the civil servants responsible for it are anxious to make it work. But that can happen only if Ministers are prepared to show some enthusiasm towards it. Unless the leadership is given by the Secretary of State, I am afraid that Locate in Scotland will suffer the same fate as the Scottish Development Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
I began by a partial examination of the Secretary of State's record. I finish that examination by saying that every time the Secretary of State has gone to the Cabinet he has lost the battle. He lost the battle on Scottish Aviation. On the regional development grants he gave up 20 per cent, of the total United Kingdom savings. When the Welsh Development Agency was receiving £3-8 million more, the Secretary of State for Scotland was giving up £17 million from the Scottish Development Agency. In the present round of local government cuts, the Secretary of State for Scotland has given up 20 per cent, of the United Kingdom total of £500 million. Through the years it has always been the case that, if money was available, the Scottish Office received 10 per cent., and, if savings had to be made, we had to contribute 10 per cent, as well—but not under this Secretary of State. He is prepared to give double what any previous Secretary of State has given. I suspect that if money is available, he will be prepared to accept half what any other Secretary of State receives. Over Nissan-Datsun, the Secretary of State did not even fight. He and his junior Ministers did not even try to get Nissan-Datsun to come to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our gravest charge against the Secretary of State is that he does not even fight. What we need in the Cabinet is a heavyweight, punching his full weight; what we got was a bantamweight who was knocked out in the first round and decided never to fight again. For that, the people of Scotland are the victims, and they will judge him harshly—there can be no doubt about that—at the first available opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Younger)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for the opportunity this morning to discuss what must be by far the most important problem that we face in political life in Scotland now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has entertained us for more than half an hour this morning and has shown his great versatility in these matters. He revealed himself for the first time as a student of Oscar Wilde. I did not know that he was inclined in a literary way. But I wondered whether he had missed the best quotation, to which I thought he would refer— Oscar Wilde's most famous quotation, when he arrived in the United States and said to those receiving him:
	<br><q><p>"I have nothing to declare except my genius."</p></q>
After hearing the hon. Gentleman, I thought that that would have been an extraordinarily appropriate comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only on the literary front has the hon. Gentleman shown his talents this morning. He scored the finest own goal that I have seen in any of our Committee sittings for a long time when he embarked upon a long description of events at British Aerospace and, although he was well aware that I was involved and knew what was going on, forgot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
about his hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who is also involved and knows what he is talking about. I suggest, with respect, that it would have been better to find out the truth of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth is absolutely right. He had a letter from my noble Friend Lord Trenchard a couple of days ago about last week's defence review, as I did. He was perfectly correct in saying that, because of the changes in the defence structure, at the moment there is probably no prospect of the defence order for Jetstreams until at least the end of this decade. However, he failed to inform himself of the fact that British Aerospace at Prestwick would not be able to produce them even if an order were placed, because, thanks to assistance from the Scottish Economic Planning Department, which the company publicly acknowledged played an extremely important part, commercial orders are being received for this aircraft. The company is taking on staff and labour, and the atmosphere in the factory is more optimistic than it has been for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always delighted to have the advice of the hon. Gentleman about what is happening in my constituency, but I suggest that he might like to be better informed. He also spoke at great length about a small point concerning Digital Equipment, which he said was in my constituency. He may care to note that it is in the constituency of his hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. He might get that right as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman leaves this point, could he tell us why in May 1980 he claimed, in an article in the Glasgow 	<i>Evening Times,</i> that he was successful in securing the RAF order for Scottish Aviation, and why in June 1981 he did not think it necessary to tell the Scottish press that the order was no longer available to Scottish Aviation? Is that not important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The claims which the hon. Gentleman read out were not made by me, although they were all true. The change in the defence programme is perfectly well known to the hon. Gentleman and everyone else. The statement was true at the time, and is no longer true because of the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the events of 1974. That was unwise, because he did not check his facts. When the Conservative Government left office, in 1974, I was not at the Scottish Office. I was at the Ministry of Defence. So it was not I who—as he put it—was turfed out of the Scottish Office in 1974. But, supposing that that had occurred—and I am giving the hon. Gentleman every benefit of the doubt. He would have found that on every count of the unemployment statistics, what he was left when the hon. Gentleman took over, compared very favourably with what he left when handed over to us in May 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give him some statistics which he may find useful. Comparing the first quarters of 1974 and 1979—which is a fair comparison, comparing like with like—when the hon. Gentleman took office in 1974, the total of unemployed was 92,600. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
he left office, there were 188,300. The total of unemployed school leavers when he came to office was 1,800, and when he left there were 10,900 unemployed. On the seasonally adjusted figures, there were 84,000 unemployed when he took over, and 169,000 when he left office. The difference between the United Kingdom unemployment rate and the Scottish unemployment rate was 1-4 percentage points when he took over and 1-9 percentage points when he gave up office. Finally, on the notification of redundancies, when he took over they averaged 371 a week and when he left office there were 586 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not just one statistic, culled in order to be clever. That is every single statistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred finally to the three-day week without mentioning that under the Conservative Government the country produced more during the three-day week than when he left office during the winter of discontent in 1979. So the hon. Gentleman is certainly a good person to include in a team if someone is required to score own goals. He is rivalling his hon. Friends and here he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring the Secretary of State up to date in the summer of discontent? Will he remind the Committee of the number unemployed in Scotland today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is just the right person to intervene at this point as the other rival for the crown as the kind of scoring own goals. The hon. Gentleman is right—if he had been here at the beginning, which unfortunately he was not because I am sure that he had been unavoidably detained, he would have heard the discussion about the number at present unemployed. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) worked very hard earlier this morning and described the great vote of confidence that he would have moved had he been allowed to do so, but of course he was not. He spoke to the assembled applause of no fewer than eight Opposition Back Benchers, out of a total of 43. There were also two Opposition Front Bench Members, which was good of them. At that time, there were 18 out of a possible 23 Conservative Members present. That demonstrates the genuine concern that hon. Members feel about this extremely difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a new problem. Unemployment has been mounting steadily for many years. Each peak has been higher than the last. Although successive Governments have done their best to alleviate the problem, they have had only temporary success which has inevitably caused greater damage and yet higher unemployment thereafter. The previous Labour Government were no exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to give the Committee a brief account of what we are doing to combat this extremely difficult problem. I am sure that the Committee will also give its advice during the debate. We have a responsibility to face up to the root causes of this problem. The Government's responsibility,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
which I absolutely accept, is to create the foundations for new and lasting jobs. In doing so, we must do everything possible, to the limits of our resources, to give help to those who are unemployed. But, equally, we must identify and tackle the root causes of unemployment so that this time we create new real jobs without destroying thousands of existing jobs in the process. Let me now describe in more detail how we are providing maximum possible help to those out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to alleviate the worst effects of unemployment, particularly for those most vulnerable. We have given particular priority to the needs of young people and school leavers by expanding substantially the youth opportunities programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I don't. Although I normally give way, if I do so now I shall take far too long, and many hon. Members wish to speak. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acquit me of discourtesy if I continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland in the current year we snail provide places for about 66,000 entrants to the programme, which is an increase of 78 per cent, over the planned level for last year. We have given a strengthened undertaking to 1981 school leavers that we shall offer them suitable places on the programme by Christmas. We have asked the Manpower Services Commission to move towards the position where any 16 or 17-year-old who has been unemployed for three months is offered a place on the programme within a further three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also see that the present levels of unemployment do not erode the skills which are essential to our competitiveness and we must see that more and better training and re-training is carried out so that, when the upturn comes, industry will not lack the skills needed for recovery. Through the Manpower Services Commission we are devoting substantial sums to supporting industry's own efforts to train apprentices, with special emphasis being placed on training for key skills demanded by industry. Under the training opportunities scheme we are also offering major opportunities for adults to learn new skills to meet the changing demands of the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our other main aim is to tackle the root causes of the accelerating unemployment which has dogged us for so long. What are those root causes? The closures and job losses which we have been suffering have almost all been due to either old industries dying off because they have become out of date or more modern industries losing their competitiveness through high costs, poor products, late delivery, or all three. Both these causes have been aggravated by the worst trade recession since the war. The tragic thing is that in most cases the goods produced have not become unnecessary. Others have stepped in to take over our market with better goods, and we even have to import many of them for our own home market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
We must therefore face up to this lack of competitiveness now, late in the day though it is. It is no use finding someone to blame unless we put our house in order. While we blame each other, foreigners are flooding our market with their goods —and our people, unfortunately, are happily buying them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Government's attack on inflation is of such importance. Nothing weakens our competitiveness more than rates of inflation far in excess of our trading partners. But, in parallel with our policy on inflation, we are providing substantial direct support and encouragement for industry. First, we do everything possible—this is the answer to what the hon. Gentleman said earlier—to help any business in difficulty. We use all the means that we have—selective assistance, grants and loans, the SDA and HIDB and any other means which we can in any particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Always where we help we must see a reasonable prospect for a secure future for the undertaking that we help. There is no future for anyone in using scarce public money to back losers. In spite of all the difficulties, we have had a number of important successes. The most notable of these is Weirs—saved almost entirely due to Government backing, but incidentally at very little public expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the real lie is given to the argument that this Government do nothing to support industrial concerns by the financial backing on a huge scale that we have given the nationalised industries to help them restructure and survive in a time of great difficulty. The British Steel Corporation alone has been given financial backing to the tune of over £1,100 million last year and £730 million this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant that we pay British Rail under the public services obligation is now £645 million—a rise of 12 per cent, in real terms since we took office. For the future, BR has been asked, as was announced last week, to put forward a 10-year programme of rail electrification schemes for the Government to consider. I am delighted that large sums—over £150 million last year alone—have also been made available to British Shipbuilders to restructure the company, to which we have also given substantial support in the form of ordering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth mentioning that last week's defence announcements—if it had been another way, I know certain hon. Gentlemen would have made the most they could of it—were uniquely steered to be helpful wherever possible to Scotland, giving Scotland more jobs on the Trident programme and specifically looking after the yards at Yarrows and Hall Russell. This Government make their activity felt and make sure that, where they can place orders to help development areas, they do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all welcome the orders for Hall Russell, but it got them because it is an efficient and competitive yard, and not because of any handouts from the Secretary of State or anybody else. Therefore, I hope that he will not take anything away from the splendid work force in that yard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could not have put the case that I have been trying to get across this morning better. Of course it will get more orders if it remains competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point of main strategy in dealing with this problem surely lies of encouraging indigenous industry to modernise and expand wherever possible. We are encouraging industry to produce new products and improve manufacturing processes through science and technology Act grants, in which great interest has been shown. We are, of course, maintaining grants, loans and selective assistance and concentrating them in the areas of greatest need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The West Scotland special development area is the largest in the United Kingdom and, together with Dundee and the new towns, has the highest level of aid in the country. This aid is not subject to cash limits, however difficult cash problems become. It is still the case that no project which has a good prospect of viability has ever been turned down because of lack of money to give it Government support. That is a true measure of the priority that we are giving to our own domestic industries to preserve jobs and develop their business. Examples of this will be known to many, but I mention only a few—John Brown Engineering, Barr and Stroud, British Aerospace, Babcocks, Low and Bonar, Howdens, Redpath de Groot Caledonian, and so on. This must be only a small selection of the list which my hon. Friend, I am sure, hopes to mention if he catches your eye, Mr. Henderson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third main aim of the strategy is the attraction of new inward investment from overseas to replace the jobs that we have lost, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned briefly. There was a time when some said that this was not desirable as it would take away labour and markets from local industry, but I doubt whether many take that view now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has been very successful since the war in attracting foreign investment, but in recent years there has been a growing feeling that our effort was too fragmented and that we were in some important respects losing out to our competitors in other countries. This feeling culminated in the decision of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs to look into the matter and, after taking evidence from many sources, it produced a most useful report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of my consideration of this report, I recently put our whole inward investment effort on a new footing by concentrating it in the Locate in Scotland Bureau. The LIS comprises both SEPD and SDA staff and will, by leading and co-ordinating the promotion activity of other bodies, provide at last a " one-door" approach—a total package of Government grants, financial services, sites and premises and comprehensive advice in response to every inquiry from an overseas investor planning to bring jobs to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely this kind of concerted effort by the various bodies involved which has recently enabled Scotland to land, for example, the new Rockwell Valves project and the expansion of Gray Tool, together expected to provide some 400 jobs at East Kilbride. These two companies, incidentally, are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
heavily involved in oil-related work. North Sea oil activities continue to be a major growth sector. Some 80 to 90,000 jobs have been created and we currently have six rig and platform yards in operation. Moreover, within the next 24 hours or so, Conoco is expected to announce the award of the order for the world's first tension leg platform. The indications are that Scottish yards could be given the opportunity to be in at the start of this new and exciting technology. I see no reason why the oil-related sector of our industry should not profit from the oil developments now taking place worldwide in the waters of 90 countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we are continuing to provide special services and support for small businesses. Most recently, the Chancellor announced a new business opportunities programme in Glasgow, aimed at securing stronger financial support for setting up and maintaining small businesses. Through this Programme we are improving tax incentives for investing in certain types of small firm—thereby dealing with the so-called " equity gap "—and we are helping small firms secure loan funds through the loan guarantee scheme. This has been operating for only a month but already has attracted numerous enquiries and the first loans have already been made— not bad going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small businesses are of particular importance in areas affected by the rundown of traditional industries; we are giving further encouragement to their creation in such areas through measures such as the Clydebank task force and enterprise zone, the Glengarnock task force, and the new enterprise trust, ASSET, in North Ayrshire. In Clydebank, with the inception of the task force there have been 650 enquiries from companies interested in establishing themselves there, of which 200 appear to be seriously interested; 14 companies have already moved into the area and 8 have firm plans to do so in the near future; and these companies alone will create some 400 new jobs over the next three years. The task force's activities in Glengarnock have led to the creation of 300 jobs over the past two years, with a further 500 in prospect. At BSC Industry's Clyde workshops some 500 new jobs have been created in 70 such businesses with further expansion in prospect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these growing initiatives that the hon. Gentleman has recited are made possible because of public organisations, such as the British steel industry or the Scottish Development Agency, an organisation that the Under-Secretary of State responsible for industry and education spares no opportunity to decry or further devalue. If the Scottish Development Agency had not existed, many of these initiatives could not have taken place because the framework would not have been available for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is working purely on mythology. Not only have the Government supported the SDA but it had more money to spend last year than it ever had before and more than was ever given to it by the Opposition. The SDA has put its affairs in order and is reorganising

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
itself under a good new management. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning's debate has followed on from last week's debate on the Floor of the House which dealt effectively with the issues on a United Kingdom basis. I have tried this morning to spell out the way in which we in Scotland are tackling the most difficult industrial crisis we have faced since the war. However, I have been disappointed to find that no concrete effort has been made by the Opposition to put forward an alternative policy. I find that highly depressing, because a good Opposition should be able to put forward alternative policies as well as criticising the Government of the day. I think that the hon. Gentleman failed lamentably this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for "Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) last week called for a massive programme of public spending to put right all the evils of the various difficulties faced in Scotland. It is as if that had not been tried 10 times before in the last 30 years. Anyone who embarked upon any such course today would really need to have his head examined. Every time it has been tried in the past, it has ended in higher inflation and more job losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a policy was specifically rejected by the former Labour Prime Minister in a memorable speech to the Labour Party conference in 1977, and it has been implicity rejected by the present Opposition Treasury spokesman. The cost of financing such a massive programme could come only from higher interest rates if the money were borrowed, or from higher taxes if it were not borrowed. Who, in industry, calls for either of those changes today? Not one person. That is the answer to the non-policy, which the Opposition have once again totally failed to put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Opposition who fail to put forward an alternative is an Opposition who do not expect to have the chance to run the Government. That is the trouble that the present Opposition are in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case there is any doubt, I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) passed me some speaking notes on unemployment that had been handed out to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Handed out by whom? That is my point. That is the job of the Scottish Conservative Party, not that of the Scottish Office. I have already disregarded your instructions, Mr. Henderson, by beginning with a red herring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the Secretary of State for Scotland for indulging in the same practice as that of the Prime Minister, which is reading out long lists of orders received by firms throughout the country. It would be a sad state of affairs if there were no new orders. We must not allow either the right hon. Gentleman's rhetoric or that of the Prime Minister to disguise what has happened to the economy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there is considerable evidence that the world-wide recession is ending, the United Kingdom is showing little signs of recovery—if one ignores the Government's rhetoric and listens to what independent forecasters say. For example, the latest quarterly review of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has predicted that real gross domestic product will rise in the United States next year by 2 per cent, and by about 2.7 per cent, in the OECD countries as a whole. That is in marked contrast to predictions published recently for the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forecasts published at the end of May by the National Institute, the CBI and Phillips and Drew all predict that economic activity is likely to be broadly flat next year with at best only a small recovery in 1982. Those three forecasts predict that real gross domestic product will fall by an average of 2 1/2 per cent. this year before rising by only 1/2 per cent. in 1982. I think that that picture is far grimmer and I have no evidence to suggest that the Scottish economy is any different from that of the United Kingdom as a whole, to which those figures relate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to produce a balanced picture to the Committee, would it not be appropriate to quote the latest projections of the London Business School which predicts that output will be up, consumption up, money supply down, inflation down, the PSBR down and unemployment beginning to steady off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read that report in the press either yesterday or today, but the press commentators also pointed out that it was out of line with the other three reports that I have mentioned. I think that the general view among people who have no cause to be particularly antagonistic to the present Government is not as optimistic and as rosy as the speeches of Government Ministers would suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, let us leave aside the lack of uptake in the economy and look simply at the figures relating to inflation. I remind the Committee that after the Government came to office the Financial Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
introduced a new index called the tax and prices index by which inflation could be measured more accurately. He said that that gave a better indication of changes in total household costs than the retail prices index alone. On the index that gives the Government's more accurate figure, the present rate of inflation is not the frequently quoted 12 per cent., but 15-7 per cent. It is interesting to note that as that index has gone wrong it is no longer published with the same fanfare of trumpets that it received a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record is pretty disastrous on inflation, economic growth and unemployment. Unemployment in Scotland has increased from 8 per cent, to 12-7 per cent. What is the immediate future prospect? There are nearly 55,000 school leavers this month and the Scottish CBI has already estimated that half of them will not have found a job by next year. That is a dramatic and dismal prospect for our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures relate to Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole and I should like to spend a few minutes giving the Committee a picture of what is happening in the Borders. As there are, if, the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will forgive me, only one and a half Members of Parliament in the region, we do not often look at its economic problems. However the picture there is very depressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one and three-quarters Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry I had forgotten that the hon.

Member does not represent even a half in Berwick and East Lothian. But we are a united trio on the particular issued concerning the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1966 to 1979 Governments of both persuasions were committed to the industrial regeneration of the Borders region. That had been so successful that between 1972 and 1978 the region's population had grown by 3,000. However, the registrar-general estimates that since then more than 1,000 people have left and there is a clear indication that the old rot of depopulation, against which we had to campaign so strongly in the early 1960s, may have set in again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housebuilding programme of the region is another indication of that. In the 10 years up to 1971, the average number of houses constructed was about 340. That increased to 560 and, from 1972 to 1978 the number reached 720 a year. But in the past two years the rate of construction of new houses has declined dramatically to just over 200 a year. That is because of the lack of support for the economy in the area, the rundown in the SSHA programme, the inactivity of the SDA and the withdrawal of development area status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1968–78 about 120 new firms came into the Borders. That was a remarkable success. It showed the co-operation of the Government with local government. From 1976-80 jobs in the region increased by about 900. Unfortunately, that con
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
ceals a decrease of 400 jobs in the past two years, so that the net increase is only 500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, for the first time in the Borders region there is a high level of unemployment. It is still below the Scottish average—the last monthly figure was 7-8 per cent.—but it has doubled within a year through a combination of a lack of public investment, lack of economic activity, the start of depopulation and a doubling of unemployment in a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a pretty grim picture from one small part of Scotland, but I believe that it is a mirror of what is happening in Scotland as a whole. There is no room for complacency when one looks at the prospect of all the good work done by Labour and Conservative Governments over the past 15 years being destroyed in a relatively short time by the extraordinary doctrinaire policies of the present Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Gentleman about the problems of the Borders. I have been there several times to see what they are. However, if the unemployment rate in the Borders is about half that in Strathclyde does the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not and never has been my argument. My argument is that the insidious disease in the Borders is depopulation. It has been exported unemployment. What worries me is not just that the crude unemployment figure has doubled in the year—I accept that it is still below the Scottish average and well below that of Strathclyde—but combined with a re-start of depopulation it is a serious matter which ought to have Government attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the Secretary of State's visits to the area and I am grateful for them, but I hope that he will note the strong pleas from the local authorities in the area for the development area review to be accelerated. Even if we can hang on to the intermediate status after 1982, it would be immensely valuable. But if the review is not to take place until next summer, another year will be lost in which it will be difficult to get new firms to come into our region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Secretary of State said this morning about the Locate in Scotland Bureau. I hope that that co-ordinated approach will be more successful. But the Borders must be able to compete for the smaller firms. The area has transport difficulties and we shall not be able to compete for those small firms if they are sucked into areas that offer massive incentive to development. If the Secretary of State is not careful, although the unemployment figure may stagger along at below the Scottish average, he will be responsible for accelerating depopulation once again in my area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Member leaves the Borders, may I put it to him that the damage in terms of uncertainty has already been done as a result of the loss of development area

status in the Borders? May I remind him about the meetings that he and I had last year with the Secretary of State for Scotland and with the Under-Secretary of State for Industry? It became abundantly clear that the Secretary of State for Scotland had practically no say in the question of development area status in the Borders and that the Under-Secretary of State for Industry was not particularly interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that a great deal of damage has been done already. In particular, the new firms that came into the area while it was a development area in many cases came in with the option of expansion. There was land adjacent to their factories and they were ready to double or treble, as had been the steady pattern from the 1960s. That has been destroyed. Those firms came in with the expectation that there would be certain grants and allowances available to go on expanding their businesses and those are now withdrawn. One or two of the new firms have folded up and left the area. I deeply regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making this warning cry now because if we allow another year to go by without a change in Government policy, the position in the Borders will be very seriously and adversely affected and the results of the good work done over 15 years will be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final words will be, again, on the national scene. The Government must think again about the emphasis on money control as the sole implement of economic policy. At a time of high unemployment, there is much force behind the argument for ending the employer's national insurance surcharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also consider capital spending in industry. The Department of Industry's own survey shows that spending in the manufacturing sector fell by 10 per cent, in 1980 and that it is expected to fall by a further 16 per cent, during the current year. That shows that there is a serious lack of investment in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I have therefore urged the Government to engage not in massive increases in public expenditure across the board, such as the Secretary of State has denounced, but in selective forward investment in the public sector in areas where it will produce contracts for the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious, for example, that the telephone system is deteriorating. Anyone in London who tries to dial parts of Scotland finds that the failure rate is increasing year by year. There is a need to spend there. There is a need, too, to get on with the electrification programme and avoid the exchange of a great deal of paper between the Government and British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also necessary to stimulate investment in the offshore technologies, in electronics and, in particular, in energy conservation. We should give incentives now to induce industry to invest in energy conservation techniques, so as to achieve a real reduction in energy use by 1990. Such an investment programme would create jobs in the short run and benefit the country in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
The Government's economic policy will continue to limp along while they use unemployment as a weapon in the argument about wage bargaining. I think that they will find themselves driven more and more—as we see week by week now—towards an incomes policy. It would be far better for them to accept the need for a strategy for incomes and consider the matter globally, rather than to put the civil servants in the dock or make speeches and sermons about the wage levels expected next year. Without an incomes strategy from the Government, the weight of the Government's policies will fall contnually on the unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Sproat 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to direct my remarks to the central reasons for our tragic unemployment in Scotland, and to say something about what more we could do in addition to what my right hon. Friend has already outlined that we are doing to combat unemployment and to restore high employment and high prosperity to our country. But before I turn to the central causes of unemployment, I would like to mention two peripheral but important aspects of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the international comparisons have hardly been mentioned today and, indeed, were hardly mentioned last Wednesday on the Floor of the House by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley), who opened and closed the debate for the Opposition. There are also the comparisons with the 1930 which are made so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who looks at the unemployment figures for trie world's developed countries, including ourselves, will he struck by two things. First, unemployment is extremely high in almost all the developed countries of the world, with one or two exceptions. That point has not been made by Labour Members. Indeed, not only have Labour Members in the Committee and in the House ignored that point, but Mr. Len Murray, barracking the Prime Minister in Europe yesterday, had the nerve to say that the unemployment figure of 2-6 million was the result solely of the Government. He totally ignored the very high unemployment rates in other countries of the EEC and other developed countries not in the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which springs undeniably from any comparison with international rates, is that the United Kingdom, although it does not have the highest unemployment rate among developed countries, certainly has a very high rate. Agreeing that much of our unemployment has been caused by the world recession and is therefore shared by the majority of other developed countries, one factor has obtained in the United Kingdom—not only now, but alas, for about 20 years. As my right hon. Friend said, every recession that we have suffered in this country has seen a higher peak of unemployment and unemployment figures have fallen less low than they did the previous time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are discussing not something which has happened only in the past two years under this Government but something to which both the world
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
recession and our performance over the past 20 years have greatly contributed. I am sorry that Opposition Members so often forget to mention those two extremely important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second comparison that I find is all too often made by the Opposition—as opposed to the international comparison which is too rarely made—is that with the 1930s. At least the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) did not dwell on that comparison at great length, but no doubt we shall hear of it—we have certainly done so in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without seeking either to deny or to diminish the gravity of the problem facing us in Scotland— and the United Kingdom—in no way can the circumstances of 1981 be compared fairly with the circumstances of the 1930s. Apart from anything else, the comprehensive system of unemployment benefits and social security benefits which we have—thank goodness—now, means that the average man, in the average family, with an average rent, will, when he becomes unemployed, start with about £66-70 a week tax free. That may not be a great deal of money, but he is certainly not on the poverty line. In addition, he would also be eligible for one-off cash benefits: cash payments to help with repairs, heating costs, children's clothing and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we turn to the central issue of the causes of unemployment, it is extremely important to get into perspective the true position as it obtains in Scotland today. Without the correct perspective, we shall not find the correct solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is the case, as the hon. Gentleman says, that unemployment is due in part to world recession, and if there is a fault that has been evident for over 20 years, would he not agree that the Saatchi and Saatchi advertisement of the dole queues before the last election were totally dishonest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course they were not dishonest. They said " Labour is not working " and Labour was not working. The Government are trying to put right not only what was wrong under the last Labour Government but—let us admit it frankly—what was not done correctly under previous Conservative Governments. At least we have the honesty to admit that, what our party did in the past was not sufficient. It is self-evident: One cannot say that it was sufficient if today there are 2-6 million unemployed and over 300,000 unemployed in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly what Saatchi and Saatchi drafted so excellently for us to say was undeniably true and I think that it opened people's eyes to something of the true causes of unemployment. They felt that something must be done about unemployment and they did it by voting the Conservative Party into power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the central core of what I wish to say. If we are to restore high employment and high prosperity, it is essential to recognise the real cause of unemployment in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom above and beyond the causes of world recession. That cause, above all, is that industry in the United Kingdom and in Scotland is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
increasingly uncompetitive. It is not two years of Government under my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that is to blame for unemployment; it is over 20 years under both parties of growing uncompetitiveness as a result of restrictive practices by the trade unions, lacklustre management, lack of investment and the policies of Governments of both parties, who for too long have sheltered management and unions from the full consequences of their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anybody doubts how Scottish—and British— industry has become increasingly less competitive in the world, he has only to study the speech made earlier this month by Mr. Gordon Richardson, the Governor of the Bank of England. Before any hon. Members from Dundee or the Western Isles ask what the Governor of the Bank of England has to do with it, I should say that I put his points to the Scottish CBI, which said that they applied almost exactly in Scotland as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw three points in the Governor's speech to the Committee's attention, having admitted in a bipartisan spirit that my party—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I thought that I ought to get a smile out of Labour Members, after the Oscar Wilde of the Opposition Front Bench had entertained us so well earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that both sides of the Committee should engage their attention on these three points. First, over the past two years United Kingdom wages have gone up 40 per cent., while the wages of our industrial rivals have gone up only 12 per cent. In the United Kingdom, for every two units of output that we have produced, our industrial rivals have produced three units of equivalent value. In the United Kingdom in the last 10 years wages have gone up 335 per cent., while output has gone up only 16 per cent. The difference between that rise in wages and the sadly not corresponding rise in output lies at the heart of our lack of competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may weary the Committee with one other important set of statistics. I am afraid that when matters are important, they do weary the Opposition, because they do not want to look at what is truly important. If we are to understand why this country has suffered the loss of jobs and how that loss is connected to loss of competitiveness, it is important to realise that in the past five years— which include what this Government have done as well as what the last Government did—United Kingdom unit costs have risen by 88 per cent., in the United States they have gone up by only 36 per cent., in West Germany they have gone up by only 17 per cent, and in Japan they have gone up by zero per cent. Those figures on their own show why this country has become increasingly uncompetitive. In the light of those figures it is impossible to deny that Scottish industry as well as that of the rest of the United Kingdom has become increasingly uncompetitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Douglas) said something about lack of investment being part of the reason. I agree, and we have to consider why there has been a lack of investment. Many factors have produced this tragic situation, but one major factor which is least mentioned by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
those shouting most loudly about the tragedy of unemployment is the contribution of restrictive practices by trade unions to the loss of jobs. It is not the only factor, but it is one of the major domestic factors. The sad truth is that the actions of trade unions over the years have most harmed those whom they have claimed to protect. Abuse of power by the trade unions followed by weak responses from Governments of both parties on too many occasions is the major domestic reason for the lack of investment and loss of jobs in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to explain why, if the trade unions have so much power, in 1979 and 1980 2,700 establishments in Scotland visited by the wages inspectors were found to be underpaying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the hon. Member to make his own speech. I am covering this whole matter as I go along. In shorthand, succinctly, the reason why high wages cannot be paid is often because there is not enough profit and because restrictive practices have made us uncompetitive. That is why we have not been able to sell our goods. Our loss of competitiveness has led to the sad position of Scottish and British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the trade unions have most harmed their own members by demanding wages out of all proportion to production, by grotesque overmanning, by restrictive practices of the most idiotic sorts, such as in the infamous Hunters-ton dispute in 1979, and by the refusal to accept and encourage new technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one example of how backward we are becoming in Scotland as a whole, in Japan at present about 7,000 robots are working industrially. In the United Kingdom we do not have 7,000 but 371. In Scotland we have only eight robots. My hon. Friends talk about the robots on Opposition Benches. I think that they are probably referring more to puppets than to robots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members want to try to deny the harmful effect that certain trade union practices have had on unemployment, we do not have to look at what has happened in the past. We may look at the Manpower Services Commission which is currently flooding Scotland and the United Kingdom with advertisements saying " Out of little acorns great oaks grow." Yet the Manpower Services Commission, which in that advertisement is promoting the youth opportunities programme, is prevented from taking any YOP entrants itself by the trade unions—by the CPSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let any Opposition Member who seeks to justify the action of the trade unions try to justify the trade union concerned stopping the MSC trying to take on recruits from the YOP. That latest example is typical of what we have had to put up with. I hope that the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) when he comes to wind up will at least denounce the trade unions for that kick in the face to all young people in Scotland looking for a chance to get work experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
For years the attitudes of the trade unions, among other factors, have led to our present crisis. Now they are trying to blame that crisis on everyone but themselves. The irony is that this is the first Government for many years that are clearly and directly trying to deal with the harmful effects of restrictive practices and lacklustre management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the usual solutions—they were not put forward this morning, as my right hon. Friend said, because the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth put forward no solutions—we do not have to look in a crystal ball to see what happens as a result, for example, of a general reflation. The Labour Government from 1977-78 and 1978-79 spent about £3^ billion. What did they get for that £3^ billion—150,000 jobs throughout the United Kingdom as a whole. So even if we had the money and even if we were prepared to tax, borrow or print, which we are not, it would not solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the other much-canvassed solution of import controls. About 32 per cent, of our gross domestic product goes on exports, and it would be criminal insanity to put tariff barriers on others who would immediately retaliate. We should lose thousands more jobs by such a method than we have already lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall close by saying what I should like to see done by the Government in addition to the fight against inflation—which is the key, as my right hon. Friend mentioned. About 900,000 jobs have been supported by the present Government, who have spent £1 billion on such job support. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that, in additon, we must bring in fresh legislation to curb trade union abuse, particularly in the areas of the closed shop and the financial immunity of the trade unions. I hope that my right hon. Friend will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to encourage the Government to continue down the road of individual tax cuts and to stick to its promise to have a 25 per cent, standard rate of income tax before the next election. Tax cuts have a great effect on individual incentive and company production. One only has to look at the remarkable experiment in the Henry Lloyd group of companies in Manchester, which produces some of the best industrial protective clothing in this country. They decided that their employees would pay no income tax—that the company would pay their income tax for them. As a result production went up, and has stayed up, by no less than 22.5 per cent. That is an example of how tax cuts can provide incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that we can get a comprehensive simplification of the corporate tax structure, because there is no doubt that far too much time in far too many companies is spent in finding ways to avoid paying the maximum amount of taxation to the Government. Far too much time of finance directors and board members and counsel is spent on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that we can provide some new financial incentives and possibly some new tax set-offs to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
the new sunrise industries of microtechnology, biotechnology, fibre optics and so on. Lastly, I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to control the ludicrous rate rises that certain local authorities have imposed, which are driving industry out of our cities and towns. If Opposition Members think that it cannot be done in Scotland they need only look at the splendid example of Grampian, which, in spite of the burdens of North Sea oil, has managed to keep its rise down to 13 per cent., or even to Southend—where they have had a rate cut of 1.17 per cent. by privatisation of their refuse collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless and until we defeat inflation, and restore our competitiveness, we shall not achieve the high employment and high prosperity for our country that we all seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Braw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell and Wishaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee is agreed that the appalling levels of unemployment in Scotland are mainly due to national circumstances. The Opposition are clear that the position has been greatly exacerbated by national policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the country as a whole, unemployment at 10.6 per cent. is one of the highest in the world amongst industrial countries. In Scotland it is 12-6 per cent. In North Lanarkshire—in which my constituency lies—and its travel-to-work area, unemployment is 20 per cent. In Motherwell and Wishaw last month, unemployment in just one month, and before the school leavers were included, increased by one-eighth, and in Craigneuk and Forgewood in my constituency, before the inclusion of this year's school leavers, unemployment among 16 to 18-year olds is already over 60 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members hope that there is someone left in the House who both understands and believes in the Government's economic policy—I do not think that there is anyone. In a paper to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday Treasury officials made the astonishing statement—after the Government had maintained that their strategy is based on controlling the money supply, and that thereafter incomes, prices and output will follow—that:
	<br><q><p>" increases in nominal public expenditure can only be accommodated by the reduction in other forms of nominal expenditure."</p></q>
In other words, Treasury officials are now saying that the Government are controlling the total of income. We see the consequences in the Government's attitude to the Civil Service pay strike, public expenditure cuts, and the rest. We can ask the Secretary of State to lead rather than to follow in the fight against further public expenditure cuts in the discussions that will take place in Cabinet, but we all know that it will be a hopeless request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the national picture, we are equally clear that however enlightened the policies of a future Government may be, there will be a problem in Scotland and in many of our individual constituencies from the circumstances from which we all suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In meetings with my hon. Friends, Mr. Ian MacGregor, chairman of the British Steel Corporation, and Dr. George Matthewson, chief executive of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
Scottish Development Agency, both stressed that there was a positive need in present circumstances to boost business education in Scotland. I wish to make practical suggestions this morning because I think that we have a hopeless job in trying to convince the Government of the error of their wider ways. Mr. MacGregor and Dr. Matthewson suggested that it would be useful if Scotland had a link with a top business school in America. They suggested the Stanford business school, which is the top school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the Minister responsible for education and industry that I was visiting Stanford and would speak in the business school. He made the reasonable suggestion that as well as seeking a link with Scotland, I should specifically seek a link with the Scottish Business School. Dean Holbrook in the Stanford Business School said that the suggestion of a link with Scotland was timely, because Stanford was wrapping up its link with the European business school in Versailles, which it had not found entirely fruitful. It is seeking fresh overseas links in Europe and Japan and it wants those links to have a research, teaching and consulting base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific suggestion was made in our discussions that as well as starting an executive programme for senior business executives between Stanford and the Scottish Business School, we might think also in terms of a workshop on the stage of development of corporate strategy where a corporation is moving from simply exporting overseas to operating overseas. That is of great interest to the Americans, not only because of their own extensive experience of operating overseas, but because they are becoming worried about Japanese competition, and the need to induct Japan into an equal partnership in the development of the world economy. In Scotland we are interested in obtaining Japanese investment, but I am afraid that the Government have not been active or entirely successful in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has much experience to offer of how to handle overseas development and properly integrate it with the life of the local community, both positively and negatively. We need to cover the financing of overseas operations in rapidly changing exchange rate regimes—no one imagines that the present regime will last for long—industrial relations as perceived by foreigners, business strategy for microelectronic production, the impact of offshore oil on the industrial hinterland, the influence on industrial cultures of economic ideas and industrial history, and how to trade without domination. That last point is of great importance to the electronics and motor industries in Scotland, and of equal importance to the Americans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Scottish Office will be as positive as the Scottish Business School has been in its response to those discussions. I hope that a joint activity will develop between Stanford and the Scottish Business School.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the question whether we have the organisation right in Scotland today. In the present appalling financial stringency in universities, the question is bound to be raised whether it is sensible to divide the limited funds for business education
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
among three and, now, five universities. The feeling is widespread that the arrangements for the Scottish Business School were an uneasy compromise in which the Scottish universities insisted in dividing up the available funds among them rather than concentrating them into a viable unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is plenty of room for separate teaching at the undergraduate level in business studies in a number of Scottish universities and, indeed, for associated post-graduate research within the particular skills of the professorial and other teaching staff engaged in undergraduate teaching. But for graduate teaching and for executive programmes it seems that we need to ask whether a merger into a single institution is not needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the matter with the principal of Edinburgh university, Dr. Burnett, who assured me in a letter that regular discussions take place. He thinks that it is more economical to run the Scottish Business School in the present form rather than to concentrate its activities into a single institution. But unfortunately, that letter was written before he received a letter setting out the cuts from which the Scottish universities are about to suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that we shall be able to look for some positive initiatives in business education. However, I think that we need more local initiatives. There have been local initiatives as, both my hon. Friend for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and the Secretary of State mentioned, in Clydebank, Garnoch, Ayrshire and so on. There has been a recent new project in Leith on which I congratulate the Scottish Development Agency which has brought together the Lothian regional council and the city of Edinburgh district council in a joint venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), councillor Tom Clarke in Monklands and myself with my constituents in Motherwell have all been trying to develop, what inevitably in our circumstances has been, largely voluntary activity in support of industrial development. I think that we all feel that those need effective support from the executive agencies. Because of the interest of the BSC Industry we have been fortunate in having a joint venture between BSC Industry and the Motherwell district councillor Mr. Keith Eaton who has worked extremely efficiently at the intimate grass roots level with individual, small and larger enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BSC Industry and the Scottish Development Agency have had talks with the four district councils, Motherwell, Monklands, Hamilton and Clydesdale to see whether a project can be put forward embracing all four of the districts and the parliamentary constituencies contained therein. I believe that that is a necessary development. The project will be on a much larger scale covering about 800,000 people or more and so, easily, it would be the biggest local effort in Scotland. But I think that we are an industrial unit. We all travel to work in each other's districts and it would be sensible to pursue industrial development within that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
I hope that if this proposal comes forward, as I believe it will, by voluntary local commitment, it will be supported at least as fully by the Scottish Office, as the local initiatives have been, and that we shall not be starved of resources for the modest, but cost effective, work that can be done at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

When minority parties—while they have the right to speak —are allowed two speakers, I think that it is totally intolerable that the majority party is allowed only one Back Bench speaker. I ask you, Mr. Henderson, to bear that fact in mind before you call the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) who represents the Scottish National Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. It is a difficult problem. As the hon. Member says, time is short and we should continue the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Henderson. I have the impression that when an hon. Member rises it is because he wants to catch the Chairman's eye. On page three of the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> of 29 June the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) made a statement headed by the newspaper " Criticism over SDA " and asserts that at our meeting this morning he will attack the Government for
	<br><q><p>" its smothering of the Scottish Development Agency ".</p></q>
He goes on and on about it.

If that is so, is it right that hon. Members who rise should not catch your eye, Mr. Henderson, particularly when minority parties get your attention and are given an opportunity to speak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am able to perceive that the hon. Member has raised an interesting point, but what is in a newspaper is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

attack the Government in this Committee. I understand that the rules of the Committee are that an hon. Member may not rise and speak unless he is fortunate enough to catch the Chairman's eye. Therefore, is it right that an hon. Member should issue such a press release?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason why the Chair will call an hon. Member is if he catches the Chairman's eye.

Every time I rise to speak these days I seem to be preceded by points of order. All I can say about the remarks in the article, which I have not seen, is that I am entitled to indicate what I should like to say about certain matters and if that is covered by the press I think that I am fortunate. Perhaps the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is envious because he cannot achieve that coverage. However, that will not stop me from saying what I intended to say about the Scottish Development Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first crucial point is that unemployment in Scotland has been increasing over a long period. Between 1974 and 1981 it has increased more than three fold. That suggests that the different regional policies tried in the past in relation to growth centres have proved to be insufficient and inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, apart from London and the South-East, unemployment has increased. If there is to be greater pressure on spreading regional incentives to those areas where there is now more unemployment than formerly, pressure on the allocation of resources will increase. Scotland may find that it ceases to have priority claims on help and assistance unless we as Scottish Members can exert equivalent or greater pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday a great cry of joy went up from Coventry when Talbot announced that £10 million would be invested in new models or transfer of production to Ryton. At a time when Linwood has been shut and thousands of jobs have been lost in Scotland, 200 jobs will be secured for Coventry in a part of England which, I accept, has been badly affected by the increase in unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it behoves us all to take a fairly cool look at the whole industrial scene in Scotland. Some of the problems which are arising, possibly from the Civil Service strike or from the Government's actions, will not help. There seems to be evidence that some young people leaving school are not getting national insurance numbers and consequently they may find it difficult to take up jobs, because employers are not necessarily prepared to accept letters from the DHSS saying that matters will be looked at. I direct the Ministers' attention to that specific point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the speeches we have heard so far that industrial regeneration or regional revival or development—call it what we will—cannot
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
operate in isolation from economic policy. Unless there are correct economic policies and a warm climate to provide for growth, the regional attempts to improve and develop industry will fall by the wayside. It involves swimming against the current and however many examples the Government can produce of cases in which the Scottish Economic Planning Department or the Scottish Development Agency have succeeded in bringing in new industry, there are many others in which job opportunities have been lost because of the frigid economic climate and the decline in existing jobs when factories close or make men redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other cases in which new enterprises might have come along, but they have been discouraged from starting when there is substantial difficulty within the overall climate. The Government cannot get away with the suggestion that one can ignore interest rates, the value of the currency, the high fuel costs affecting industrialists, the cutbacks in public expenditure, the fall in consumer demand and the consequent decline in the capital goods market. All those elements have an essentially corrosive effect on the development of any economy. There is a cycle of decline with which it would be difficult for any industry in Scotland to contend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland needs an indigenous economic policy as any attempt at Westminster has failed. It has been admitted over the past 20 to 25 years that the policies adopted in the past have just not been working and it is certainly true that the claim that used to made about having a voice in Cabinet also seems not to work any more in relation to obtaining work for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in the press that according to the first return from the census the population of Scotland may have fallen by about 2 per cent. If the evidence for decline and decay is needed, it will be found when the population begins falling in such a manner. That is an extension of what the right hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be the only example of an oil-producing and exporting country with such a rate of unemployment. There is no restriction on the input which the Government can make to the economy of Scotland which is on its knees and suffering from acute economic starvation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another contention I would like to raise is that we all have to examine how regional policy will be developed because although there was a period during the 1950s and 1960s, when one had only to go out and cry the attractions of Scotland to be overwhelmed by the number of new industries coming in, that is no longer the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland will be affected by cut-throat competition from other parts of the Western world and other parts of the United Kingdom. There will be pleas from different areas for differential help, and that will have an impact on Scotland itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without any acrimony, I say to the Labour Opposition that as, during five years, some of the regional policies they believed in did not work, it is essential for them too, as a possible future Government, to formulate new ideas for enabling Scotland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
to benefit from increased help. The selective scheme of aid which took the place of regional employment premium proved not to be successful from Scotland's point of view, and I think that the abolition of REP did considerable damage to the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the Third Reading of the Scottish Development Agency (No.2) Bill on 21 October 1975, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, now Lord Ross of Marnock, said:
	<br><q><p>"I think that in the Agency we have a means of finding a longer-term solution for a comprehensive and coordinated attack on the deep-seated structural problems of the economy."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 21 October 1975; Vol. 898, c. 399.]</p></q>
Six years later, it is clear that whatever claims we can make for the agency or whatever criticisms we may make of it, the SDA has not filled the role set out for it by the then Secretary of State. It is difficult to say whether the cause is lack of money, bureaucracy within the agency, restrictions in the guidelines or frustration. There is no doubt, however, that the SDA has failed to make the impact we all wanted it to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resignations of four senior members of the SDA suggest that within the agency there must be considerable confusion over what it intends to do. The fact that some of the controls have now passed back to the Civil Service, as is shown by the way in which the appointment for control of the Locate in Scotland Bureau was made, gives added point to my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to say that there is no truth in the rumour that the Highlands and Islands Development Board will be merged with the SDA, as has been suggested. I think that such a merger would be nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no overall planning in the economic management of Scotland's industrial affairs. In Dundee, for example, where unemployment has increased to a substantial degree and the Robb Caledon shipyard is to have its throat ruthlessly cut by British Shipbuilders, the Government— regardless of the local problems that will result— refuse to step in with any advance orders for the yard or any help such as that given to Harland and Wolff in Belfast. Such action will undercut any other attempts within the city to promote industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of relying on ad hoc decisions or acting as the servant of the Treasury in cutting back expenditure in Scotland in a harmful way, the Secretary of State should take a fresh look at the ruin and devastation in the Scottish economy and tell his Cabinet colleagues where to get off. I hope that he will stand up for his country and for the area he is supposed to represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The debate is being held against the sombre background of the unemployment figures announced a week ago—at 305,800 they were a post war record and are due to go even higher. The July figures will be higher because the full effect of this summer's school leavers—apart from any other consideration —has not yet shown itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are worse for young people than for other sections of the community. They are worse for males than for females, because the unemployment rate is higher for males and, of course, they are not spread evenly throughout Scotland either by region or by industry. They are particularly bad in manufacturing industry and construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in a similar debate last year that there was a certain air of resignation about unemployment figures in the United Kingdom and in Scotland. But let me tell the Secretary of State that there is now increasing bitterness, anger and resentment about the continued failure of the Government to produce any effective solutions to the problems, and about the continuing worsening of the unemployment figures month after month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State gave us his usual bland speech at the opening of the debate. His picture of Scotland is completely unrecognisable, not only to me and to the Opposition, but to all those involved in industry in Scotland—whether trade unions, management or the population as a whole. Yet he appears this morning, as he has appeared on earlier occasions, as an unashamed apologist for Government policies which are bringing increasing ruin to manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
Last week, when these disastrous unemployment figures were published, I understand that the Secretary of State was unavailable for comment—as was his Under-Secretary. They are always available for comment on the few occasions when there is decent news to report. But last week they were unable to produce a crumb of comfort for the people of Scotland when the figures were announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our charge is that what has happened in Scotland is an inevitable consequence of Government policy. Faced with a problem—worldwide—the Government have invariably chosen solutions which have made the problem worse. The blessing of North Sea oil has of course brought jobs to Scotland—it would be a miracle if it had not done so. But for the national economy, because of Government economic policies, North Sea oil has proved so far more of a curse than a blessing. That is a remarkable achievement for any Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never believed those who at the beginning of the North Sea oil boom suggested that it would last only a few years. I always believed that it would go on for longer, but it is not a permanent support to the Scottish economy or the United Kingdom economy. On present policies, we shall eventually use up the North Sea oil and at the end of the day the economy and industry will be weaker than when the oil was first discovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be a tragedy but, because of present Government policies, it is an inevitable tragedy. Government economic policies, and in particular, monetarism, have proved complete failures; the economy is now so low, and industry so badly damaged, that it will take a long time to recover, and recovery will inevitably be slow—even with massive changes in economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The improvement in interest rates compared to those elsewhere has produced little relief to British industry, because it has been weakened and damaged with what has gone before. The same is true even of the weakening of sterling against the dollar, although that is misleading in terms of worldwide currencies as a whole. The view that used to be propagated by Conservative Members that from this would arise a leaner but fitter manufacturing industry is a myth and has been demonstrated to be a myth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be seen from other economies in other parts of the world that the most successful industries are those that have been based on long-term and sustained growth. Japanese and German industry are examples of that. There is not one example in any Western or similar economy in the world of an industry that has been so damaged as ours has by this Government then producing, phoenix-like, a great revival from the ashes and becoming successfully competitive. It has not happened anywhere else, and it will not happen in United Kingdom industry with the policies being followed by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Dr. Bray) that there is no point in pressing alternative economic policies on this Government, because they will not listen. He
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
made a number of constructive proposals which I welcome and support. I also welcome and support what has been done on matters such as the youth opportunities programme. However, with regard to special employment schemes as a whole, Scotland is doing relatively worse than the rest of the country at present. I would like an answer from the Under-Secretary on that point and I would also like changes of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is remarkable that, whereas in the United Kingdom as a whole 947,000 jobs are being supported by special employment measures at present, in Scotland the figure is only 56,000 which is less than our normal figure in terms of population, apart from the seriousness of our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although all our suggestions for improvement in that context—in training, re-training and so on—are worthy and useful and we want the Government to take them up, they will not succeed in solving our deep-rooted problems unless there is a massive change in Government economic policy. I shall outline that point since, otherwise, the Under-Secretary will say that we give no alternative policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should recognise first that any success that they have at present, even with inflation, has been strictly limited. Inflation is still higher than it was at the last general election. The taxes and prices index is considerably higher than it was at the last general election and, as far as we can see, it will go still higher. Even what has been achieved—limited success in inflation—is nothing to do with monetary policy but is all to do with the slump. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we want a removal of the obsession with reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement. These reductions are making the economy worse instead of better. They are deepening the recession rather than improving it. That applies to public expenditure cuts. When the Secretary of State wants local authorities and others to cut down the number in public sector employment, he might just tell the Committee that the simplest way of doing that is by stopping recruitment. The young people for whom crocodile tears are shed by Conservative Members are the first to suffer from reductions in public sector employment. The easiest way to reduce employment is to cut recruitment, which means that school leavers have an even worse chance of jobs than they have, miserably, at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the capital aspect, even the CBI now recognises the need for some stimulus in the economy with public expenditure. There was a tiny movement in that direction in the statement last week on railways electrification. But if our railways are to be improved—they certainly need to be improved and modernised— there is an unassailable case with regard to employment and any sensible economic strategy for large-scale expenditure on the railways when industry is in this period of slump.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of the construction industry. The worst record in housing since the war is the proud achievement of the present Government. Yet Scottish Office Ministers boast to us how they have cut the housing budget even further, on both the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
revenue and the capital side, when every cut in the housing budget simply means more construction workers on the dole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irony is that, far from public expenditure decreasing rapidly, we are now paying out in unemployment benefit what we would more sensibly be paying out to people to do productive and useful things for the benefit of the community as a whole. Of course, we need an encouragement to industry. The Budget was a non-starter from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), who talked about the incentives arising from tax concessions, failed to mention that in this year's Budget there were no increases in income tax allowances. There was therefore in real terms a disincentive of no less than £3 billion to personal taxpayers. That would have been bad enough, but the Budget also held out no hope for manufacturing industry, either through the national insurance surcharge or in any other way. Again we desperately need some encouragement to industry, to make it more profitable. Unless we can make it more profitable we shall not get manufacturing investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also in the future have to look to a more protectionist attitude towards imports than I should like. But there is no difference now between the trade unions and the CBI on this matter, because the CBI is leading the campaign to keep out Japanese cars and is seeking a protectionist stance on the MFA negotiations and the rest. Although I do not like to say this, I do not believe that our manufacturing industry will be able to survive unless it has a good deal more protection than it has at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more Government intervention in industry than we are seeing from the present Government. They do not have an industrial policy or, if they do, it is an absolute shambles. The Secretary of State this morning was boasting about all the money being put into BL and the BSC by the Government. The Government would allow private enterprise to fend for itself and would reduce the amount of help going to the nationalised industries. What is the reason for these great dollops of public money going into the BSC and BL? Basically, it is because in the present economic slump it is impossible to keep these industries going unless there is substantial Government assistance. But that is nothing like an industrial policy; it is not a coherent industrial strategy. There has been a whole list of failures in Scottish manufacturing industry, but the Government have made very little attempt to step in and protect jobs that ought to be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard the latest example of that in the Under-Secretary's appalling speech in the Adjournment debate last week, when the topic of the Burroughs redundancies was raised in the Chamber. There was an apology for the company, but no sign that in that case as in so many others—Linwood, Singer, Massey Ferguson and the rest—there had been any attempt by Ministers to fight to protect jobs in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need far more Government intervention in oil. We are delighted about the tension-leg plat
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
form being ordered by Conoco, and I hope that we shall have more information from the Under-Secretary about the full Scottish content of that order. But while that order is welcome, numerous orders have been lost over the last year to foreign competition. That is utterly scandalous, given the present situation in Scottish and British manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, within the last month or two, there has been the cancellation by Occidental of the floating production platform for the North Claymore field, which I hoped and expected would come to Scottish manufacturing industry. If in the defence statement last week there was good news for Yarrows—although I believe only temporarily good —what about the situation in Scott Lithgow? Scott Lithgow has a combination of yards in one of the worst economic and unemployment black spots in Scotland. Yet, as I understand it, the effect of last week's announcement—I shall be glad if the Under-Secretary can answer this point—and of what the Secretary of State for Defence said at his press conference is that Scott Lithgow will not even be considered in the future for the building of any diesel-powered submarines, and in any case the first of the new orders for these submarines will not come for several years. Therefore, in spite of our welcome for the immediate news about Yarrow, and our relief, let us not believe that it is good news as a whole for Scottish shipbuilding. Taken as a whole, what was said in the defence White Paper about shipbuilding is very bad news for the Scottish shipbuilding industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only sign that at the end of the day the Government may do something to reverse or modify the disastrous course upon which they have been set in the last couple of years is the speculation in the press that something will have to be done before the next general election. We are perfectly familiar with what Tory Governments do before the general elections. As has happend on previous occasions before general elections, for the most cynical reasons an electorate which has been damaged and bemused by previous Government policies is presented with a sugaring of the pill. But if all that we have is a temporary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be the most cynical betrayal of the Scottish people if we had not a change of policy before the next election but something that was done for simple electioneering purposes, because some of the damage done to Scottish industry is already irreversible. For thousands of young people in Scotland opportunity is lost for ever. Also many older unemployed people will finish what otherwise

He must know that industry is not and has not been competitive in world markets, and when one adds to uncompetitive industry a world recession on the present scale, we must inevitably suffer high unemployment, regrettable as it is.

The relative unemployment figure, which has been quoted many times in the House of Commons—but not in recent months, for obvious reasons—is now down at 119, which is a low figure.

The Labour Party could help, in Opposition, to improve job prospects in Scotland by helping to create understanding of the need for Scottish-made goods to be competitive in world markets. Many of our products are competitive, as my right hon. Friend said, but some key industries still lag behind. The Committee would make a grave error if it continued to disregard the speech, reported in today's press, made by the chairman of British Steel to the chamber of commerce in Glasgow yesterday. He pointed out that the performance of steel plants in Scotland was not up to the standard of other steel plants in the United Kingdom since he set targets for them in steel productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know no more of what is in Ian MacGregor's mind than what is reported in today's press. But when I say that the Opposition could help, I mean that Opposition Members can help to make sure that steel workers in Scotland, for example, are made fully aware of their responsibility for their own industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it bores hon. Members opposite to talk about relative productivity between Scotland and Britain or the rest of the world. There was an interesting article in yesterday's 	<i>Financial Times</i> referring to a Scottish-based multinational company, Coats Patons which since the 1930s, has made international comparisons of labour costs. The article points out that while wages in Germany are 33 per cent, higher than wages in the United Kingdom, productivity in the United Kingdom is only 65 per cent, of the German equivalent. I recommend that Opposition Members should look at the table on page 11 of yesterday's 	<i>Financial Tmies</i>—or at least those who seriously wish to understand the root cause of unemployment. If they are not interested in the facts, they will go on belly-aching, as they have done in the Committee and elsewhere. If hon. Members opposite are interested in the facts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way—they will then pay head to the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), who made these international comparisons. These are the unpalatable figures which Opposition Members are unwilling to accept and understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend rightly pointed out, there are great successes and achievements in Scottish industry—companies such as Babcocks, John Brown Engineering, Timex, Dawson International, are taking on the world and beating them—in price, in productivity and in quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other companies are repeating this success. In North Sea oil, there are almost 90,000 jobs in Scotland—jobs that have been created in the past 12 years—and 40,000 jobs have been created in electronics. We have the two major growth industries in the world expanding and doing well in Scotland.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
In the service sector, retailing, banking and insurance also continue to grow and to create new jobs. Therefore, the Scottish economy under the Government is not all gloom and doom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Craigton and for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) suggest— as we hear often nowdays—that what the economy needs is more investment in the public sector—in railways, telecommunications and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We maintain that it is in a revitalised private sector that economic growth, economic success and new jobs will be created and that that sector is the key to the solution of our economic difficulties. But I am sure that neither right hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the railways, telecommunications, the National Coal Board, British Steel or any other nationalised industry is not receiving a fair share of public expenditure. The amount of taxpayers' money going into these organisations in the past two years since the Government took office is unsurpassed in previous years. Thousands of millions of pounds of public money is going into public enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to those individual enterprises to put their own houses in order, to operate efficiently, effectively and to make sure that the funds allocated for investment—to the NCB, for example, —are used for investment and not to prop up uneconomic pits. That is the key, and the ball lies with the nationalised industries themselves. I hope that the right hon. Members for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles and for Craigton will emphasise those points to the nationalised industries when next they meet them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Scottish Office, we are concentrating on those areas which have been hardest hit by unemployment, as my right hon. Friend explained in detail. In west central Scotland, in Dundee, in Leith and the enterprise zone in Clydebank, we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
using the Scottish Development Agency with guidelines more appropriate to its duties and to its capabilities to help in those areas, we are also setting up the Location in Scotland Bureau which we are convinced will have an important and beneficial effect on inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have produced a number of proposals helpful to small business—as my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in Glasgow last month. We are co-operating and developing programmes with the new technological industries, microelectronics and biotechnology. A number of meetings have taken place on those subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absurd to suggest that my right ho(n. Friend does not speak for Scotland in the Cabinet. The most recent example of his force there was on the defence review. Despite the efforts made by the right hon. Member for Craigton to suggest that that review has produced deep problems in Scotland, the Rosyth dockyard has benefited from the sad losses now taking place at Chatham and Portsmouth. All the work on nuclear submarines will now be concentrated on Rosyth. I should have thought that at least the hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Douglas) or the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) would have had the good grace in the Committee this morning to acknowledge the role that my right hon. Friend has played in looking after Scotland's interests. The same is true of Ferranti, of shipbuilding orders, of Jetstream, and despite, the fact that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth for ever gets his facts wrong—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
