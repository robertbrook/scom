	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered Class XV, Votes 6, 8 and 9.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing is obviously an extremely important debate, although it may not always appear so to some Conservative hon. Members. About 80 per cent, of my constituency case load concerns public housing problems, such as transfer or repair, as well as problems in the private rented sector. Hon. Members who attend tenants' association meetings—I know that my hon. Friends do—and other meetings of community groups in our constituencies, particularly in housing schemes, know that housing is almost the sole topic of conversation. It arouses enormous passion among constituents, and people feel strongly about what the Government are doing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, housing is important because, among all the public expenditure programmes in Scotland, housing has been asked to bear the heaviest brunt. Expenditure on housing has been reduced by more than any other public expenditure programme. That means that it hits some of the poorest people hardest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it is difficult to see what the Government are trying to do on housing. What have they done so far? First, there was the sale of council houses. That was to be the major plank of the Government's housing policy. I do not think that they can claim—although I am sure that the Minister will make some attempt to do so—that it has been a great roaring success. In Glasgow, there are now 2,500 applications to purchase. That may appear to be a large number, but it represents only 1-3 per cent, of the total public housing stock in Glasgow. Therefore, there appears to be no policy, except to cut expenditure for the 98-7 per cent, of tenants left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second aspect of the Government's policy. To be fair, the Government introduced in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 which gave new rights to tenants in council houses. That was Labour Party policy, although the Minister tries to lay claim to the success of that policy. But what have the Government done? They have given rights to tenants to secure tenancies in houses which will deteriorate because local authorities cannot afford to keep them up. They have also given them the right to improve their properties. Most do not have the money to do so and cannot pay the costs out of their own pockets. Tenants can now apply to the local authority for an improvement grant, but they cannot get one because the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
local authority does not have any money to give give them, anyway. Therefore, the hopes that might have been raised by that aspect of the Government's policy have been foiled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and most damaging aspect, and the one that appears to be the only clear dominating feature of this Government's policy, is the choice of public sector housing as its major public expenditure target. The figures must be put on the record, so that we know exactly what the Government have done already and what they plan to do in the next three years. First, in 1979-80, the Government spent £765 million; in 1980-81, the figure was reduced to £687 million; in this year, 1981-82, it will be down to £614 million; by 1984, according to the White Paper on public expenditure, it will be down to £460 million. Over the total lifetime of this Government until 1984—it will not continue after 1984—that is a fairly massive reduction of some 40 per cent, in total housing expenditure. Before Conservative Member begin to complain " The last Labour Government did the same: they cut housing ", it is worth noting that over the same number of years—some people would have disagreed then with that Government's policy of cutting housing expenditure—the percentage cut was 11 per cent. Therefore, it is not fair to compare this Government's housing record with that of the last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the Government's housing plan at present, but presumably it is based on the understanding that they will get their economic policy right and that we shall eventually bottom out of the recession and start to climb back up again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the Government to answer my hon. Friend's question rather than me. I think that we are in a nosedive. It is a bit like the pilot saying that we shall reach the bottom eventually, but how many will survive the crash when it comes is open to question. This hope is based on the Government doing better than they have in the past. But, if their economic policies continue, if unemployment continues to rise, if the Government have to put more and more public expenditure into financing that rising unemployment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will probably come back to the Minister and say " I want more public expenditure cuts and more cuts in spending." As he has already selected housing as an easy target, housing will then presumably have to stand yet a further cut in Scottish Office spending. Therefore we could face an even more drastic situation than that outlined, which is drastic enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give some of the effects of the housing policy and those cuts. In 1980, fewer council houses were built in Scotland than at any other time since 1922, which was even before the famous Wheatley Housing Act of 1924, except, of course, during the war. The indications are that that figure is likely to continue to decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour's Green Paper, which the hon. Gentleman often prays in aid although he is pretty selective in his use of it, shows clearly what at that time my hon. Friends considered the need would be. The lowest estimate given for council housing up to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
1986 was some 30,000 new council houses. The highest estimate was 165,000. Even at the lowest estimate, we are far from achieving 30,000 by 1986 on the present building of council houses. That figure will take 15 to 20 years to achieve rather than the five to six years that it ought to take. Therefore the shortage of council houses is desperate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government's policy has meant considerably higher rents for council house tenants. Even higher rents are to be imposed on them by local authorities—certainly through no choice of Labour authorities which would prefer to keep the rents down. They are to be imposed on local authorities by the Government and, in turn, forced on tenants. This is happening at a time when many council house tenants are facing problems of unemployment and deprivation, to say nothing of the new social security legislation which is an incredible burden on them. The Government may say that rents are up to average earnings, but that does not take account of the low wages and unemployment problems in large council house schemes, particularly in areas such as Glasgow. If local authorities do not put up their rents to the level that the Minister considers necessary, he will cut their capital allocation and therefore they will be able to spend even less on the building of council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is no doubt that the present council house stock is deteriorating. The repairs and improvements that should be taking place in council house stock are not being carried out. As a result, houses built in the 1930s and even some of those built in the 1950s are in need of urgent repair. If local authorities are unable to carry out those repairs, some of those council houses will eventaully have to be demolished, and we shall lose housing stock as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems of dampness, which the Minister has recognised. Given that about 150,000 houses in Scotland require some form of action for dampness, that problem will not be tackled. I believe that £500 million is required to tackle the problem. It is unlikely to be carried out because local authorities will not have the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the massive cut in spending, there is a large increase in unemployment in the building industry. One in four of recognised building workers in Scotland—25 per cent.—are now unemployed. That is not in the public sector since, in many cases, private builders carry out the work. That is from a Government who came into power to help the private sector. All that they are doing is damaging the private sector, particularly in building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still 110,000 subtolerable houses in Scotland. Any hon. Member can see from the standards laid down in an appendix to the Green Paper what is meant by " subtolerable ". Unless there is a fairly massive programme to improve and bring up to standard that property, many of those houses will have to be demolished and will be lost to the housing stock in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present 157,000 people are on the waiting list in Scotland with little hope of getting a house. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
Minister will say glibly, as he has been saying for some time now, that that is not a realistic figure as many of these people are on transfer lists and therefore are not genuine applicants on the waiting list. However, many of them live in the 150,000 damp houses and have a very good reason for requesting to move out. Probably two people every two or three weeks come into my surgery with clothing which is green with mildew as a result of being hung in cupboards which are damp, complaining that they have young children with chronic chest complaints because they are living in damp houses. The whole family often has to live and sleep in one room since two rooms out of the three are not fit for habitation because of dampness. To say that the people in those houses who are seeking transfers to better housing are not genuine applicants on the housing list is, of course, nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had case after case of young people genuinely seeking accommodation who, having got married, are having to share houses with their parents and in-laws, with all the stresses that all of us understand can be created in that way. A large number of them are seeking houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That figure is perhaps not entirely genuine, but a large percentage of it consists of people who genuinely wish for better housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's answer to the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that the Government are not saying much. But they put up a case and call into aid the Green Paper. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) will catch your eye, Mr. Henderson, and he will be able to make a clearer statement of what is in that paper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Corrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bute and North Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman told his hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A man with my hon. Friend's experience in housing will almost certainly seek to intervene in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government call into aid the Green Paper to show that we now have a surplus of housing in Scotland. That is their argument, and they say that it solves the whole of our housing problem. There are supposed to be 150,000 houses vacant in Scotland, and, if there are 157,000 people on the waiting list, it is near enough for the Government to say that the problem is almost solved and that we can cut back further in housing than in other public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, of the 150,000 vacant houses in Scotland, 115,000 of them—76 per cent.—are privately owned. The remaining 35,000 are owned by local authorities, the SSHA, new towns and housing associations. Therefore only 24 per cent, of the supposed vacant housing is available to the 157,000 people on the waiting-list. Many of the empty houses in the local authority stock are empty for genuine reasons— they are being improved and are being left vacant for reletting. Some, in Glasgow at least, are vacant because the structures are being changed to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
a two or three apartment house into a five or six apartment house, to give accommodation to larger families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no surplus housing in Scotland—there is a genuine need for housing, especially for new, public sector housing. The so-called surplus takes no account of the special needs clearly identified in the Green Paper, such as special needs in particular geographical areas. Some parts of the country are still in desperate need, and those areas are often not those controlled by the Labour Party. One may be: Aberdeen, which faces enormous pressures because of the oil industry, has a greater need for rented accommodation and public sector housing. Badenoch and Strathspey council has suggested providing permanent caravan sites instead of building council houses; even before the cuts, Edinburgh recognised the need for 4,000 new council houses; and Skye and Lochalsh council recognises a need for better and more housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper does not take account, either, of any policy which takes more account than was done in the past of the needs of special groups. First, families of five or more account for 13 per cent., or 1 in 8 families, but only 4 per cent., or 1 in 25, public sector houses have five or more apartments. In 1978, 150,000 households were living in overcrowded conditions, as defined by the bedroom standard. That makes up 8 per cent, of the households in Scotland—double the rate in England. At one end, there is the problem of large families who have not been properly taken account of by the public sector in the past. At the bottom of the scale, there is a shortage of small houses for families of only one or two people. Fifty-two per cent, of Scottish households consist of one or two people, but only 14 per cent, of public sector houses have only one or two apartments. Therefore, there is a need for something to be done at that end of the scale as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheltered housing for the elderly is in short supply in Scotland. The Scottish Office estimated that 50 per 1,000 of the population required some form of sheltered housing, but on 19 March 1980 there was sheltered housing for only 19 per 1,000 of the population in the whole of Scotland. In some areas, the problem is even greater. There are no sheltered houses in Skye and Lochalsh, according to Scottish Office standards, and the Scottish Office estimates that sheltered accommodation is needed for about 22,000 extra people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 2,200 public sector dwellings for the disabled in Scotland and a similar number of houses have been adapted for that purpose, but there are 70,000 handicapped people whose needs should, by official standards, be met by special housing. Therefore, there is a great need for such housing to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the needs of the single person— particularly the single young person—who may be looking for some form of accommodation. All those examples show that there is still a large need for more public sector housing. Some local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
such as Glasgow are trying to carry out a policy of adapting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUI Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has read out an interesting list. Has he done any costing so that he can give the Committee the estimated cost of his programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was intending to come not to the question of costing but to the Government's second argument in the matter. I was identifying problems rather than laying down what should be done, although I believe that it should be done. I shall come to costings in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still a large need for public sector housing in Scotland. The Government cannot always make up their minds whether they are providing as good a service as the last Government as regards public expenditure, or whether they are carrying out their policies and cutting it. If the first argument is defeated, they say that they cannot afford it, any way. The public sector argument is that the State can no longer afford to pay for such housing and, therefore, it must be slashed. As housing is so important to so many people, one must ask why it should bear a heavier brunt of public expenditure cuts than any other area. As I have also sat for some weeks on the Finance Bill Committee and have seen the Government give way more and more money to their wealth friends—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: British Ley land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the Finance Bill. As they have increased the tax burden on the poorest at the same time, one begins to doubt the argument about the public not being able to afford to pay for better housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards benefits to housing from the State, whereas the Government have hammered the council tenant who has to pay more rent and receives a poorer service as a result, no attempt has been made to take away any element of the tax relief given to those with mortgages. Therefore, there is an unfair balance between those who live in and own their own houses and those who rent from local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know how high the cost of interest charges is in terms of income tax relief on public expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two billion pounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the figure is £2 billion, which is very high. The private sector is receiving benefits that the public sector no longer receives. The myth that the public sector housing tenant is subsidised by the State is no longer true, especially compared with the average mortgage holder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not touched on many housing issues, such as housing associations, which I hope that some of my hon. Friends will discuss, the problems of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
improving existing stock, the rapid decline in the number of private houses being built in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And new towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) mentions new towns, which are obviously of great concern to him. We should talk about the problems of involving tenants more in the decisions taken by local authorities. How council house tenants can play a greater part in the running of the affairs of their own estates is much more important to them than the sale of council houses. I should have liked to have covered that if time had permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Minister and the Government have no housing policy other than to cut blindly. The Minister is like a small child—a rather clever small child, I admit—who has been given an axe by his over-indulgent father, the Secretary of State, and his even more indulgent mother, the Prime Minister, to wield on the housing sector of Scotland. He is perhaps ignorant of the true conditions in which many people in my constituency and the constituencies of some of my hon. Friends live, and of the need to improve their housing, and, if so, he has no right to hold his office. If he knows the true condition, as I am sure that he does, he is showing a brutal callousness which is beyond belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.58 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks on my putative paternity, the true significance of which I shall no doubt absorb during the hours to come. I congratulate him on his maiden speech from the Opposition Front Bench. It appears that one has to be a Glasgow Labour Back Bencher facing parliamentary extinction to be called upon to serve on the Opposition Front Bench. Now that the hon. Member for Glasgow. Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) has indicated in the press that he intends to fight his Glaasgcw parliamentary colleagues to preserve his seat, we lock forward to the next debate, no doubt on overseas development, in the Scottish Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comments centred on three allegations. First, that the Government's housing policy did not have the support of the Scottish public. Secondly, that our policy on rents had put intolerable burdens on tenants. Thirdly, that we had refused to acknowledge the alleged existence of a Scottish housing crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, Mr. Maxton) referred to the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 and suggested that the Government's policy on the sale of council houses was somehow against the wishes of the Scottish public. I am not sure on what he based his evidence. After all, the Government's policy is to give every tenant the right to buy his own house. . It is interesting to see what the tenants themselves think about the new right. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
(Mr. Dewar) acknowledged that that was a major consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the MORI opinion poll, published in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> in May, council tenants were asked whether they thought that council tenants should have the legal right to buy their homes. Fourteen per cent, thought that they should not have that right, and 83 per cent, thought that they should have the right. Those were council house tenants themselves giving their views. When they were asked whether council houses should be sold at the full market price, or with discount, 6 per cent, believed that they should be sold at full market price, and 94 per cent, believed that they should be sold at discount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surprise, surprise!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another piece of information which will be of particular interest to Opposition Members. When those council tenants were asked to indicate their political allegiance, we discovered that no fewer than 75 per cent, of Labour voters who were council tenants believed in the right to buy council houses. We are entitled to ask ourselves who is out of touch with Scottish public opinion on this issue. Who does the Labour Party speak for when it says that there should be no right to buy? Clearly it is not for council tenants, 83 per cent, of whom believe in the right to buy. Nor does it speak for council tenants who vote Labour, 75 per cent of whom believe in the right to buy. Therefore, we are entitled to say that, apart from its being the voice of bureaucracy in the council offices, the Labour Party is utterly irrelevant in its policy on council house sales. It has won no support from the people of Scotland and has shown itself on this vital aspect of housing policy to be bankrupt in its attitudes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that this is a central platform for the Conservative Party in Scotland. If the policy is so popular, why did Conservatives do so badly in the last district council elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that council house tenants who wish to purchase their homes knew perfectly well that the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 would not depend upon the outcome of an individual local authority election. I accept the embarrassment of Opposition Members. They know that they do not have public opinion on their side. We have yet to see the first march of council tenants protesting against the right to buy their homes. We know that Labour voters among council house tenants are equally hostile to the Labour Party's policy on this issue. It will have to learn to live with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart suggests that our policies on council house rents imposed an intolerable burden upon the council house tenants of Scotland, and that they were suffering hardship. He also alleged that support given to owner-occupiers was greater than that given to council tenants. I am not sure where he got that information from, because I can give him the figures. The average relief given per owner-occupier in 1980-81 was £142. The average subsidy per tenant, including rent rebates,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
was £385. That is an important contrast which the hon. Gentleman will wish to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why, in Kilmarnock for instance, the fastest growing group on the housing list is that of owners who have had to give up their houses because they cannot pay their mortgages since they have become unemployed? They are now causing a real problem on the waiting lists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about fast-growing lists. I think that he will concede that the numbers involved are very small. There have always been owner-occupiers whose personal circumstances have changed and forced them to sell their homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Faster than ever before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a new phenomenon, as the hon. Gentleman knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Opposition Members consider whether rents in Scotland are excessively high, they should consider, for example, that the average household income in Scotland is now on a par with that south of the border, yet the average council house rent in Scotland is £7-70. The equivalent figure for England is £1135. Therefore, although incomes north and south of the border are comparable—the difference in average income has virtually disappeared— the difference in average rents—in England £11-35 and in Scotland £7-70—is a dramatic one which gives the lie to the suggestion that rents in Scotland are intolerably high. The fact that almost half Scotland's council tenants justify either a full remission on their rents or rent rebates puts the matter into its correct perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Craigen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have the equivalent figures for England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just given the equivalent. The figure of rent rebate entitlement and so forth is broadly comparable. It may differ by 1 or 2 per cent., but, broadly speaking, roughly 40 to 50 per cent, of council tenants in England are entitled to rent rebate and so forth. But the basic point is that the entitlement to rent rebate is based on income criteria which are common throughout the United Kingdom, and any tenant who needs that help gets it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing, therefore, with those tenants who, by definition, have incomes above a level that entitles them to rent rebate. Even after the last two years of Government policy, the average tenant in Scotland pays a rent of £7-70. A council tenant in England, with exactly the same income distribution pattern, pays an average rent of £11-35. No hon. Member will be able to persuade any reasonably-minded person that this suggests that there is an intolerable burden on council house tenants in Scotland as a consequence of the Government's rent policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To get this on the record, may I draw the Minister's attention to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
report issued yesterday by the SDA, which it had asked Arthur Young Consultant and Management Services to draw up? The report made it clear that workers in Dundee are paid one-third less than the average for the whole country. I hope that the Minister is not referring to Dundee in his last remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly concerned in this debate with the position of any one town. Clearly there will be differences in Scotland, as there are differences in England. We are talking about the average rent. An average rent means that some pay more and some pay less, which will plainly depend to some extent on local variations, as well as on national differences. But an average rent of about £4 less in Scotland than in England and Wales is not a factor that we can ignore as a statistical aberration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons for that low rent is that Labour-controlled authorities have refused to obey the Minister's instructions with regard to putting up rents. What would have been the level of rents if every local authority had actually carried out his instructions and put up the rents to the level suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have been considerably higher, as it would have been in England if English local authorities had also complied with the request of the Department of the Environment. So the argument, frankly, does not hold water. The real reason why rents are so low is that for many years Labour-controlled local authorities have artificially maintained rents at a ridiculously low level. That largely is why many housing problems remain in Scotland, particularly in the West of Scotland, which has been a Socialist monopoly at the local level for so many years. That is something which hon. Members know in their hearts to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the third main subject of the attempts of the hon. Member for Cathcart to condemn the Government's policy—his suggestion that there is today a housing crisis in Scotland. One is bound to ask when that crisis began and how it came about. I make no apology for continual reference to Labour's Green Paper. I know that the Opposition Front Bench now seek to distance themselves from the actions of that Government. The hon. Member for Cathcart said that some Labour Members might not have agreed with what the Labour Government did in respect of housing expenditure. In our last housing debate the hon. Member for Garscadden refused fully to endorse and support everything that his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), as the Minister responsible for housing, had done about totals of expenditure. I fully appreciate, therefore, that Labour Members today see the previous Labour Government as almost as much of an anathema as the present Conservative Government. Certainly as few are willing to support the Labour Government's actions at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am entitled to quote from the Labour Government's Green Paper. On page 1—right at the beginning, not as a conclusion—as one of the basic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
premises on which the whole document was based, it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the overall housing shortage is virtually a thing of the past in most areas and the worst problems of overcrowding and bad conditions have been dealt with. But some serious problems remain and new problems are emerging."</p></blockquote>
That was the attitude of the previous Labour Government, and it is the attitude of the present Conservative Administration. The hon. Member for Cathcart said that housing had borne the worst brunt of expenditure cuts, but he might also reflect that under his own Government housing was one of the few areas that had expenditure cuts. But, as expenditure was being increased in almost every other area, so housing expenditure in Scotland came down substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to page 34 of the Green Paper produced by the last Labour Government, where we see not only what happened under that Government but their plans for housing expenditure right up to 1980-81.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1970, investment by local authorities in Scotland was £312 million. In 1975-76, it had fallen to £228 million, and their plans were to ensure that by 1980-81 it fell further, from £228 million to £188 million. That is not the evidence of a housing crisis. Those figures do not suggest that the Labour Government were convinced that they faced an enormous crisis which required priority treatment and that the objective of a Labour Government would be the major expansion of housing expenditure that the hon. Member for Cathcart and his hon. Friends now suggest is a fundamental necessity of our housing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to read the total expenditure plans by the Government on housing in Scotland, as opposed to his sort of quote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If the hon. Gentleman looks at that total, he will see that grants and loans to private persons and to housing associations and other factors are included. The amount that housing associations are getting in Scotland is greater than they have ever had before. The amount that we gave to local authorities for their non-housing revenue account, to deal with improvements of older property, is up by 15 per cent, in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the total is going down. Ours was going up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot wriggle out of it. His main complaint against the Government has been about the capital allocations given to local authorities to deal with people on the council house waiting lists. Yet we find from his own previous Government's document that they had planned to reduce their spending constantly from 1975 up until 1981, and there was no suggestion that after 1981 the climb would not continue. That was the last Labour Government's policy. We are entitled to be extremely cynical and to treat with the utmost contempt any suggestion that somehow a housing crisis, which the Labour Government said was behind them in 1977 and which they did not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
claim had reappeared when they fought the election in 1979, has now suddenly become the basic part of housing policy in Scotland. It is a despicable approach which will not command the support of other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy for organisations such as Shelter and the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless which attacked the last Labour Government's housing expenditure policy as much as they attack the present Government's policy. Those organisations have maintained all along that housing expenditure should not be reduced. That is not a case that the Labour Party can make with any credibility. It is hypocritical in its suggestion that a crisis has emerged when it is now in opposition whereas before it was in government. That is not a policy which deserves the slightest respect from any fair-minded or objective person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the number of vacant houses in Scotland. The figure is slightly larger than he said. We now have the preliminary conclusions of the Census which was carried out recently. That suggests that there are some 190,000 dwellings in Scotland which had no household present at the time the Census was carried out. Of that total, some 100,000 can be classed as vacant houses. It does not matter so much whether those 100,000 vacant houses are in the public or in the private sector. I shall explain why. I am aware that a person on a waiting list cannot be allocated to a private sector house. But when we are considering how much of the nation's resources should be devoted towards new house building, it is the grossest height of irresponsibility to say that while there are many tens of thousands of empty houses and because they are not owned by the right persons, we must ignore them in considering the public expenditure requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the Labour Party would see the strength of that argument. We must look at what means can be taken to ensure that the housing stock is adapted to meet housing needs in Scotland. No one has doubted that at any time in the past. Therefore, that is a policy that should be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most interesting examples that we have seen in parts of Edinburgh, Glasgow and elsewhere is the extent to which local authorities are giving consideration to using those houses, which none of their tenants wish to live in, and to try to get them occupied by those who are prepared to live in them and to take over responsibility for them. We saw the exciting developments at Martello Court in Edinburgh, known as " Terror Tower", in which no tenant wanted to live and which was completely empty and boarded up but is now full of people who themselves were previous council tenants, living in the Pilton area. They are now living in those houses and, when interviewed on television, they said that they were delighted at what had come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Edinburgh district council will give some serious consideration to whether a similar scheme might be considered for the houses that are being considered for demolition in the Pilton
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
area. I do not know whether there would be a market for those houses in the same way as applied to Martello Court, but it is well worth pursuing as an option before a final decision is taken to demolish them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow, the same success has been achieved where this has been tried. In Easterhouse, some 54 houses in Glenelg Quadrant were sold within a few weeks to young married couples who wished to purchase them. An interesting article in a newspaper a few days ago described how those who had moved in—mostly young married couples who could not hope to buy houses elsewhere—had not only been able to purchase houses there, with the assistance of the district council, but also expressed their unqualified satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attractions to a young married couple are interesting. One couple who were interviewed said " If we had not bought this house in Easterhouse, we should have gone on the council house waiting list and almost certainly would have been offered a council tenancy in Easterhouse." If one compares their financial commitment with what they would have paid as tenants, it is clear that they are financially better off as well as having homes of their own. The net average repayment on the loans, after tax, for the tenants who have bought these houses, will be £374 per annum, and the standard rent is £419 per annum. Therefore, even from the financial point of view in terms of weekly outlay, it has been of considerable benefit to these people to purchase these houses rather than to take tenancies which they did not want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore think that we are entitled to ask the Opposition—and I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 54 houses in Glenelg Quadrant, to which he referred, which were considered to be waste property, were sold within two months for £3,000 each. Those who have taken the houses are delighted to have them. Once again the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> has aptly illustrated the Government's efforts to ensure that the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill is implemented correctly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend emphasised the point that I was making. I hope that when the hon. Member for Garscadden, who represents a Glasgow constituency, comes to speak in the debate, he will give the Opposition's view about these projects. Do the Opposition welcome the fact that houses, which tenants clearly do not want to live in, are being offered for sale to those who wish to buy them? Clearly there is a satisfactory response. Do the Opposition wish to encourage this, not only in Glasgow, but elsewhere in Scotland? So far, the hon. Gentleman has not given us his views or those of the Opposition on this important aspect of housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall issue, the Government expressed the view, as did the Labour Government's Green Paper, that what was needed in Scotland was a selective approach to deal with the remaining problems of Scottish housing. We have shown our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
acceptance of that view by increasing insignificant real terms—by 15 per cent.—the assistance given to local authorities to deal with improvement grants and help to poor quality housing in the private sector in their areas. We have given greater help than ever to the Housing Corporation to help housing associations—although I freely concede that it is a lot less than the housing associations would like; but it is more than they have ever had before, so that cannot be criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also expressed willingness to look at the housing plans of individual authorities in order to identify where the main areas of need still exist so that the capital allocations can be made on that basis to those local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have scrapped housing plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not scrapped housing plans, far from it. The hon. Gentleman will know that Glasgow district council will continue to provide a housing plan, and other local authorities, if new circumstances arise, can also immediately bring the matter to the notice of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concluding remark—because I want to allow the maximum time for hon. Members to take part in the debate—is that the hon. Member for Cathcart was asked by one of my hon. Friends whether he had costed what he now says that the Labour Party believes in—not what the Labour Government did or what it proposed to do in its Green Paper, but what they propose to do, which involves a massive increase in public expenditure on housing. It was clear from the hon. Gentleman's reply that they have not given a moment's thought to that exercise. It is in tune with the normal irresponsibility of the Labour Party that it puts forward grandiose schemes, the full cost of which is not appreciated until their implementation has begun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Garscadden, who is his party's official spokesman on Scottish housing, will make it plain to the Committee whether he repudiates the philosophy of the Labour Green Paper. Does he repudiate the view that the housing crisis is a thing of the past? Does he repudiate the proposal in the Labour Green Paper that expenditure on housing ought to have fallen between 1975 and 1981? If he were now the Minister responsible for housing, would it have been his policy to reduce expenditure on housing, as the Green Paper proposed—to reduce local authority capital expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! The hon. Gentleman must get it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand by my reference to local authority capital expenditure. So far, there has been a deafening silence on that matter. The hon. Member for Garscadden is obliged to inform the Committee whether to reduce expenditure would have been the policy of a Labour Government in office at the present time. If such a Government would have adopted that policy, everything that has been said in the past two years is cast into doubt. Not to do so, however, would have amounted to a repudiation of the views expressed by the right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan)— the then Secretary of State—and his hon. Friend the Member for Provan, when they jointly produced the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Garscadden was not necessarily responsible for the Green Paper. Perhaps he was not responsible for it at all. But that being so, we want to know whether he repudiates it or whether he agrees with its proposals and its objectives. If the hon. Gentleman fails to answer these points, his silence will be more eloquent than any comment he might have made. We wait eagerly for the end of the debate, when the Labour Party's policy will be made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.23 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wish that there was some system whereby ex-Ministers were given royalties on the number of references made to Green Papers. That would be some comfort to them on the Back Benches. I have paid tribute regularly to the Minister's debating skill, but it would be most unfortunate if this became merely a debate about the Green Paper which is now four years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say frankly that I regret the reductions in public expenditure on housing, but it must always be seen in the context of the wider economic policies pursued by the Government at the time. It was not a deliberate policy. Without going into details, however, I must give the qualification that there was a general recognition that the days of attempting or requiring to build 30,000 houses in the public sector had gone. Of course, there was some slack in terms of the need to redistribute the resources available in housing. However, there is nothing to be gained by pursuing that argument, either defending in full the activities of the Labour Government or trying to apologise for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that Labour did not spend more on housing. Members of the Committee can take advantage of that statement in any way they like. It is still a matter of regret that we are not spending more on housing, and more so under the present Government. The Minister suggests that we are out of touch with public opinion. I will hazard a guess that the Government Benches will not add to their strength at the next general election unless they have some help from the Boundary Commission. The Minister should not be so clever about the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone). I have great confidence in my hon. Friend's ability to survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful for the fact that so many Conservative Members have discovered that Glenelg Quadrant is in Easterhouse. I can assure them that the interest in this development is quite encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is depressing to have to debate housing in the context of the disastrous economic policies of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
Government. Even the right hon. Member for Sid-cup (Mr. Heath), who is in the headlines, makes the point. I think he may carry more weight in the Conservative Party than I do, so there is no point in me wasting my time on it. Perhaps I should have said that he has as much influence in the Conservative Party as I seem to have now in the Labour Party. I regret that one or two of what I regarded as quite important things that were done have been changed by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to this new publication by the Barratt organisation, 	<i>Arena,</i> which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Last year was a black spot in Britain's housing history with only 97,000 private homes being started—the worst record since the 1920s</p></blockquote>
That fact is also emphasised by the Scottish figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>Arena</i> is an attempt to provide a forum for discussing the housing problems in Scotland. It is a matter of regret that for a few thousand pounds the Government should have abolished the home ownership forum, which was a genuine attempt to provide an opportunity for all interests, public and private, to discuss with freedom some of the controversial and sensitive matters of land availability. We must have no doubt that the insinuations about graft and corruption in local government are related to the pressure that can be put on local councillors to make land available for private building. Therefore this was a genuine attempt on our part to provide a forum in which these matters could be discussed openly. This is a petty, niggling thing that the Government have done in an effort to pacify or satisfy the ideological absurdities of some of the more reactionary hon. Members. I think that these are matters of regret, although I agree that they are not tremendously important in regard to resources in the whole housing scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was arguing about the great benefits of the sale of council houses. It is a long time since I heard the Scottish Farmers Union complain about a Conservative Government and housing. Indeed, it found it necessary to draw attention in the June issue of the 	<i>Farming Leader</i> to its anxiety that houses might not be available for displaced, sacked or retired farm workers in some areas as they used to be. I hope that the Minister will take on board the fact that, as we warned him, the wholesale selling of council houses can cause a genuine problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even some of the Minister's friends have a personal regard for the appointment to the Housing Corporation of Gordon Muir, who commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While it is the largest amount so far made available to housing associations in Scotland, it will however not allow associations to mount the programme they had hoped."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will accept that we shall not make much headway in looking at the real housing problems if we only make debating points. I assure him that we can make more than he can: we have more material with which to do it. It is an indication that the housing association movement is sagging badly. Indeed, there is a substantion loss of morale, in spite of the gloss put on it by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was genuinely trying to make a brief comment. and I come to the main substance of my remarks, namely, the fourth housing plan from Glasgow. It is a draft proposal under discussion at present and is a workmanlike and realistic document. I shall not comment on the fact that the Minister is again trying a bit of shadow boxing in saying that the housing plans have not been abolished. Again it is a bit of cheese-paring that seems unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing plan was to do two things. It was to force local authorities to take a wider look at their housing responsibilities and was aimed at having an annual discussion at all levels on a subject
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
that is obviously important. For the sake of saving a few staff in St. Andrew's House—that is the only reason there can be—the Minister has destroyed something that I considered to be of value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow plan—the fourth plan—is a reasonable document, though it makes depressing reading. Chapter 1 reveals that because of existing commitments there will be only £8 million—for a city the size of Glasgow—to spend on new projects this year. I have not the time and it is not my job to defend in detail everything that Glasgow has done. I am sure that the point that it overspends will be raised by some Conservative Members. However, I want to draw the Minister's attention to some of the implications of the capital allowance given to Glasgow this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have complimented my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) on his opening speech, but I hope that he does not think that I am getting at him as an academic when I say that one great benefit of the Glasgow housing management department is that it now has a good management team. They can write better reports and express them in language that I am sure will be understood in St. Andrew's House. I see that the heavy mob are all here—the experts to advise the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I see reports that have been prepared by such people—the Glasgow team has done a good job, as I said—the way in which they bring in new language always strikes me as marvellous. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The preparation of a housing plan has had to come to rely on a large element of crisis management, rather than on effective forward planning."</p></blockquote>
I do not know where they dig up some of these phrases. T would like somebody to explain what crisis management is about, because it seems to have no relevance apart from just putting in a few words. However, that would be an unfair and churlish comment about a good report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is challenging my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, but I hope that he will give Glasgow some encouragement in its efforts to reduce the population decline. At least it is slowing down and, I might add, that will help the boundary changes, and should be encouraged. The vacancy rate of public sector houses in Glasgow is significantly lower than for many years. I know that we have to take into account that houses have been pulled down, but Glasgow deserves some favourable comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to poor housing areas however, it is sad to think that there are still about 16,000 houses that are more than 60 years old and, that many tenements in Glasgow housing action areas still require improvements. I am not criticising Glasgow, but trying to emphasise that there are still more than 7,000 houses that are not even included in any programme. As long as that situation exists in any part of Scotland, there is no room for complacency. We certainly should not allow housing to become a matter of debate rather than a genuine concern for those still living in intolerable conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
There is also the problem of the number of houses that still have lead piping. I think that this matter can be exaggerated. It is almost like those who argue that a puff of someone else's smoke on a bus will cause a man to die 10 years earlier than expected. Nevertheless, lead pipes are a health hazard and even in Glasgow's estimate, it will be 30 years before the problem has been tackled. That gives some idea of the time involved and the commitments placed on an authority with so many outstanding problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Glasgow has a special problem in the refurbishing of empty houses. I wish that more community workers and even those in the Labour Party would stop trying to justify or excuse or understand why people become vandals. The vandalising of empty houses appals me. I do not think that anyone has the solution and that is not because of prejudice or bias, but I hope that the Minister and, indeed, Labour Members take into account that there are massive problems in Glasgow because of areas of deprivation. It has the highest number of single parent families, although not all those children are vandals. The greatest areas of deprivation are still to be found in some of the post-war housing schemes that my hon. Friends the Members for Cathcart and Garscadden and I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that Glasgow is having to spend about £5 million out of its revenue budget on the refurbishment of empty houses. That is a shocking indictment of society. I do not claim that all that is caused by the Government's general economic policies, but we cannot divorce the problem of housing from the economic circumstances or the policies of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to see an expansion of housing and more houses built for sale. Perhaps I could have a reply to the question I raised during the debate in May but which received no reply. Do the Government intend to force local authorities to sell houses by making an allowance in their capital allocations on the assumption that they have sold council houses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my question is clear. Can the Minister tell us what negotiations are taking place at the moment? Is he likely to try next year, perhaps, to include, as part of the capital allocation, an assumption that authorities will have sold so many council houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifldnd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The capital allocations this year will include such an assumption because the local authorties were unwilling to have the system changed so that each authority could benefit from whatever sales it made. We hope that a local authority will be able to add to the capital allocation given by the Department any revenue received from the sale of council houses or from other assets belonging to that authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not answer the question. I do not disagree with that general approach, but can the Minister say, specifically, whether the Government intend to assume that there will be council house sales and to include that assumption in their capital allocation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, is it not. I think that I am right to believe that my next question is related to the same point. Is there any difficulty in allowing Scottish authorities to acquire property, improve and sell it? It seems that would be a useful weapon particularly for the authorities in Glasgow. The Minister challenged my hon. Friend the Member for Gascadden to reply on homesteading. I do not care what our party policy is; I think that home-steading would be a good idea. I cannot see any reason why there should be any difficulty. I hope that I have shown a way to solve some of the outstanding housing problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great privilege to follow the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) in a housing debate. He has undoubtedly become the guru of Scottish Members on this subject. Indeed, after the Committee adjourns, I intend to ask him to autograph my copy of the consultative document of 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) typified the Opposition's attitude to housing. They approach the subject exclusively as a matter of statistics and not as one of people's needs. The hon. Gentleman's speech was redolent with facts and figures, but there was no mention of people and their need for homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote just one figure. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the surplus of dwellings, which totals 192,000. When I raised this matter in the debate in May, the retort of the hon. Member for Provan was that that was " sheer statistical information." I am not sure what is meant by " sheer " statistical information—perhaps it is the opposite of " mere " statistical information. However, the hon. Gentleman did not dispute the basic truth of that statistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That figure could be broken down in various ways. Perhaps some of the houses are in the wrong place. That must be so, considering the figures revealed by the recent census that show a substantial movement of the Scottish population. One could point out, as the hon. Member for Cathcart did, that only about 35,000 of those dwellings are in the public sector. But that is a lot of houses. The hon. Gentleman implied that people on the waiting lists could not contemplate going into private housing. But why should those on the waiting lists consider themselves to be limited exclusively to those 35,000 houses when there are more than 150,000 others also standing empty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quoting interesting statistics. I have another one for him to swallow. There are about 110,000 sub-tolerable houses in Scotland. What will his party and Government do about improving them or demolishing and replacing them with better houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the question of improvement grants in a moment. It is a very important area of housing policy, and it was given particular emphasis by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Campbell of Croy during his tenure of office. He anticipated the drive in this direction, echoed by the hon. Member for Provan and his colleagues in their Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point about empty houses and the large number of them in the private sector, is that that reflects the inadequacy of protection for private landlords which existed before the passage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. It is to be hoped that the realistic introduction of short tenancies in that Act will increase the occupation of such houses and ease the housing problem generally. It may be suggested that those houses are often in poor condition. Again, the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act has a realistic and relevant approach to the problem in that it increases the opportunities for private ownership, which undoubtedly leads to a better standard of housing than local authority ownership—I have not heard Opposition Members suggest otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for a shift of emphasis in our approach to housing away from the sheer stressing of crude building statistics. Improvement is important, and there is a particular need to concentrate on such problems as dampness, to improve insulation in houses, and to improve the quality of design and to relate it more closely to the needs of those seeking housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan's Green Paper on housing underlines that effectively. On page 3 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The state of Scottish housing today is a tribute to past achievement. The absolute shortage of housing which has dominated housing policy in the past has been eliminated in most cases and housing conditions are vastly improved. A higher proportion of Scottish households than in the rest of Europe now have the use of basic amenities",</p></blockquote>
although it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But housing problems remain".</p></blockquote>
That point is echoed by Shelter in its document entitled "Dead End Street" which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland's housing is more modern, and better provided with the basic amenities, than that in the rest of Britain. But past achievements should not blind us to the considerable problems remaining."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to embarrass the hon. Member for Provan, in his absence, by quoting further glowing comments from the Green Paper. I think that the point is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must concentrate on the type of housing and the needs of those seeking it. We should reflect on some of the homes built in Scotland which are monuments to the " out of touchness " of those who erected them. One needs only to see the high-rise flats in many of our cities to realise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Martin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned high-rise flats. Surely he recognises that the majority of such flats and in high demand, and are therefore not undesirable dwellings, as he suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The occupants of high-rise flats to whom I have spoken find them extremely unattractive. Such flats are often isolated, but happily there are very few in my constituency—indeed, I should be pushed to find any. But when I have canvassed in Glasgow constituencies—I recall, for example, the election to Parliament of Professor Esmond Wright, when we won Glasgow Pollok—I have encountered people in acute misery and often in a state of nervous distress because they live in high-rise flats. One reflects on the words of the song " Stranger in Paradise "—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Somewhere in space I hang suspended ".</p></blockquote>
But sadly those tenants are not in paradise. They are strangers to each other, because they do not know their neighbours. They have no gardens or amenities. They are terrified by vandalism. The lifts do not work and the stairs are filthy. Strangers they are to each other, but they are not in paradise —purgatory would be a more appropriate description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Government's policy reflects the need for a more flexible approach to housing in Scotland. One special need is for more smaller houses. Reference has been made to the need for sheltered housing—a highly desirable object of public housing policy—but we also want smaller houses with fewer apartments for young couples and for what one might call " mature " couples with families who have grown up, married and left home. That is in addition to the need for special housing for the elderly and the disabled. A greater adaptability in the cellular structure of housing, allowing adjacent houses of varying numbers of apartments to be adjusted as needs change would be a creative and constructive approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With our more sensible and realistic policies, we have not had to contend with the mortgage famine we endured for years under the previous Government. Mortgages are readily available from building societies, and have become increasingly available through banks. Under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act local authorities are obliged to provide a mortgage if necessary. Improved mobility has been created by the Act, and that is an important factor in the new mobile Scotland that the census has just revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart said that about 80 per cent, of his constituency mail is concerned with housing. I am not surprised, because his constituency contains that great monument to local authority housing incompetence—the Castlemilk housing estate—an indictment of Labour Party local authority housing policy over the generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members accuse us of being divisive in our housing policies. But our policy of enabling tenants to buy their houses means that great solid slabs of council houses can be broken up and more varied housing introduced into such areas. The Labour Party has still not answered this question: does it want Scottish tenants to have the right to buy their houses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave some telling figures from an opinion poll, but the Opposition are ambivalent on the question. They are terrified to come clean and admit that they do not want tenants to have the right to buy their own homes because they like to direct people in every sphere not only housing. They like to control people, bully them and tell them that the Labour Party knows what is best for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart dismissed our policy on tenants rights by saying that the Opposition intended to do the same. Presumably they wanted to allow tenants to decorate and improve their houses; to have written leases; to be allowed to sublet and take in lodgers. If that is so, why did they not do it in five years in office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives would have given such a Bill an unopposed Second Reading, the Committee stage would have lasted for two sittings—if not one— and the Bill would have passed into law. As soon as we came into office we introduced just those provisions in a major piece of legislation—the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, and the local authority tenants in Scotland are the better for it. The Labour Party is not concerned about people and their homes —only with statistical abstractions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which Conservative-controlled district councils, as opposed to Labour-controlled councils, have given clear commitments for the development of co-operative tenancies for local authority housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are now getting the underlying nature of the economy right, and that is reflected in the control we have been able to exert by burning out Socialist inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet turned the tide of unemployment, because of the supreme momentum with which it was running when we came into office. Opposition Members have not mentioned the cost of implementing all the policies that they want. Only if we get the underlying economy right can we achieve fulfilment in our housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since we have come in to power the Government have produced a realistic and balanced programme. The Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act was a major step forward in Scottish housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government obviously need to do more not only for tenants, but for those concerned with the building of houses. Although the Opposition tend to come down in favour
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
of council house tenants and those on the waiting list, or the transfer list, we are also concerned about the building industry. The construction industry is the first to suffer in any economic recession through the postponement of capital projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee 1,664 building trade workers are unemployed. The Minister gave me that figure in a written reply on 18 June and said that it represented 24 per cent, of the construction industry's labour force in Dundee. Government figures show that it costs about £6,000 a year to keep one unemployed person. On that basis alone, the Government are spending £10 million to keep more than 1,600 construction workers in Dundee on the dole. That is not only a shocking waste of public expenditure but it is more than the value of the housing support grant given to Dundee district council and more than the amount the council would have received if it had given into the Government and had raised rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Continually over the past year my right hon. and hon. Friends have attacked the Government's policy on the amount given to district councils for building renovation and modernisation. The Government's policy is politically motivated: "Raise your rents or have your capital allocation slashed." No consideration has been given to the needs or the merits of the community with regard to housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The needs of Dundee's housing policy have been cruelly ignored by the Government. More than 6,000 houses in the privately rented sector are sub-tolerable and require modernisation. More than 4,000 houses built between the wars require urgent modernisation. The SSHA's building programme in Dundee has been axed dramatically by between £8 million and £10 million. That programme would have been work for the construction industry. The cut has been made despite the fact that there has been a massive increase in SSHA rents in Dundee. Large gap sites througout the city have been created by the Government as a result of the cuts in SSHA programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has completed only 100 houses in the past year. It is not only Labour Members who are complaining. Recently in Dundee, Mr. Bill Brown, the president of the Building Trades (Employers) Association issued a statement on the findings of a survey carried out in the local private construction industry:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The total value of substantial capital projects which have been abandoned or deferred in past months amounts to at least £33 million."</p></blockquote>
The findings show that the private sector accounts for £3-5 million and the public sector £24-5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown went on to suggest:
	<br><blockquote><p>" It is possible that the true total figure could be up to £40 million or £50 million."</p></blockquote>
It was the "unanimous view" of all those who attended the meeting that the crisis affecting the building industry was likely to accelerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would benefit more if, for example, the Dundee district council were allowed to proceed with its projects to help the construction industry. Similarly, if the SSHA were allowed to proceed with some of its capital projects—the Cupar Street site, for example, on which the council wants to build houses but which has gone to a private contractor, tenants would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report went on to say that the cutback would affect training and that it would be difficult to attract skilled workers back into the industry. It went on to make points which are very relevant to Government Members. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most of us believed at first that the Government's policies were good and that an improvement would eventually come. But now we are disillusioned",</p></blockquote>
Now the private sector contractors are disillusioned with the Government. The report continues
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was also criticism of Scottish Secretary Mr. George Younger from Mr. Brown"</p></blockquote>
at the same meeting. Mr Brown said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After meeting union representatives last year, we jointly contacted Mr. Younger requesting a meeting to discuss the serious situation. We felt things were different and a little worse in Dundee than in other places. But he refused to meet us."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman refused, and the Government also refuses to listen to pleas from the construction industry in Scotland.

ployers he must address himself to that report and the comments therein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district council's capital allocation has been cut by about 50 per cent, which means that only a handful of houses will be built this year. I accept that Conservative Members would claim that comments by me or the district council are politically inspired, so I shall quote two examples from the execellent report " Dead End Street" produced by Shelter, which I hope that everyone will accept as an impartial source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter estimates that at the present rate of modernisation of the housing stock, which is being run into the ground because of the Government's housing policy, it would be the year 2000 before all the inter-war houses in the city were modernised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may refer to a part of my constituency, there are 300 houses in West Kirkton with structural defects and dampness making them a serious fire risk. Unfortunately there have already been many fires in such houses, some of which have resulted in tragic loss of life. The fire officer of Tayside fire brigade has expressed anxiety over the state of those houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Modernising those houses will cost around £4 million nad there is certainly no money in the district council kitty or from the Government that would allow that modernisation to go ahead. It will be at least five years before we can even consider modernising these houses—five years in which tenants will have to live in those houses with the fear of fire and possible loss of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the Government's policy as it applies to both council house tenants and owner-occupiers. It involved a steep rise in mortgage interest rates in January 1980, which added 25 per cent, to owner-occupiers' costs at a stroke. As a result of the Government's policies, council house building is at a record low for the years since the war. In Dundee, only 80 council houses were built last year. The SSHA programme has been halved,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
and no housing association projects have been allowed to start this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 13,500 people on the waiting and transfer list in Dundee, and that figure is steadily rising, at a time when we have been forced to consider selling houses. Such sales will further reduce the opportunities of those people to transfer out of those houses and into more suitable accommodation.

Tenants have been forced into the private sector where they have to pay exorbitant rents or live in slums, but, at the same time, the Government have cut their income and weakened their security of tenure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The special needs programme had to be cut back. For example, there is an increasing demand for sheltered housing for old people. Meanwhile, Dundee has less than a quarter of the sheltered housing that it urgently needs, and the list of medical priority applications continues to spiral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee needs £22 million a year in capital investment in public sector housing. The Government intend to cut its spending to £5 million. It is time that the Government realised that they have a duty towards the needs of Scottish tenants. The majority of Scottish people five in the public sector, and that sector should therefore have the highest priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot say that the Government do not know how to solve the problem. Conservative Members have asked how we would fund a programme. First, we would cancel die Trident. That would give us at least £6,000 million. We would get rid of the cruise missiles—we do not need them either. We would use some of the money to benefit the construction industry and the housebuilding programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would also look at some of the other nonsense in this country. There is a laser at Alder-maston, for instance, that is used to simulate a holocaust. Every time it is fired, and it is fired quite regularly, it uses the equivalent of the total generating capacity of the United Kingdom. At the same time as we are wasting money on simulating a holocaust which none of us wants and which we all hope will never occur, electricity generating boards throughout the country are cutting off supplies to old folk's and poor people's houses because they cannot pay their electricity bills. That is an example of the sense of priorities we are discussing when we discuss public sector housing and housing generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That demonstrates the economic madness of the monetary policy of the Government. I contend that the Government will do little for housing in Scotland. There is nothing contained in the Estimate that we are debating which will benefit the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), but my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State should not be too worried about not being allowed to intervene, because the hon. Member for Dundee, West failed to answer the points put to him by either of my other hon. Friends. He failed to answer the point put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), thus proving, I assume, that the events on which he was castigating this Government came to light during the lifetime of the previous Government. If he wants to castigate someone, it must be a joint castigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also ignored the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart). We may assume, therefore, that he is doing the decent thing on his £13,900 and moving from the public sector into the private sector, thus allowing somebody on the waiting list to get a house in the public sector. We congratulate him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not making an attack. I was merely making an observation. In fact, I was congratulating the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) on his move, I shall come to the question of mortgages shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that scorn is poured on the use of the statistics that there is a raw surplus of houses in Scotland, but it is true. If the statistics were the other way round, Labour Members and organisations such as Shelter would call it to their aid. I think that we should bear that statistic in mind, although we should not necessarily found absolutely everything upon it. However, it is not only contained in the Green Paper, and perhaps this will bring encouragement to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1981 structure plan for Strathclyde paragraph 1.52 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The housing demand forecasts indicate the emergence of a crude housing surplus in many districts even at the higher forecast level. This forecast does not allow for the prospect that more relaxed house letting arrangements will generate additional households. Furthermore, the forecasts "—</p></blockquote>
in other words, of a crude housing surplus—
	<br><blockquote><p>"do not reflect the deficiencies in the existing stock in terms of special needs such as sheltered housing."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that we should debate housing in party-political terms because although changes have been made between the previous Government and this Government they have not been great changes of strategy. The problems in Scotland have not occured since May 1979 but are of long standing. I want to discuss one or two of them and to ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to tell us about some of the more difficult and intractable problems in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced, from personal knowledge, observation and the welter of statistics, that it must be clear to everybody that apart from specific areas,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
we do not need general housing programmes of three or four apartment houses. The real problem is in smaller houses. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that about half the households in Scotland were one or two-person families. That probably applies to both ends of the age spectrum—to the young and to the elderly. One of the encouraging trends is that in both the private and public sectors the number of one or two apartment houses that have been built has shown an encouraging increase. That tendency and balance will have to continue for a variety of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can put more elderly people into more suitable accommodation—either smaller houses or sheltered accommodation—that will relieve the three and four apartments that they are at present occupying, in some cases most unwillingly, for use by people who need such housing. Many old people live in houses that are too big for them, on the periphery of our towns and cities or on hills. Those houses are suitable for young people, but are not at all suitable for the elderly or the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary —this is why a debate on housing would be best conducted in a less party-political atmosphere—to continue the priority that he has given and that the previous Government gave to moving our housing expenditure in a different direction from the post-war years and towards sheltered housing accommodation and smaller units where elderly and young people can live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will continue that development. I shall give him every encouragement to fight for money for that sector since it would not only solve the problems of those people but help people looking for three and four apartments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the spectrum are the young. My hon. Friend mentioned the MORI poll, which showed that many young people would prefer not to live in council houses but to have different forms of owner-occupation. Indeed most people recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde document to which I referred suggests that there will be a shift in the favour of owner-occupation of 0-4 per cent, per annum in the Strathclyde region in the future. I do not know how one computes a shift of 0-4 per cent., but that shift will occur and we must take it into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would answer the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) on mortgages. I cannot understand why we have gone into trench warfare about mortgage relief, because it is an important part of the housing scene, as is the Government's help to local authorities and the support given to housing by the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote the facts, which are often distorted. The figure that I have from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for 1981-82 per public sector dwelling on Exchequer subsidy and rate fund is £300. The figure given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor for mortgage tax relief in Scotland is £355, but—an important " but" has to be put in—that is per current mortgagor. One has to remember that there are people who no longer have a mortgage and therefore, they are now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
out of the figures. The more relevant figure might be the £130 per owner-occupied dwelling, which takes in those who currently have mortgages and those who no longer have mortgages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point. Would he not agree that the simplistic figures given by the Under-Secretary in his opening remarks, which gave a totally different impression from that which the hon. Gentleman is now giving, suggest at least that the Minister if not being dishonest, was oversimplifying for party political purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary never simplifies figures other than to help the Opposition with ease of digestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will appreciate that just as the figures that I gave applied the mortgage subsidy for all owner-occupiers, irrespective of whether they receive one, the figure that I gave for rent rebates and subsidies also applied to a base involving every single council tenant, although more than half do not receive any rebates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. It is important when we look at mortgages to remember that there are two different figures and to remember all those helped in home ownership by mortgages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked why there is trench warfare about mortgage interest relief and local authority rent subsidy. The answer is quite simply that Conservatives always attack local authorities tenants as though they are the only people who have been helped in the housing market, when it is clear that other people are helped as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is the case. The hon. Gentleman may wish that it were in order to further his own argument, but I am not using it today, as I am sure he will be the first to admit. I did not want to be diverted on that point, but it has been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go on to the general question of the different ways in which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the Government and local authorities can help young people to gain their objective to own their own homes. There is a variety of ways. Councils can be helpful with their structure plans. I am happy to say that Strathclyde regional council recognises the increasing demand in the private sector and is attempting to find ways to ensure that inside its structure plan the future demand will be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning authorities must give speedy decisions on their planning applications, because in inflationary times—we have had them for 10 years, so I am not making a party political point about one year as against another—it can make an immense difference to a couple's calculations if they have to wait a considerable time for a planning application. My hon. Friend and the trunk roads authorities in the rural areas must be a little less rigid about access on to the trunk roads, because that can be an inhibiting factor in development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A variety of interesting schemes has been under	<div class='sup'>*</div> <!-- sup --> taken in England and Wales to encourage young
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
people to buy; starter homes. I hope that we in Scotland will move along that road as well. I know that the Argyll and Bute district council has tried the joint approach with some success. A builder built houses on a plot owned by the council, which sold them to people in council houses and on the waiting-list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will say something about the problems that Barratt's development schemes are facing in Scotland. Those small houses satisfy considerable demand in England and Wales and I think that it would be unfortunate if they were kept out of Scotland because of our regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned Martello towers and I think that the television programme about that on STV was most interesting. It showed clearly that people generally want to own their own homes and that council tenants also want to own their own homes. I think that the homesteading project, which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) mentioned, and the article about that in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> is most interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine from that article that, although the Glasgow council might be a little embarrassed about finding that people are prepared to buy houses in such an area, it will not take a dogmatic view and will continue to sell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on for too long, but I should like to mention two other problems. First, dampness has been with us for a long time and can affect houses that are no more than 10 or 12 years old. That is worrying and it has occurred even in houses that were built to higher standards such as the Parker-Morris standards and so on. The problem might be easier to solve if it affected every house in a scheme rather than only some. Many officials simply do not know the solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard much about the problem, but little about the solution. I hope that my hon. Friend can say something about the solution. I would be right behind him in getting money to help with the solution, but I am not in favour of throwing money at the problem if we do not have a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to remind my hon. Friend about the short debate we had in a Statutory Instruments Committee about housing associations and housing action areas. I raised the question, as did other hon. Members, of the problem of shop accommodation in tenemented property being modernised by housing associations or by those occupying the shops and flats. People in the shops are faced with large bills for modernisation, whereas those in the houses get grants. It would be helpful if my hon. Friend could say something about the discussions taking place to try to solve the problem so that shopkeepers are neither driven out, nor hold up the housing action area development, which is something we want to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to examine the housing picture against the background of the raw statistics and from the point of view of particular problems. I encourage my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to do as much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
as possible to attack three particular problems: smaller houses, dampness and rehabilitation of tenement property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least we can say one thing about the Conservative Party: it is consistent. It is consistently bad, day in and day out. Last week the Minister was weeping crocodile tears for the ratepayers, yet the Government increased the rates by cutting the rate support grant. This week he is lecturing us about housing. We know that he simply reflects his party's two-nation philosophy, which can be seen clearly in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, for example, that while the Government speak about inflation, they fuel it by various means including an increase in rents. The Government are calling for a further increase of 40 per cent. That is incredible. It is an attack on living standards and will not help to solve our economic problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rent increases are judged against the Government's 7 per cent, wages policy, we know what those rent increases will mean for hard-pressed families. It would be all right if the average wage earner received 7 per cent, of the Minister's salary and he got the 7 per cent, of the average worker's pay. That would be fair. But the Minister would not accept that because his party does not accept fairness. It does not accept the basic fairness of trying to improve the conditions of working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the rent increases will go towards the burden of interest rates. Essentially, this a bankers' Government. We are subsidising big business. The Government believe in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more houses in Scotland. Older houses need improvements. The Government say that that is not necessary and so they make a 34 per cent, cut in the housing support grant. That is one of the major demands that the Government are making on local authorities and it is ironic and tragic when so many people are looking for a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is estimated that 157,000 families are on the public sector waiting lists in Scotland. In Edinburgh 12,000 families are looking for a house. Yet the prospects of their getting one in the near future are very slim. The Government may claim that that is not a problem. We have heard various arguments about under-occupation, under-use and so on. If that is the case the Government should sell the official residence in Edinburgh which the Secretary of State uses occasionally. Why is that house not sold—to set an example—if they believe in their sales policy? Again we see double standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
nation? Every component part within that house was given by people who had a great desire that the Scots should have a place which the Secretary of State for Scotland, regardless of his political colour, could use as his official residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am glad to know that the Secretary of State for Scotland has squatters rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must point out to the Government that they have no mandate to attack jobs and to inflict misery on working people. Many thousands of building workers are unemployed unnecessarily when they could be building houses. Many companies are going to the wall because they have no contracts because the Government believe that is necessary to cut back on public expenditure. I do not accept that. Strictly speaking, the Government do not accept that either, as their spending record on armaments shows. Surely, that is wasteful expenditure. That does not help Britain's productivity. It may help certain arms manufacturers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative members ask where the money will come from and say that we cannot afford this, that or whatever. However, it has been estimated that, because of the Government's policy, lost production costs about £18 billion to £20 billion a year. That is a very costly, inefficient type of economy, thanks to monetarism. Monetarism means laying the blame on others, particularly the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment in council houses means investment in people. It is important that we invest money, and do not squander money on armaments. If I may put in a plug for my own constituency, more houses are needed in Leith. If the Under-Secretary does not agree with that, he should go there, because many parts look like Dresden after the Second World War, largely due to the Tory-controlled Edinburgh council, which is utterly indifferent to tenants' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why the Martello tower is so important to the local community is that it fell into disrepair because of bad management policy. Many other social problems resulted from the attitude of the local council. Therefore, it is not a question of private enterprise having the answer, but of local councillors facing up to their responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In any case, I believe that the next Labour Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
will be far more radical than the previous one, and that we shall see policies that reflect the aspirations of working people in Scotland and England.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. At least no one can accuse the Opposition of attempting to muzzle freedom of expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the most interesting points were made by Conservative Members. I shall deal with some points made by the Under-Secretary. I particularly welcome some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). I agree that there are serious problems in housing in Scotland. If I represented Argyll, I should be particularly aware of them, because, with 17-6 per cent, of its houses considered sub-tolerable, Argyll is one of the worst-affected authorities. I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's plea that party politics should be kept out of the housing debate. If I were a Conservative, I should certainly believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That theme has cropped up many times during our debate. I do not think that the little stand for principle of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) should go unremarked or unrewarded. He stated courageously that he was happy that in his part of Scotland there were independent councillors. I thought that he implied that he was glad that they were not Conservative councillors. The view that Conservatives should keep their grubby paws out of local government will bring much response from many Labour Members representing Scottish constituencies, but not from Conservative councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway attacked my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) on extraordinary grounds. He said that my hon. Friend had spoken of nothing but figures and that he did not have a feel for people and their problems. The Under-Secretary, rather embarrassingly, had taken an exactly opposite view a few minutes earlier. He accused my hon. Friend of being short on figures and long on the problems of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Member for Galloway has a bizarre view of the realities of housing in Scotland. As I understood it, he said that if a person cannot get suitably housed in the public sector he should go to the private sector. That view is as bizarre and extraordinary as that often put forward in housing debates by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) who is wont to say that people ought to buy their council houses in Drumchapel in order to sell them at a profit to buy country cottages in Macduff and places like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was merely pointing out that many of the 192,000 surplus properties are private houses

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
and that the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act strengthens the likelihood of those private houses being made available for letting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that anyone who works or lives in urban Scotland and comes across the problem of people offered a bad draw in the housing allocation because of the pressure on the decent stock of council housing, would find it insulting if we were to advise those people to move into the private sector. Housing in the private sector is not available at prices that people can afford. To sing the praise of what the hon. Gentleman describes as a new mobile Scotland is a remarkable abdication from the real world. The only force I can think of that is leading to availability in Scotland is increasing unemployment. Perhaps that is something that the hon. Gentleman does not want to dwell on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to other points raised by the Under-Secretary. I have tried hard to understand—I mean that genuinely—what Conservative housing policy is, apart from merely following the dictates of the Treasury. In order to be fair, I have tried not to look at what the Government are doing. I accept that, though they may not know what they are doing or appreciate the consequences of their actions, their intentions may be honourable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 18 May the Under-Secretary spoke in the debate instigated by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). From that we got an indication of the Government's intentions. It would not be a bad idea to spend a minute or two to look at how these intentions are working out in practice and whether the Government are living up to their own advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said the:
	<br><blockquote><p>"objective is to concentrate the resources available on the capital side of housing expenditure rather than on the revenue side."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 May 1981; Vol. 5, c.56.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that there should be a shift away from subsidising the individual tenant and that more money should be spent on capital investment. I understood that that was one of the kernels of his policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard that as almost an essay in black humour, given what the Government are doing in local authority finance. The Under-Secretary spoke of a shift away from subsidising the individual tenant. In the doublespeak and newspeak of the Government I presume that that means high rents. If we are to have high rents and what the Minister is suggesting, we should also have a new concentration on capital spending to allow us to attack the problems that Members have talked about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing capital allowance, having been calculated on the basis of need, has been docked by another £35 million. That would have made a considerable impact in several areas, given the demands that tenants are rightly making for improvements and for the raising of housing standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When tackled upon this remarkable innovation— the new form of Tory social justice which links
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
housing capital allowances to rents and penalises those who do not follow the dictates of the Secretary of State over rent—all that the Secretary of State could say, as he did in that debate, was words to the effect of " You're jolly lucky you didn't get another £20 million docked off you ". If that is what a shift towards capital expenditure and upon capital investment means, we are living in an Alice in Wonderland world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary's second point was that Conservative policy was intended to enhance the rights of tenants, whether they intended to buy or not, and it was also to end the segregation in our housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us directly to his challenges on council house sales. Conservative Members, particularly those who come from areas far removed from council housing, tend to boast in the House about the scores and thousands of people queueing up to buy their council houses. It is encouraging to the good burghers of Pollokshields and Newton Mearns to be told that in Drumchapel we are all aflame with enthusiasm at the opportunity to purchase our council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such enthusiasm exists, one would probably find names like Benjamin Disraeli and Mrs. M. Thatcher among the applicants, because people do not want to buy on the scale that is being suggested. The figure of 30,000 inquiries has now boiled down to a figure of about 16,500 applications to purchase, given in the Minister's most recent written answer—to a question yesterday from my hon. Friend for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). That is something like half the figure that was being bandied about in the House recently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"About 16,500 applications to purchase under the Act are currently in progress." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 July 1981; Vol. 7, 	<i>col. 404.</i>]</p></blockquote>
We are talking about sales under part I of the Tenant's Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act. While there will be a considerable impact, I do not think that it will be anything like as widespread as hon. Members are suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the MORI poll, I accept that if one asks " Should people have the right to buy their house? " the instinctive answer will be " Yes ". If one asks the much more important question " Do you, individually, want to buy your house? " one will find a rather different reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In polling, the whole art is asking the right question. If people in Scotland were asked not whether people should have the right to buy their own houses, but whether the law should force local authorities, irrespective of the demands of good management in their area, to sell, there might have been very different answers. If the question were " Shall we construct a scheme which encroaches upon the independence of local authorities and ensures that those who have already been fortunate

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
in the draw for council housing in the public sector shall be able to capitalise on that luck at the expense of the authorities? " one might again get a very different answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My protest—I think that all my hon. Friends here join me—is that local authorities are being bullied into a policy which will be counter-productive in social justice and in good management of the housing stock. It is all being done to satisfy the political prejudices of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I approve of the Glenelg experiment— because I believe that local authorities should have the freedom to carry out variations in policy as they see fit, and as they are elected to do by the people in their area. I welcome the fact that a Labour council in Glasgow decided to try a pilot project in Glenelg. It may surprise people, but by and large we try pilot projects in the hope that they will succeed. If this project proves a success there may be opportunities in other areas. No one wants to rule out the possibility of variety and experimentation—there is nothing sinister, and no political hostage there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a very interesting remark towards the end of his speech. He said that Labour Members
	<br><blockquote><p>" have not been prepared to grasp the radical solutions that are required to deal with some of the problems. They have been able to think only in terms of resources."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 May 1981; Vol. 4, c. 59.]</p></blockquote>
I believe, and the Minister admitted, that resources are vital. I believe that the idea that we have been forced to think in terms of resources is not an accusation but a tribute to the proper approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may have all sorts of good intentions. The Government may think of all sorts of dreams about what they can do with the housing stock. But if they are not prepared to make the resources available, it will all turn out to be dust and ashes and they will have raised expectations in a way that is positively dangerous and divisive and will increase the current cynicism in the country about politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play with page 34 of the 1977 Green Paper and the fact that local authority investment figures were scheduled to decline. It is not just a matter of picking out one carefully laundered statistic on which to base a case. The point is that housing expenditure was about to rise. There was a substantial shift from direct investment by local authorities towards rehabilitation work through housing associations. However, the important consideration was that the resources which the then Labour Government were planning were about to increase from £577 million in 1975-76 to £680 million. The total housing expenditure figure, including grants for housing associations, local government, new towns and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cruel fact is that £687 million will be whittled down to £460 million by 1983-84. It does not matter how the Minister turns or twists. It does not matter how he plays with the figures so selectively. He was shown up badly by his hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who was prepared to consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
the matter in a slightly more honest way and accept that it was a complicated one making the balance between subsidy for a council house tenant as against the holder of a mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear who is better off, but the Minister tried to pretend that it was clear by taking some highly suspect figures and suggesting that the traffic was always one-way. I think that the hon. Member for Argyll has done us a service by pointing out that the Minister's case was an over-simplification bordering on the dishonest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are continuing to cut bitterly into the resources available. While they continue to do that, it does not matter what schemes are erected or what glosses are put on the facts; the tenants of Scotland will suffer from higher rents, poorer services and worse housing conditions. The Minister set a record in 1980 when new building was down by 29 per cent., private sector starts were the lowest for the decade, and public sector starts were the lowest since the War. If that is the record that he wishes to leave behind, he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) appears to share the views of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Brown). Neither was prepared to defend the proposed expenditure of the last Labour Government whereby investment on housing by local authorities was set to decline over the years from 1975 to 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden said that total expenditure was predicted to increase by £45 million. He has not pointed out that more than that—£54 million—was an increase in public sector subsidies for tenants. It was proposed that local authority investment would fall constantly from £228 million to £188 million—about £40 million less. The hon. Gentleman has not defended that fact. The hon. Member for Leith has not defended that. Not one Labour Member has defended the objectives of both the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and the previous Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were given a more honest view by the hon. Member for Leith. His comment on the last Labour Government was that two wrongs did not make a right. The fact that their housing policy was a disastrous failure should not excuse what in his view is the present Government's failure. He was more honest because he did not seek to repudiate what the hon. Member for Garscadden and his hon. Friends were responsible for. The attitude of the hon. Member for Garscadden is disgraceful, and he should be ashamed of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may reply to the specific points raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Provan mentioned private sector completions in the last year. He will be interested to know that, in the first quarter of this year, private sector starts were 40 per cent, above the last quarter of last year, which is a very encouraging sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked about receipts from sales being included in a local authority's proposed allocation. We wish to achieve a situation where net capital allocations will allow an authority to buy a house, improve it and sell it again within the same year without having to use a penny of its allocation. At present, the cost of buying and improving such houses comes from an authority's existing allocation. Therefore, we share the hon. Gentleman's objective to move in the direction that he suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan also rightly mentioned the serious problems faced by Glasgow on housing. When we consider the capital available to Glasgow, we must take into account the enormous amount that Glasgow chooses to spend per house on repairs and maintenance. That figure is far in excess of that of any other Scottish local authority, including those with comparable problems. The Scottish average amount spent on repairs and maintenance per house is £175. In Dunbarton the figure is £202, in Hamilton £228, in Monklands £173, in Motherwell £174, but in Glasgow it is £287. Although that authority has very serious problems, they are not dramatically different from those of many other West of Scotland industrial areas where the local authorities spend nothing remotely like that amount per house on repairs and maintenance. That figure has been increasing in the last few years, not going down, and serious thought must be given to whether it is good value for money. If those huge sums are being spent year-in and year-out and Glasgow's housing does not appear to be re-monstrably improved as a result, that suggests that it is not perhaps the most appropriate way to approach the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Provan for homesteading, and I welcome what the hon. Member for Garscadden said on that matter. There is no doubt that this should be a bi-partisan issue. No one should be reluctant that empty houses that tenants do not wish to occupy should be made available to those who are willing and able to use them and stop them being vandalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) was correct to point out that short tenancies, as provided for in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, can be a means of ensuring that vacant houses in the private sector are now made available to those on waiting lists and to those on low incomes. The private sector has a part to play in short tenancies for those on low incomes who cannot afford to buy their houses, and there has already been considerable interest in that respect in Glasgow, which is an encouraging sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) bemoaned the state of the construction industry in Dundee. He cannot ignore the fact that Dundee could have had an extra £3 million to spend on housing investment if it had been prepared to move on its decision to refuse to increase rents. The level of rent increase that Dundee would have been required to make to get its full capital allocation was less than £1, which is far less than the Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
average. If it chooses not to do that for doctrinaire reasons, it must accept some of the responsibility for the capital consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not give way to me. I hope that he will understand that I shall not give way, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also spoke of the need to spend money on improvements in the private sector in Dundee because of subtolerable housing. He will be interested to know that Dundee district council received on its non-housing revenue account an increased allocation for the current year from £2^ million to £3 million. The fact that we did that shows that we have no political vendetta against Dundee. We have been perfectly prepared to give an increased allocation in both aspects of its expenditure and in the non-housing revenue side that was provided in a way that will give considerable benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) rightly pointed to the Strathclyde region structure plan and the fact that it indicated a growing crude surplus. He asked about the particular problem of shops and tenements that require comprehensive rehabilitation. The Scottish Development Department, jointly with the Housing Corporation and the Scottish Development Agency, has engaged a firm' of research consultants to carry out a study into the practical and legal problems with a view to establishing a new approach in this area, because we recognise that it is a genuine problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith spoke of rent increases as being simply a means of helping the public sector borrowing requirement. The linkage between the two was to enable us to have a capital allocation that would not have been available if rent increases had been on the levels that had existed in earlier years. The linkage was established because we wished to avoid that, and the response of an overwhelming number of Scottish local authorities showed that they had agreed that capital allocations were a greater priority, even if it meant rent increases that they might have preferred not to impose. The vast majority of them made that choice, and I welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gascadden referred to the 16,500 applications being considered for purchase of council houses. Those figures apply to local authority houses. To those should be added the figures for the Scottish Special Housing Association—where 200 applications a month are still coming in—and the new towns and sales completed since May 1979. The grand total comes to 34,000 to 35,000, which is the figure that I gave when I was asked about it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that it was all very well asking tenants whether they would like to buy their homes; the important thing was not whether they felt that there should be a right, but whether they had any intention of exercising that right. Even in those terms the figures are revealing. Of those asked, 12 per cent, said that they were very interested
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
in purchasing their homes—and that means 120,000 tenants in Scotland out of 1 million. Another 12 per cent, said that they were fairly interested. That is the potential interest of all public sector tenants in Scotland. If that interest were realised, it would mean 250,000 houses in the public sector which would go into owner-occupation. The Government have not said that they expect such a figure to be achieved. Of course, in the end, not all these people will purchase their homes. Even if less than half of that figure is reached—100,000 over the course of the next two or three years—it will be a substantial achievement and the Government will be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that houses must be sold irrespective of the wishes of tenants, but, if tenants want to buy, they should have the right to do so. That is the view of the tenants, even those who voted Labour. That fact cannot be avoided by the hon. Member for Garscadden, and he must accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member steadfastly refused to respond to the main question that I put to him. I asked him specifically what his attitude was towards the reduction in local authority investment that occurred under the previous Labour Government and that was projected to continue over the next few years up to the current year. He has given no response on that, and I know why—it is because he cannot. He knows that it would mean either attacking the Labour Government, which he is not prepared to do in public, or supporting the Labour Government, which would be contrary to the views put forward by his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact remains that in local authority investment, which is where the Government face the fiercest criticism from the Opposition, there was a proposed reduction of some £40 million for the period 1975-81, and there was a reduction while the Labour Government were in power, but the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends still refuse to say whether they suport that policy and whether they wish to see it continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the Opposition, and my hon. Friends have asked hon. Members, to explain their current policy. Do they wish to see a massive increase in local authority investment in housing in Scotland? We know that the hon. Members for Leith and Dundee, West do, because they have never said anything to the contrary. That has been their view all along. We know that some other hon. Members no doubt will. But what is the view of the hon. Member for Garscadden, and what is the view of the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
Millan), who is sitting doing his homework at the moment rather than listening to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Party favours reversing the drift away from investment in housing. It is a matter for argument whether it should be done, as it was in those figures, by increasing, for example, housing association allocations, or to what extent it should be done by an increase in investment in local authorities. It is important that it should be done if there is not to be a further deterioration in the housing stock. There is all the difference in the world between a Government who want to cut public spending on housing because they are against public spending on housing, and a Government who on occasions have had to listen to financial dictates and financial reality. We believe in it, the Government do not believe in it, and that is why we shall have support in Scotland and the Government will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important admission, because it appears from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that the Labour Party has not yet made up its mind whether it wishes to see a major increase in local authority capital investment. It knows that it wants more spent on housing in Scotland, but it has not decided on the balance between private and public. It has not decided whether it wants to reverse the policy of the previous Labour Government. It has not come to a view on the matter, but that has never been admitted before the hon. Gentleman made that intervention. It was a most revealing remark, because it shows that at least the hon. Member for Garscadden accepts that slight element of reality which his hon. Friends do not share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will continue much of the policy of the previous Labour Government. We shall continue the policy of the Green Paper on housing, concentrating, as my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll said, on selective needs, and on improvements in sheltered housing and on meeting the needs of single persons. What we shall not do, and what the previous Labour Government would not have done, is to embark on a massive increase in housing expenditure for local authorities, which the Green Paper indicated was not necessary, which the Opposition know is not necessary, and which the hon. Member for Garscadden has clearly indicated that any Labour Government would not pursue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
