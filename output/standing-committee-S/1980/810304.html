	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Countryside (Scotland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Peter Fraser.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to encourage my hon. Friends in their massed ranks to oppose the motion, which seems eminently reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I extend to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) my congratulations on the now rare achievement in Scottish politics of getting a Private Member's Bill over the first hurdle. I am very glad that the anonymouse calls of "Object", which usually come from, behind or around him were absent for this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I speak for my hon. Friends when I say that we have no intention of obstructing the Bill, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that, as he has such a flying start in the Private Member's procedure, we have time to give the Bill a decent Committee Stage. For us that will largely be a matter of probing and trying to discover the implications of some of the very technical changes embodied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will appreciate that, as there was no Second Reading, there has been no explanation of principle or laying out of the reasons behind the measure. I appreciate that it comes from a working party convened by the Scottish Development Department, to which reference is made in the Countryside Commission report, but we shall want, even if only in brief clause stand part debates, to hear a little about the reasons for some of these developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will have a constructive and not too prolonged Committee stage, in spite of being a Bill of such scope. Given the fact that the Countryside Commission—I say this is in a neutral sense—attracts a certain amount of controversy on some aspects of its activities in Scotland, we cannot allow the Bill to go through with only cursory consideration. That is how we intend to approach the Bill and I should be happy to let the sittings motion go through on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.John Home Robertson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of the sponsors of the Bill, it would be quite improper for me to do anything to obstruct its passage. However, I should like the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to bear in mind, as our sittings go on—I hope not for too many weeks—that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs is also inclined to meet on Wednesday morn-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
ings. As far as I know, six members of the Select Committee, including myself, are also serving on this Standing Committee. Therefore, I hope that we shall not take up too much time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Countryside (Scotland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF DISTRICT AND ISLANDS COUNCILS TO CONTROL NOISE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 6, leave out "and aircraft".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> With this we shall also discuss amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 12, leave out paragraph (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient if I say that I have one or two general points to make on clause 1, some of which will be made on this group of amendments. I hope that that will preclude the necessity for me to speak again in a stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 is one of the clauses which made me raise my eyebrows slightly when I first read it, as it is drafted remarkably widely. The key sentence reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'For the purpose of preventing disturbance by the engine noise of vehicles and aircraft to the enjoyment by the public of quiet areas of the countryside, district and islands councils shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, have power by bye-laws to control—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<ol>
	<li>the use on land or waterways of vehicles (including hovercraft and boats); and</li>
	<li>the landing and taking off of aircraft."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This is a very wide power at one level but at another level it is strangely limited, because it does refer not to noise in general but to the noise of specific kinds of engines. I am rather curious about the basis on which this was included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also curious about whether there is not a fair amount of statutory authority that would have allowed a local authority to move against excessive engine noise without having to introduce this new provision in this amending Bill. I want to be satisfied in general terms—perhaps this is a matter for clause stand part, but it may be convenient to discuss it now—that we really need this additional statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discovered from my very slight experience in these matters that when one gets involved in planning law and legislation like amenity law it is often difficult to define the statutory authority for a particular action by a local authority or another body. One can spend many hours looking at what appear to be overlapping statutory provisions and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
can get totally lost. The particular defined need for one provision is often not terribly clear. I am not convinced that this new power which is very sweeping generally for engine noise is not covered by some other statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman explain the gap that makes this clause essential?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten on to the amendments before I incur your wrath, Mr. Lamond. They delete the words " and aircraft" and paragraph "	<i>(b)</i> the landing and taking off of aircraft". It seems a very specific power which I would have thought could have been controlled under all sorts of other regulations and statutes. Presumably, with low-flying aircraft, we think immediately of defence exercises. I am not clear whether we are envisaging a situation in which a district council, bless it, will start making by-laws prohibiting the RAF from exercising—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, all right. But is that what is envisaged? If that power is possible, it is of great interest to us. I suspect that it is not because Crown servants acting in the course of their duty would be ruled out. If that is not covered, presumably we are thinking of airfields and the landing and taking off of aircraft from an airport or an airfield which is in a country district. Will the hon. Gentleman give us examples of exactly where that would be? Few people use helicopters from their front gardens and I should have thought that if it were a matter of landing aircraft on airfields, the Countryside (Scotland) Bill was not the right place to take these powers. Presumably there is a plethora of legislation controlling aircraft movements and what happens at airports, which would be more appropriate. I am rather curious about why it is necessary to have these provisions for aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the noise of, for example, traffic or machinery—agricultural machinery would be excluded, but we shall come to that—or of someone setting up some sort of nuisance in that sphere can happen anywhere and an individual can be responsible for it. However, I should have thought that the landing of aircraft is more appropriately dealt with under air traffic regulation instead of countryside regulation. I am a little sceptical about this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point, perhaps I may ask, on the other side of the argument, about a matter which may sound a little comic but which has been genuinely raised with me by a planning officer in a district council, who wanted to know whether the landing and taking off of aircraft would include model aircraft. That sounds most extraordinary but I have on occasions—I do not wish to go into the realms of personal experience, which is sometimes laughed at—been sitting in a quiet place when suddenly this appalling drone, as if from a kind of monstrous dragonfly, starts up. One looks round and there is some wretched person with a model aircraft on the end of a piece of string going round endlessly making the whole atmosphere hideous
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
with the buzz. That is a minor point, but one which is worth raising to see whether the Bill would cover model aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of the amendment is to suggest that there is no necessity to include aircraft in this legislation and that their inclusion is anomalous. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would say something about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I rise to oppose my hon. Friend's amendments. Two kinds of aircraft make offensive noise in those remote rural areas which the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) seeks to protect and I would like to see both categories of aircraft brought under control by the Bill. First, there are the model aircraft to which my hon. Friend has already referred. They are aircraft like any others—they take off, they land, they make a lot of noise and, presumably, they will come under the control of the Bill. I think that that is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the clause does not go far enough because it does not make it possible for the noise generated by the Royal Air Force to be criticised or brought under control. When walking round the quiet remote areas of the Lammermuir hills in my constituency, I find that most disturbing noise there is made by the low-flying aircraft of the RAF, the Lutfwaffe, the El Salvador air force or anybody else who happens to be training in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such aircraft, which perpetrate the bulk of the offensive noise in rural areas in Scotland are excluded from the provisions of the Bill under clause 1(2)(a) which excludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"crown servants acting in the course of their duty"</p></blockquote>
That could be unduly burdensome on some private aircraft operators who do not bother anybody much, while exempting these maniacs flying round at fence-top level from any criticism or control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency there is an RAF base which accounts for about a third of the Royal Air Force's fighter power. I take deep exception to the hon. Gentleman's use—in his otherwise reasonable remarks—of the words " maniacs " flying round at " tree-top level". The pilots are extremely skilful and level-headed and thank I God for it. If they were not so level-headed, sane and sensible in me performance of their duties we would be in far more sever difficulties than we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's concern, but I think that, on reflection, he will agree that it is absurd to grant district councils the power to decide the defence capability of the nation. Some district councils under some political parties are not always as wise as some of us would think appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke about the general purport of the clause. Although it might be more appropriately be part of a stand part debate, perhaps I might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
explain the context in which the aircraft inclusion falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland in recent years there has been increasing concern that there is a threat of a disturbance of the " quiet areas " of the countryside—to quote the clause—due to noise from engines, whether of motorised vehicles on the land, Sno-Cats, aircraft or boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already in Scotland a number of powers to deal with the problem. First, if there were regular use on an identifiable piece of land and the activity continued weekend after weekend, it would be subject—apart from anything ense—to planning control, because that use of the land would fall within the planning Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, powers already exist which allow local authorities to control regular noise. Also, the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 in section 56 gives the local planning authority powers to make byelaws in respect of pleasure boats, but these are in the sea or relating to the seashore, so that is a limited power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is causing concern in Scotland now is that a threat from such things as Sno-Cats and pleasure boats with water skiers on lochs. No attempt is being made to restrict wholly the use of such boats and snowcats, but they constitute a threat to those people who might reasonably expect, when they go into the quieter parts of the Scottish countryside, to be free from the intrusion of loud noise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Member for Garscaddon a particular example of what I have in mind. It does not necessarily follow that it would be restricted by the local planning authority, but it could be. In the Cairngorms or Glen Coe one might find helicopters being used to take skiers richer than one generally finds in Scotland to the Grampian mass and away from the drag tows and so on. Helicopters might be used to lift them to heights where they could ski on powder snow and fresh snow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a problem were to become excessive, Scottish planning authorities feel that they should be given at least the opportunity to impose controls. But I must emphasise that the power suggested here is limited and not one that would extend to Scotland generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked specifically what powers exist under general aviation legislation. He is quite right: there is already civil aviation legislation controlling the low flying of aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Civil aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Civil aircraft. An elaborate formula prohibits aircraft from flying at less than 500 ft. within a circumference of about 5,000 yds. We are not seeking to intrude on that legislation or to attempt to duplicate powers that already exist. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is only the taking off and landing of such aircraft on the mountainside, whether in the Lawers range or the Grampian range that the Bill seeks to restrict. In those circumstances it would deal with casual takeoff and landing and would not relate to the use of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
airfields, because those would already be covered under planning law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point raised by the hon. Gentleman is the problem of model aircraft. If it were intended here to impose a control on model aircraft, they would have been spelt out as "model aircraft" or "models" generally. The clause relates to aircraft which are capable of carrying people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that this term "aircraft" does not cover model aircraft? I should have thought that, under the definition of aircraft, a powered machine capable of flying would be an aircraft. It would cover any sort of machine, including model aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that in the statutory definition of "aircraft" there is a distinction between model aircraft and aircraft capable of carrying one or more persons. If the Bill had been intended to cover model aircraft, it would have had to spell them out separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I hope that the hon. Member for Garscadden does not feel that it is necessary to press these amendments to exclude the mention of aircraft from clause 1(1). It is something that it seems right to leave to local authorities to determine for themselves, should they find that it is a growing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend can help me on another point about aircraft. Does the definition include—I ask this question in all seriousness—balloons, which carry a number of passengers and which also, for those members of the Committee who have not seen or heard them, make a considerable noise because of the fuel injection system and the burner that they use to get height?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1(1) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"preventing disturbance by the engine noise of vehicles and aircraft".</p></blockquote>
So far as I am aware, a burner on a balloon would not properly be described as an engine, which would require moving parts rather than simply a valve that allowed the escape of gas to be ignited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not inted to press these amendments, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not take it amiss if I say that the more that I hear about the clause, the more I am worried about it and whether it is worth all the trouble. We are writing into the Bill a very wide power for local authorities—we shall come to this matter on the next amendment, and I refer to it only in passing—which is defined geographically only in the most vague of terms—
	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside",</p></blockquote>
Yet it is apparently justified by the possibility of helicopters putting people on to powder snow in specific areas of the country.

I hope that I am not being unreasonable when I say that I have a prejudice, which is probably shared by a number of Government Members against general enabling powers to make byelaws,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
unless there is a proven need for them and the power is limited to answering that proven need. Perhaps we shall now have to come to this point on clause stand part, but at the moment I am not convinced that this need is established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is particularly so in view of the general powers already in the Countryside (Scotland) Act providing many ways in which certain areas can be designated as country parks, or perhaps, as under clause 5, as regional parks or as access areas, for which there are wide byelaw powers under section 54 of the Act, and so on. At the moment I remain very unconvinced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is not meant to deal even with airfields—we are now on common ground that there are better ways of doing that—and if it is not designed to deal with frequent, regular occurrences at one geographical spot—the planning laws can deal with that—the words "and aircraft" become very narrow and difficult to justify in terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never gone ballooning and have only seen it in films. It is perhaps too aristocratic a pastime for me. Also, I associate balloons with stately homes. But I am not sure whether balloons are a menace. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) described the occasional abuse of aircraft but I should have thought that model aircraft were probably more of a natural, everyday menace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to allow the provision to survive, it would be worth considering writing in a specific provision to cover model aircraft if the statutory definition of "aircraft"—there is no definition in the Bill at the moment—is held to exclude them in general terms. If we take out the words " and aircraft", we shall probably have nothing left in the clause. However, reserving my position on the clause as a whole, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is again part of the same general debate about the worth of the clause. I am a little alarmed about the phraseology here. Clause 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of preventing disturbance by the engine noise of vehicles …to the enjoyment by the public of quiet areas of the countryside"</p></blockquote>
I do not know what
	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside"</p></blockquote>
are. That may sound ludicrous, because clearly anyone can define the words "quiet", "area" and "countryside". Indeed, if we are worried about the word "countryside", we can go to section 2 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act, which will tell us what it is. "Countryside", you will be glad to know, Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Lamond, is an area designated by the Secretary of State on a map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know to what extent countryside areas have been designated throughout Scotland. I should know; it is part of my education process. But, section 2(1) of the 1967 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act ' the countryside ' means the areas which are for the time being designated as such on maps prepared and approved by the Secretary of State in accordance with"</p></blockquote>
the subsections that follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear to me whether " countryside " in the context of the " quiet areas of the countryside " is the statutory definition of " countryside "—that is, a defined area on a map approved by the Secretary of State—or whether we are considering the word " countryside " in the layman's term of any place which has trees, cows, farmers and other strange beasts inhabiting it and is not full of Glasgow corporation council houses. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) will clear up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to "quiet areas". It is important that one has a statutory concept of these terms if one is giving special powers to local authorities to make byelaws, override normal planning procedures and so on. If we had to define "countryside", I wonder what "quiet areas" means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To us another example, section 10(2) of the 1967 Act contains what is perhaps another reasonable, layman's concept—" open country". But it has been found necessary in that Act to define "open country". It is country which consists
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor, heath, hill, woodland, cliff or foreshore, with the waterways therein or contiguous or adjacent thereto (including any bank, barrier, dune, beach, flat or other land adjacent to the waterway or foreshore)."</p></blockquote>
It sounds like one of the duller passages from one of Sir Walter Scott's heavier novels, if I may say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am making the serious point that when the Government put the 1967 Act on the statute book, they had to define the term "countryside",—perhaps in a rather limited way by saying that they would make maps to delimit the term. When they came to "open countryside" they had to give a description, which presumably was an attempt to limit the powers that could be taken in open countryside—access agreements and so on—so that people knew where it could be done and in what circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a blanket power to make byelaws—it is my experience that there are far too many byelaws in this world, which often overlap in their general intent—and that we are to do so in
	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside".</p></blockquote>
Presumably, the term "quiet areas", as it is not defined purely means the subjective view of the district council in question. I suppose that "quiet" is a comparative term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment merely to try to find out from the hon. Member for South Angus whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
we are dealing here with a limitless concept. Presumably common sense would say that one could not do it in a built-up area. To what extent does "quiet area" qualify "countryside"? In my view countryside is all quiet, if it is still countryside and not built up, except for something specific such as a sawmill in a field. I think of all countryside areas as being quiet. I therefore wonder what quiet countryside is as distinct from non-quiet countryside. If the phrase is meaningless, as I suspect it is, this power can be used in any country area. I presume that any country area means one that has been designed under section 2 of the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to show the area of anxiety and my wish for further definition. I look forward with interest to what the hon. Gentleman has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Gar-scadden (Mr. Dewar) in relation to the meaning of the term "countryside" in clause 1. If the hon. Gentleman looks at clause 17 of the Bill he will see that this Bill when enacted and the Act of 1967 are to be construed as one. Therefore, all other things being equal, the assumption is that when considering this clause, one looks back to the 1967 Act to see what is meant by "countryside". As the hon. Gentleman has already indicated, a statutory definition is given in section 2 of the 1967 Act of the meaning of "countryside" in this legislation. I advise the hon. Gentleman that, with the exception of the major urban areas of Scotland—I do not think that I need to go into them as they are self-evident—the rest of Scotland has already been designated as countryside. It is not as if a third of the map has been designated as countryside whereas other rural areas of Scotland, if I may so describe them, have not been designated as countryside for the purposes of the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the term "quiet areas" has no statutory definition in the way that the countryside or open country is statutorily defined in the 1967 Act. He is right in his assumption that it would be for the planning authority to determine these areas itself to see whether it was appropriate to seek powers by law over some aspect of their area. This was a matter of considerable discussion with COSLA, the NFU, the Scottish Landowners Federation and a large number of bodies in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be made clear that it is not seen that this power would be used extensively or would be permitted to be used extensively. If any byelaws are made under this Act or if an application is made to have byelaws covering this problem, they would in turn be subject to the general procedure regulating the making of byelaws imposed on all local authorities in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The byelaws must go back to the Secretary of State at one point in their formation for his control. I assure the hon. Gentleman that local
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
authorities would not be put in a position to describe themselves in large measure as quiet areas and then impose these byelaws regulating noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray and Nairn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there may still be a risk of some discrimination in the measure as presently drafted? For instance, if I were an advocate living in, say Ainslie Place in Edinburgh, I might be able to cut my grass with a Flymo on a Sunday morning with impunity. However, if I were an advocate who had taken up politics and was now living in a quite area of the countryside, say somewhere near Car-myllie in Angus, it is possible that any grass-cutting machine I had would be struck at by this legislation because that hardly comes within the exemption of
	<br><blockquote><p>"management of the land for agriculture, forestry, or sport".</p></blockquote>
I might merely be cutting the grass merely to make it look neat for some interview with a lady's magazine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for that constructive intervention and for his concern for his hypothetical advocate who for some reason left the prosperity of the new town and resorted to the poverty-stricken rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are discussing the engine noise of vehicles. The activities of a hypothetical urban resident who has moved to the countryside with either a power saw or a lawnmower, or whatever would in no way be restricted by the byelaws even if the local authority were to make the quiet areas larger than envisaged by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Member for Garscadden that it would be appropriate for a local authority to consider the imposition of the byelaws, not only where there are quiet areas, but also where the public might seek recreational enjoyment. That distinction should be drawn. The measure concerns areas such as the Perthshire hills or the Grampians where it is quiet at present. People resort to those areas because it is quiet and peaceful and their enjoyment should not be interrupted by helicopters or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he found it difficult to see what exactly was being covered, but in parts of Highland Scotland at the moment, there is a real risk of vehicles such as Sno-Cats causing problems. Anyone who bought a Sno-Cat this winter would not have made a worthwhile investment, but they are extremely noisy and if the problem increased and they were allowed to roam without restriction, it would seem appropriate to grant this limited power to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, an attempt to give a statutory definition to the term ' quiet area" would create extraordinary problems. We would have to study the map of Scotland and attempt to determine what is at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas aircraft may be the problem; in others, it may be Sno-Cats; in yet others it may be scrambler bikes. Although everyone might agree that a piece of countryside was undisturbed at present, it would be far too complex to attempt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
to provide a definition which would cover all areas where such activities might take place. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that since all byelaws are to be made with reference to the Secretary of State, that will be an adequate safeguard and will mean that local authorities will not use the power too extensively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion I am inclined to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). The more I look at the clause, the more it seems like a child's definition of a net—a set of loopholes tied together with string.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term
	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside"</p></blockquote>
appears to be a let-out for almost anyone subject to the noise control provision. A court prosecution could be challenged on that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
" Quiet areas " in the countryside would, in effect, exclude any field in which a tractor or combine harvester ever travels. As the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Myles) knows, tractors and combines make a lot of noise. So if the Sno-Cat operator envisaged by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) was travelling across a field in midwinter and was told by the local authority that the Sno-Cat was making far too much noise, he could easily say that a few months earlier a great deal more noise had been generated in that quiet field by a combine harvester or by a tractor following it. That let-out could make the clause more or less useless, and my hon. Friend is doing the Committee a service by giving us the opportunity to take this qualification out. If the qualification is retained, the clause might as well not be put on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful if I make a short intervention. Clearly, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has indicated, any regulations that the local authority wishes to introduce under the clause will be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, and it may be helpful if I indicate the basis on which the Secretary of State would be inclined to consider any such regulations that were submitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) wondered how one could know to what areas the phrase 	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside"</p></blockquote>
is intended to refer. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus pointed out, the whole of Scotland other than the major urban areas has been designated as countryside. Clearly, that definition covers many parts of Scotland that could not legitimately be described as quiet areas. For example, all the small towns outwith the major urban areas are included in the designated countryside of Scotland; yet a small town or village could not properly be considered a quiet area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, there are two considerations that one must take into account and that my right hon. Friend would certainly take into account in con
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
sidering any regulations submitted to him. First, he would consider whether the area was in fact quiet. He would adopt a common-sense approach to that concept. The idea of quietness is not destroyed by the fact that very occasionally there may be a tractor or some other source of noise in the area. The question would be whether in general terms the area was a quiet part of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that my right hon. Friend would consider is highly relevant and is referred to. in the clause, which states that the purpose of the regulations is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the enjoyment by the public of quiet areas of the countryside".</p></blockquote>
If, therefore, the area in question was one whose quietness the public did not wish to enjoy, it would be difficult to argue that the regulations were appropriate. If we were talking about some desolate part of Scotland which might be extremely quiet but which no one ever visited or wished to visit, and if there was no suggestion that the public sought to gain the enjoyment of the quietness of that area, I think it would be very difficult for a local authority to suggest that it was necessary or desirable to have regulations to cover noise there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both those questions—whether the area could legitimately be considered a quiet area of the countryside, and, equally important, whether the evidence available to the local authority and to my right hon. Friend indicates that the public either enjoy or wish to enjoy the area—would therefore be taken into account both in the clause itself and in the way in which my right hon. Friend would consider regulations submitted to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that no local authority would wish to act in an arbitrary way, but if one did wish to do so, that safeguard is there. I think that the Committee can therefore be assured that this measure is a sensible contribution towards dealing with what in a number of specific areas could be said to damage to a significant degree the public's enjoyment of the beauties of the countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My doubts about the whole concept are manifest, and may become more manifest in a short while, but I can see the force of what has been said. If the countryside includes everything except the major urban conurbations, however ill-defined that is and however difficult to envisage in terms of boundaries, any qualification is probably of some help as a guide to local authorities and to the Secretary of State if he uses his powers under the 1973 Act when byelaws are presented to him. On reflection, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 21, leave out "or sport".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment has become important in the past few minutes. I have listened with great care to a number of suggestions about what might be caught by this power. We know that model aircraft will not be caught, which I believe that the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
regrets, although it sounds a small point. We know that the lawn mower of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) will not be caught, because it is not a " vehicle " within the terms envisaged. Obviously it will not catch cars which are taking members of the public to the quiet places that they want to enjoy, because that would ensure that no one would ever enjoy the quiet places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only positive examples that have been given—I am not being sarcastic—are Sno-Cats, people being brought by helicopter—presumably affluent people but I hope that that facility will be increasingly available—to powder snow areas in the high peaks, and possibly motocross,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific exemption is sport. Motocross is clearly sport. I suspect that most use of Sno-Cats is recreational enjoyment and might be sport or carrying to sport, and certainly the use of helicopters, as described, is directly related to	<div class='sup'>;</div> <!-- sup --> sport. So every specific example of vehicle noise which has been advanced concerns sport. The hon. Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) suggested water ski-ing, and I agree with him. Every example in the thin list that we have been able to dredge up is related to sport and therefore would not be covered by the byelaws that might be made under this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, other important exclusions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"owners, occupiers or tenants of the land, or owners of an interest in the land".</p></blockquote>
So if anyone wanted to develop land for reasons of recreation, or sport and was himself running the machines, he would be exempted. In other words, if I own a Highland estate and I discover that there are enormous possibilities for, say, hang gliding on a commercial basis, but that in order to get people to the hang gliding spot I have to ferry them by helicopter or by Sno-Cat, presumably if we took out " or sport" as I am suggesting, it still would not be covered by the byelaws because it would be the owner or occupier of the land who was creating the noise and running the vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I must hammer at the point. What we are proposing to put on the statute book looks like a wide power, adds complications of finding a way through amenity legislation and produces the possibility of another thicket of byelaws, but it is almost useless. The exemption of sport is particularly important because it strikes at every example that the hon. Member has been able to give so far in the debate. If the exemption is retained, the subsection it not worth the paper on which it is written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are also serious implications in accepting the amendment, because it would mean that an owner who was developing his land legitimately might—I only say " might", because it is to be hoped that local authorities would be more sensible than to inhibit genuine development—find his commercial activities unnecessarily inhibited, because it was considered to be a quiet area where people should not be coming to Sno-Cat about or ski. The survival of the exemption for sport drives

a coach and horses through the concept. I suggest that the hon. Member should look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to a coach and horses which is perhaps a useful coat hanger for my point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is something to ask the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). The ingenuity with which the hon. Member produces these examples is diverting, but his points are serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know someone who is a steam engine enthusiast. He inherited an engine in an engineering shed, spent a lot of money and then sold it—I may say, at a handsome profit. He enjoyed cranking around in it. It was very noisy, and quite clearly a vehicle in terms of the Bill. He did not drive his down Sauchie-hall Street. He had it in the countryside, but whether a part that fell within the definition of a quiet area I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether that was a sport. It is certainly an enthusiasm, and might be a sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not be
	<br><blockquote><p>"the management of the land for agriculture…or sport."</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting point and one that the hon. Member can address himself to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which has risen tangentially out of the hon. Gentleman's last—sedentary—remark about management is important. It is not just the sport itself, such as motocross going round and round but the preparatory work of getting people to the site, or the helicopter taking the skier to the higher slopes, which would be specifically struck at by the drafting of the clause as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member made a very useful little intervention in drawing attention to that fact. It underlines my doubts and objections to the clause as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should feel very concerned if the amendment were accepted because all light aircraft flying comes into the category of a recreation or sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be deeply concerned if people who indulge in light aircraft flying were affected. I should add that flying power gliders—self-launching gliders—and hang gliders are sports. If any of those were to be open to tight additional restrictions from a local authority I should be concerned. They are, of course, already covered under various other Acts. One cannot use them willy-nilly: one must meet certain insurance requirements and also have minimum qualifications for certain activities under the auspices of the bodies which operate the sports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we delete "or sport" from the clause it will mean that all the activities that I have mentioned will be open to regulation by a local authority to prohibit them. One can fly a glider from any

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would he agree that if we leave " or sport" in as an extension it is difficult to see what genuine noise hazard could be struck at? As the clause is drafted, with the exemption, what hazard or movement of vehicle could legitimately be affected by a byelaw? I know that the hon. Gentleman is interested in this subject. I see in the last report of the Countryside Commission for Scotland a glowing reference to useful talks between himself and the commission, whose headquarters are in his constituency.

If the hon. Gentleman is arguing for the retention, and therefore the safety, of these activities, an example of what he thinks could usefully be struck at by a byelaw under this Act would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Michael Martin	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). Most of the discussion this morning has related to areas in the North of Scotland, but I am fortunate in that only four miles from my constituency in Glasgow is an area of quiet countryside known as Baldernock. It is amazing when one is in that area to think that one is only one mile from the Glasgow city boundary. Yet that area has been preserved. It has a very old churchyard, an old school house and a beautiful network of roads, together with a large piece of moorland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area has been preserved because the local people take great pride in it. Their only problem at the moment is motor cycle scramblers. Motor cyclists tend to come up and use the network of roads to run all over the place, causing a great deal of harm and damage. If one makes an exemption for sport, it could be legitimately argued that motor cycle scrambling is a sport. Therefore, the people of
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Baldernock would have no ability to go to the local authority and ask for a byelaw restricting this type of activity. Yet, for the sake of a minority, a large majority of people will be inconvenienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only person in Springburn who can go to that area, leave his car and walk around for many hours and enjoy the countryside. It is not the noise that they object to—I do not think that anyone would object to the noise of a motor cycle—but the fact that there is a good chance of being knocked down. People go into these areas so that they can be free from heavy traffic and they do not want to see a motor cycle coming at them at 60 miles an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can argue that, if the clause remains in the Bill, such activities as rally-driving and motor-cycle scrambling will go unrestricted, which would be extremely unfair and would cause havoc in areas such as Baldernock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause does not refer to the use of the land for sport but to the management of the land for sport. I had presumed that all the examples brought up this morning, such as motorcycle scrambling, water skiing and other activities, could not be regarded as the management of the land for sport and therefore would be covered by the clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) could give us one example—or preferably two—of precisely what would be covered by the clause. We are in danger of passing and reporting back to the House a clause which will take up space in the statute book and will not do anybody any good. The bulk of the sources of noise that we have spoken about this morning are associated with sport, even if it is the management of the land for sport.

The practice of speedway racing in a so-called quite area of the countryside is relevant in my own constituency, where a planning application is going forward for a speedway track in the village of Chirnside in Berwickshire—and very controversial it is, too. Surely the speedway race and the noise generated by it are as much a part of the management of that land for sport as the ploughing of a field is part of the management of that land for agriculture. This is a legitimate point, and it would be helpful if the hon. Member for South Angus could reply to it. Also I implore him to give an example of what would be covered by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with a preliminary point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)? I wanted to clarify it, but I think that he thought I was seeking to intervene on another point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Motor vehicles would also be included in the provision. If, for example, people decided to race Land Rovers—I believe that this is a sport in some parts of the countryside—up a steep hillside, making an unacceptable level of noise, that would potentially be caught by the provision of it took place in a quite area of the countryside. I want to make that point clear, because the hon. Gentleman seemed to be suggesting that what I had put forward related only to scrambler bikes, Sno-cats and the like. It covers anything that can be described as a vehicle, has an engine and makes a noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. Would it also be fair to say that the lawnmowers which have been mentioned by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollack) are equally vehicles? As far as I know one has to buy a road fund licence to take a lawnmower on the road, if anybody is silly enough to do so. Therefore, presumably they will fall foul of the clause too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether it is necessary to have a vehicle licence for a lawnmower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the speeches made on both sides of the Committee that we shall have to look at the clause again, because problems arise on it. First, in clause 120	<i>(d)</i> we are dealing in the first instance with owners, occupiers or tenants of land,
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the use involved is for management of the land for agriculture, forestry, or sport."</p></blockquote>
What was intended in the paragraph—whether it is accurately reflected in the present drafting may be open to doubt—was that the word "sport" should have the restricted meaning sporting rights in the rural context. The problem may have arisen and the discrepancy between intention and drafting come about because sport, when it is associated with agriculture and forestry, is generally restrictive in its definition. However, in view of the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Garscadden, I accept that there are problems and that it might be necessary to look at the provision again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) that the glider comes out of the examples he gave, because subsection (1) refers to " engine noise". If an aircraft were operated from an airfield and were powered, it would be subject to the ordinary planning laws of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to interrupt, but my hon. Friend must understand that if I own a glider which I use for sport and if I have a large enough field, I can, at present, put a launching winch at the end of the field without applying for planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend did that at present, he would not be restricted by the provision because that is not the engine noise of a vehicle and the glider would not be covered by the byelaws that would be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is very important because the realm of flying machines is so wide and varied. There are now machines called self-launching gliders which are fitted with a Volkswagen engine which is used to get them into the air. I want to make it clear that they are not aeroplanes. There is a difference in definition. They are self-launching gliders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr . Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a number of assumptions. A number of restrictions is involved. First, the measure refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"quiet areas of the countryside".</p></blockquote>
If only one person uses a glider occasionally it is unlikely that a local authority will seek to restrict that activity. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State pointed out, if a local authority were to take such a restrictive view, the matter would have to be considered by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was anxious about those cases where aircraft and helicopters might be involved in the management of the land. The uses of aircraft and helicopters in agriculture are obvious, but the Bill intends to cover sporting rights rather than the wider definition which concerned the hon. Member for Garscadden. Helicopters might be used to take hinds off a hillside, particularly in view of EEC regulations requiring carcasses to be in the deep freeze within 24 hours of being shot. In those circumstances helicopters are more likely to be used than fixed-wing aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend return to the main point of my question? I am worried about the drafting of the clause and want to know where he draws the distinction between sport and the management of the land for sport, even in view of the new definition of sport that he has given. Both aspects are covered at present, but I suspect that he is talking about the use of the land for sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's drafting point. The measure has to be examined from the point of view of what the Bill seeks to achieve rather than what it does achieve as it is drafted. Although it may not be accurately reflected in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
drafting of the Bill, agriculture, forestry, the exercise of sporting rights or the management of the land are intended to be covered. I would be willing to reconsider the subsection to ensure that it reflects the intention of this part of the clause more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden was worried that it was such a blanket exclusion that effectively it left everything out. If his contention is correct, the purpose of the clause is more or less rendered otiose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful interchange. May 1 say to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that I have not given enough attention to the words " management of" and I am grateful that their significance was drawn to my attention. It raises other problems: it is the revolving door principle. For all that, it is useful to understand what is in the hon. Member's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose it is because of my urban background that it had never occurred to me that we were talking in terms of sport—hunting, fishing and shooting. I do not mean that wickedly, because I realise that these have valuable commercial possibilities, and I would never sneer at them. But if it is the traditional grouse moor-type sport—perhaps field sport is a less wicked term—I can see that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South with his rolling acres might want to use a helicopter to spot a pheasant hatchery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to leave the matter now on the basis that the hon. Member for South Angus will think about it. That will give us all a chance to look at new wording before Report and to come back to the matter then. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning that I did not think it necessary to have a clause stand part debate. I make no apologies for saying that I now think that it is necessary. Much has happened in the past hour which has concentrated my mind on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the severest doubts about the usefulness of the clause. I do not think that it is a wicked clause, nor am I suggesting that it is malicious. My doubts about the clause do not mean that I am attacking the need for the Bill. There are many other provisions in it which we shall no doubt want to put on to the statute book and to which we shall want to give a fair wind. But I am not convinced about the need for clause 1 as it is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that because I have a good conservative objection to having on the statute book measures which are not clearly needed and for which there is not a clearly-defined space in the battery of legislative powers open to public-sector organisations, whether they be elected local authorities, or quangos such as the Countryside Commission. I am not convinced that that need has been spelt out here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I accept that there may be occasions when nuisance must be controlled, whether it be vehicles or aircraft making noise in the countryside. I should have thought that in almost all circumstances that could have been done under existing legislation if there was a substantial nuisance. We know that this measure will not strike at aircraft using airfields or airports. The hon. Member was quick to say that there was adequate legislation for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will not cover something which is a regular event, such as the motorcross track. Motor-cross is a good sport. It was practically invented by the BBC because it is possible to put one camera in the middle of the circle and catch everything, and it filled up " Grandstand" very nicely. Whatever its antecedents, motorcross is a growing sport, as is scrambling. However, that would require planning permission. My hon. Friend the Member for Be wick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that that kind of nuisance will be caught by the present planning laws. Therefore we are coming down to the occasional amateur effort in the countryside, where someone decides—not as a regular weekly event—to have some sort of expedition up a hillside to see how far up he can get his Land Rover and causes a great deal of noise in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of accuracy, I point out that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was describing speedway, which has a proper track. Scrambling, as I understand it and as I have experienced it, involves given over an area of a farm for an afternoon to a very noisy set of motor cycles going round in circles. No planning permission is required for that and it would obviously be caught by this measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I take that point. I was about to come to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start from a liberation point of view which I think will be shared by some Conservative Members. This is not a party point. I am speaking for myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that people should be allowed to do what they want to do unless they are impingeing on other people's enjoyment or rights. I think in terms of prima facie. For example, if I want to decide whether I can get my new half-track vehicle up a hill-side, I should be allowed to do that, particularly if I am doing no damage to the land—If I was doing damage, it would raise other issues which would be dealt with in other ways—and if I am not affecting the enjoyment of others. The hon. Gentleman will say that it might affect the enjoyment of others. I am not sure that sterilising tracks of land by bye-laws in this way is justified by the occasional outrage or excess noise of the individual entrepreneur. He is an entrepreneur in terms of creating his own enjoyment. This is using a steam hammer to crack a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, say, in the high peaks of the Cairngorms or in the Lammermuirs there is a case for saying that this is happening so often that the general commonwealth is being harmed and offended and that people's enjoyment of the whole area is being substantially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
impaired, we already have under the countryside legislation a plethora of steps that can be taken by the local authority. First, under section 48 of the 1967 Act, it could declare the area to be a country park. The section says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A country park is a park or pleasure ground in the countryside."</p></blockquote>
The definition is as wide as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the whole point of preserving these areas from unusual noise is because it harms other people's enjoyment of them. If that is true, it might be appropriate to think of access. If there is an access agreement or an access right to the public, there are unlimited powers under section 54 of the 1967 Act to make byelaws. Section 54 says that a local authority may make byelaws that " prohibit, restrict or regulate—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the use of the land, park or waterway, either generally or in any manner specified in the byelaws, by traffic of any description, or for any recreational purpose, so specified".</p></blockquote>
If this kind of threat arises to an area of natural beauty or quiet enjoyment, I should have thought it could be dealt with under section 54. That section covers any area which is owned by the local authority, where a local planning authority had made a country park under section 48, or where
	<br><blockquote><p>"an agreement or order has been made by them for the purpose of giving access to the public or such an order has been prepared in draft".</p></blockquote>
Those powers are very wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that we are to some extent tilting at windmills. In the event that some plethora of small individual activities endangers the enjoyment of an area and because it is small and individual, is not caught by the normal planning laws or under anything else, there are plentiful powers under existing legislation which will allow the Secretary of State or the local authority to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not think that I am being unduly hostile, but I must say that I do not think that the case for this new, widely-conceived power to make byelaws has been justified by what we have heard today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of areas which could be caught are sporting events, outwith the management of field sports in the exemption envisaged, which are better controlled under other forms of legislation or control, and the general activities of the public trying to enjoy an area and inevitably creating a certain amount of noise in doing so. We are adding to the many areas involved the regional parks under clause 5. We know that if the area is of outstanding scenic amenity or importance special powers are being imported under the private arrangement between the Countryside Commission and the Secretary of State for its protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever way we look, we are in danger of creating a jungle of overlapping powers available to local authorities, the Secretary of State, the Countryside Commission and the National Trust for Scotland. I believe that there is a case for simplifying them—not weakening them. I fear that we are putting on the statute book an apparently
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
important power which is not important and merely adds to the general confusion in this area. I must say—I speak purely for myself—that having failed to discover exactly what this Bill will do> and where it will be really useful, I am agin it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read "or sport", I was satisfied that sport and recreation, as I understood them, were covered. I am concerned because flying machines today are of many varied types. We tend to think of aircraft as aeroplanes, but an aircraft is any man-made object that will fly. An aeroplane is different It is a fixed-wing, power-driven, heavier-than-air machine. A glider is a fixed-wing, heavier-than-air aircraft without an engine, until it becomes a self-launching glider. It then becomes a glider, which does not come under the aeroplane regulations because of its weight restrictions. It is below the weight limitations, but it has an engine and it becomes a self-launching glider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the hang glider, which also can have an engine and be powered. It is fairly common practice in my constituency for people to use hang gliders up in Glen Shee and pop off the top of mountains and glide down. Some of these have engines. They are power driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned because airfields are licensed and come under civil aviation laws and regulations. Air strips are not licensed, because they can be any piece of land long enough to cope with a flying machine that can take off and land on that strip of land. Individuals can have airstrips. I am concerned that we should not inhibit the development of such recreation, because it is and has been a substantial growth area for some years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the intent of the Bill. It is a good Bill, but I am concerned that it may produce problems for individuals who are doing their own thing in a quiet part of the country, using an engine fitted to a flying machine which could be caught by such a regulation. I would oppose that because I believe that we must encourage people to get out into the country and make use of it. It is not generally known or acknowledged that the gliding in Scotland is possibly the finest in Europe. Conditions in the Highlands of Scotland allow people in gliders to fly higher than Mount Everest—with or without an engine—purely due to weather phenomena.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to see such sports encouraged and I hope that the clause was not intended to limit participation in such recreation or sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have already drawn attention to the fact that I am one of the sponsors of the Bill. I support the introduction of
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power of district and island councils to control noise in the countryside."</p></blockquote>
That is the description of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become increasingly clear to me during the debate that in real terms the clause, as at present drafted, will not introduce such powers. It is so cluttered with provisos, qualifications and let-outs of one kind or another that it will not be possible for local authorities to introduce effective byelaws which will achieve anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
As I have already said, little will be gained by inserting the clause as at present drafted. Apart fom anything else, it will cost money, and the Minister spends a lot of his time telling us that local authorities should not be spending money in a profligate manner. The legislation could impose duties on local authorities to acquire expensive noise-measuring equipment and to train staff to operate it. If it introduced real powers to control unnecessary noise in the countryside, that would be worth while, but the clause as drafted is so restricted that such expenditure by local authorities could not be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What powers are there in the clause? I have already appealed to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to give us some indication of what would be covered by the clause, but he has not supplied a real reply to that question. We know what the clause does not cover. It does not cover most of the main sources of noise in quiet areas of the countryside. It does not cover model aircraft. That is disappointing news—such a measure could have been useful. It does not cover the Royal Air Force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I gave offence to the hon. Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) by my earlier remarks, but living as I do in my constituency in an area of low-flying, I find it difficult to be sanguine about low-flying aircraft. I well remember the day some years ago when my house was buzzed umpteen times by some military aircraft. I telephoned the police to ask what could be done about it, and they asked me, " Did you get its number? " Although the wretched thing had been just clear of my chimney it had been travelling faster than the speed of sound, and I did not quite see how I was supposed to have got its number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, the clause refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"crown servants acting in the course of their duty".</p></blockquote>
So far as I know, the people who buzz my house so frequently may not be the hon. Gentleman's constituents. They may be flying out of Leuchors, which I understand is in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but they may be foreigners. They may be being trained for foreign air forces. For all I know, the gentleman who buzzed my house as I have described may now be taking advantage of his training over Berwickshire by dropping napalm on peasants in El Salvador.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause only excludes Crown servants. Perhaps therefore it could apply to foreign pilots being trained in this country. If we found out that the aircraft had foreign pilots, it might be possible for district councils to do something about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a very valid point. There is concern about low-flying aircraft. If it is not clear that the Bill does not cover them, people will be under a misapprehension. Low-flying aircraft are one of the nuisances in the countryside. Many of us are prepared to put up with that nuisance in the national interest, but there ought to be a capability of some kind to control it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
The point made by the hon. Gentleman may not have occurred to my hon. Friend when the Bill was being drafted. It is likely that my hon. Friend's reason for the exclusion of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"crown servants acting in the course of their duty"</p></blockquote>
was related to the idea of exercises. As the hon. Gentleman said, joint exercises involving people other than crown servants would not be covered by the inclusion of clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I made a mistake in drawing attention to that loophole, but my aim was to draw attention to some of the immediate sources of noise nuisance in quiet areas of our countryside which are specifically excluded in the terms of the Bill. I referred to military aircraft. I referred to models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another outrageous source of noise in quiet areas must be gunshot. So far as I know, bullets are not counted as vehicles and therefore nothing can be done about them. Sports are excluded and it seems that the exclusion covers the conduct as well as the management of sports, although it will be interesting to see how the courts deal with that point. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) referred to Sno-Cats and helicopters. Even they are excluded, if they are operated by or on behalf of
	<br><blockquote><p>"owners, occupiers or tenants of the land, or owners of an interest in the land,"</p></blockquote>
which is likely to be the case on most occasions when those vehicles are operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the clause excludes noise generated by vehicles involved in
	<br><blockquote><p>"the management of the land for agriculture, forestry or sport."</p></blockquote>
But it does not exclude noise generated by vehicles involved in the management of land for, say, industry or tourism. Could it be that an industry, perhaps a distillery—I see the hon. Member for Banfff (Mr. Myles) looking nervous—in a remote area of Speyside where vehicles make a certain amount of noise although a legitimate industry in a rural area, could be challenged, under the provisions of the Bill if some malicious person were to complain about the noise made by vehicles delivering supplies of grain and so on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are putting in such provisios, perhaps we should cover legitimate industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Myles	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the local authority would decide whether to introduce the byelaw to control the noise and, judging by the rates that a local authority receives from a distillery, I should not think it would do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not worried about the local authorities in this instance, but presumably if the hon. Member for South Angus wants to put the clause on the statute book and to enable local authorities to introduce byelaws, he must envisage a situation where local authorities might decide to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, after byelaws under the terms of the Bill had been brought into effect, somebody were to bring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
a prosecution under the byelaws, he could be challenging the right of such people as the distillers in the hon. Member's constituency to operate vehicles in the course of their business. That would be a worrying development and would put jobs at risk in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member includes provisos he ought to cover legitimate industries, tourism and similar occupations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it worth raising those points on the clause stand part debate. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden that the clause as at present drafted is so full of loopholes that it is not worth enacting at all. While I would support genuine measures to control unnecessary and injurious noise in the countryside, I am not satisfied that the clause as at present drafted would achieve that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often happens on these occasions the Committee approaches a clause of this kind with the best of good wishes and good will and then works itself into a lather of criticism—usually in midstream, while Members are on their feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the clause still has considerable merit and for that reason I welcome it. However, I should like to clarify with my hon. Friend a few points of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (2)(a) we had very little discussion of what are
	<br><blockquote><p>"crown servants acting in the course of their duty".</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend envisage something like a cadre of bowler-hatted civil servants in pin stripes ploughing up the Union canal in a power boat, or has he some other pressing example in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to make a similarity irreverent comment about " statutory undertakers". I presume that those are persons fulfilling duties imposed upon them by statute, but I should welcome clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the " emergency services " the intention is obvious, but, seriously, will my hon. Friend confirm that the Bill will not preclude reference to voluntary emergency services? In country areas, including my constituency, there are highly developed and worthwhile voluntary emergency services which should not be impeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part of the clause which has caused most discussion is subsection (2)(d). I was interested in some amendments which were not selected. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), with a remarkable disinterest, sought to delete the word " owners" from that exemption. I should certainly have opposed that and I think that it is astonishing that the hon. Gentleman sought to delete it. However, he has not had the opportunity to move his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That amendment, which we cannot debate, would have left the occupiers and tenants of land, who are the people who have a legitimate interest in working and managing the

In the definition of the Act, I imagine that a windsurfer is not a boat because it does not have an engine. Windsurfing is done standing up on a platform propelled by wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting example and it worries me a little. I do not know Loch Ken as well as the hon. Gentleman, but I have friends who live in Crossmichael, at the foot of Loch Ken, and I drive past it frequently. Does the hon. Gentleman envisage the provision being used to turn Loch Ken into a quiet area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that quietness is important—I am not against quiet areas—but Loch Ken is a very busy tourist attraction. It has a highly-developed complex of caravan and camping sites and hotels. It is one of the busiest lochs I know. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that a responsible local authority would think of making byelaws to restrict legitimate tourist activities on Loch Ken, that would be a dangerous use of the power and one which the hon. Gentleman should consider again if he intends to bring it forward as the shining example of what could be done by this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I qualified my remarks by saying that I did not know the legal position. However, it is a classic case of an attractive piece of countryside which is subject to intrusion by large numbers of people to practise a wide range of sports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the bank of Loch Ken has recently been turned into a bird sanctuary with the approval of the RSPB. Inevitably, these sports conflict with each other. The development of power boating, particularly at the southern end of the loch, is a hazard to which the district council might wish to turn its attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, the stone supports of an old railway bridge create a blind corner for emerging water skiers. I have had correspondence with constituents about that problem and it might be a case in point.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Perhaps my hon. Friend will give his views on that when he winds up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the subsection and its importance in the clause, the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian raised the question of industry. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Myles) pointed out, the triggering off of the measure would be by the district council which has a strong vested interested in not impeding industry in its natural and proper development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wonder whether the words " agriculture, forestry, or sport" should not be expanded. I note that my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus has undertaken to reconsider the wording of this subsection before Report. In particular, I wonder whether horticulture should not deserve special mention. Perhaps that is adequately covered by agriculture, but, more significantly, perhaps fish farming is not covered by agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fish fanning is trying hard to become an automatically included part of agriculture and has recently won a battle over derating. It is a particularly important industry in my own constituency and in other parts of Scotland. If we specify agriculture, we probably ought to bracket fish farming with it unless we can satisfy ourselves that that is already adequately covered by agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to say something about tourism, which the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian also mentioned. I think that there would probably be a case for including tourism in the provisions of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it has become apparent as the debate has progressed that several members of the Committee see themselves as statutory undertakers who are anxious to bury this clause. But, for all the anxieties expressed about the precision of the drafting, there are sufficient good provisions in the clause for us to approve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that some doubts persist about whether to cover model aircraft, and I think that the Bill's sponsor is aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful for his clarification that the definition of " sport" is intended to cover sporting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Distilleries have been mentioned. In my constituency, quarrying is carried out on a substantial scale. I assume that the Bill does not intend to strike at activities. such as blasting operations, and perhaps that area of activity might be examined when drafting the exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the speeches have had a certain autobiographical flavour and I would like to make a brief autobiographical point to illustrate the benefit that the Bill might achieve. Last Sunday I took my young family for a walk on a beach at Roseisle on the Moray Firth. The beach lies about 2½miles away from the RAF base at Kinloss, from where Nimrod aircraft regularly take off on their sorties. Those are fairly noisy aircraft, but that nuisance—if it can be so called—is understood and accepted by the local population. The RAF tries to keep the noise to a minimum, especially at weekends. Therefore, I was somewhat annoyed when my family arrived on the beach, and a very noisy motor cycle
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
came at us from about 300 or 400 yards away. That caused considerable displeasure both for me and, I suspect, for others who had gone for a quiet family stroll on a Sunday afternoon. I hope that the Bill intends to remove such activities from those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all accept that problems can arise, but we are unsure whether this is the right way of dealing with them. I used the cliche of wondering whether we were using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The hon. Gentleman has expertise in the area, and I wonder how he would control that problem. Presumably, we are thinking of a defined area of several square miles or square hectares and of a prohibition which would attract penal sanctions. I did not mention that in my clause stand part speech, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give us some idea of the structure of the byelaws and the enforcement machinery that he envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting query. How are noisy motor cyclists—either alone or in groups—to be stopped or controlled from rambling across a beach? Perhaps we should consider the machinery of enforcement at greater length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) also mentioned earlier the area of prohibition. It is comparatively simple to put up a notice indicating that the byelaw is in operation where there is a reasonably well defined beach area with access at only one end. But in a huge land mass such as the Cairngorms or the Grampian mountains one does not want to end up with a proliferation of signs every few hundred yards. They, would buy the silence for which one craves at the expense of the spoliation of the natural habitat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to butt in, but it is an important matter that we have not touched on. It is as well to do it by intervention and then the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) can deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are assuming a quiet area of countryside, we are probably not talking about a tightly-defined, single beach, which I suspect could be dealt with under other legislation. What we are trying to strike at is the young man from Glasgow, with his best girl on the pillion, who sets out with a couple of his peer group on 500 cc motor cycles into the countryside. It is very difficult for them to know when they are going into the quiet area of countryside. It is very difficult to police it in the case of a casual, one-off intruder and to give people warning that they are moving into an area where there will be penal sanctions if they progress any further. If it is a nice tidy beach there will be a car park at one end where one can park a motor cycle and a large notice saying that, under the byelaws, one cannot go on to the beach with one's motor cycle, buggy-cart or whatever it may be. However, if it is, as the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) suggested, an area of the Cairngorms, there are genuine difficulties of enforcement and of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
making people aware that a vehicle which is perfectly legitimate when driven along the road or through an adjoining area of the countryside suddenly becomes illegal. This is something to which we perhaps ought to turn our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the burden of that intervention was directed kindly at my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to deal with in his reply. Therefore, I shall not respond at length, except to say that I would not belittle the kind of example that I gave earlier of the solitary cyclist. It may be very difficult to police such an operation. Perhaps in the north-east we do not have the neatness of beach such as that at Troon, where one arrives at the town and is directed to the car park, which is at one end of the beach where it is very easy to put a sign or warning. Other parts of the countryside are not necessarily similar to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other example that comes to my mind to show how the clause could be doing good is if the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) were in his constituency during a good spell of summer weather and he and his wife chose to sunbathe on the beach. Presumably if enthusiasts chose to take their aircraft over there, there would be nothing at present to stop them in effect buzzing the right hon. Member. However, under the provisions of the Bill, the islands council could pass the appropriate order, which I should have thought it would be possible to intimate in a convenient way so as to discourage that kind of activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but there are all sorts of regulations under which buzzing is controlled. If the hon. Member is advancing that as a justification for the clause, it is ludicrous that someone sunbathing in a quiet area should have that protection while someone bathing in a busy beach area should not. It may be worse on a busy beach to have low-flying " buzzing", as the hon. Member described it. I think that it is a very thin piece of reed to clutch at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the experience of aircraft and related matters which the hon. Member for Garscadden clearly has, It is very refreshing to find a real expert on the Opposition side in correlation with our own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that I have said enough to make it clear that I believe that the intention is worthy. There is enough to be salvaged to make it worth while to persist with clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am amazed at the ingenuity of some hon. Members in this debate. I am staggered that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) managed to drag El Salvador into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). As I understood it, his first anxiety about the clause was simply whether it was worth while: did it achieve anything or, alternatively, was it a sledgehammer to crack what is, relatively, a small nut?
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I firmly believe that the clause has a value here. With respect, some of the alternative remedies that he suggested do- not seem to be serious options that would be open to a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister holding my hand during these proceedings had been my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland rather than my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, we might have been provided with what may be the clearest example of what is required in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a number of years, the development of water skiing has been taking place in Loch Earn. The loch is well used in that way. Because of the pressure on that loch and the number of people using it already, there is a movement into the other inland lochs in Perthshire and, in particular, Loch Tay. Loch Tay is a long loch. It is 16 or 18 miles long. At the Kenmore end of the loch there is an established and growing water ski club. I think it is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). The members of the club are water skiing there at the moment and it is accepted that they need to have access to water and should be allowed to pursue their sport. No one would restrict that. But I suggest that there is a compelling need that they should not use the whole 16 or 18 miles of the loch. At weekends a constant buzz is building up around the loch, from the Kenmore end to Killin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has had numerous complaints about the noise. As that is a quiet area of the countryside, part of the loch should be designated under such byelaws as being free from the use of noisy motor boats. One would then be allowing both forms of enjoyment. One end of the loch could be noisy and the other could be enjoyed in peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give another example. In the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire there are the valuable recreation and tourist activities of Glen Shee. In the immediate vicinity of that skiing establishment, Sno-Cats are used. They are used for the management of the pistes and—quite properly—for the rescue of anyone who may have injured an ankle, for example, or broken a leg. But there is a potential threat, and it is one that would concern my constituency. The Sno-Cats might move out of the immediate area of the ski slopes. People might use them along the ridge and all the way into the Angus glens. I would have thought that that would be legitimate cause for complaint. The area is used by longdistance skiers and walkers, and I suggest that they are entitled to enjoy those sports away from the noise, although clearly it would be open to the local authority not in any way to intrude on what is going on at Glen Shee itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with what the hon. Gentleman said about section 48, country parks access orders and access agreements. So far as byelaws are concerned, apart from the expense of the necessary procedure, there would be no expenditure. But—we may have to develop this point on clause 5—the use of a country park is not really an appropriate device for dealing with problems on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Grampian mass. The use of access agreements or access orders certainly involved some expenditure, and, in any case, although there may well be circumstances in which one would wish to encourage the use of access agreements and management agreements, I question whether they would be an appropriate means of dealing with the specific problem of noise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) raised a number of points about Crown servants and statutory undertakers. I think that the term " Crown servant " covers anyone and everyone in the service of the Crown, and I think it is clear what bodies the term " statutory undertakers " includes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean the undertakers of statutory functions. My hon. Friend made a good point about the emergency services. Certainly in a number of emergency service arrangements there is a considerable voluntary clement, I have already referred to Glen Shee and the mountains. The mountain rescue service is largely staffed on a voluntary basis, and it would be unreasonable to seek to restrict that activity in any way. As I said previously, the use of a Sno-Cat to bring down someone injured on a mountain would be highly appropriate. No attempt would be made to restrict an activity of that type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway related to fish farming and horticulture. Looking again at clause 	<i>2(d)</i> we shall bear in mind what he had to say about both fish farming and horticulture. If it is considered that these are not already included, something will be done to ensure that they are covered. Again, it is clearly our intention that those activities should be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) asked about quarrying, but the noise that concerns him would be the blasting noise. That is not an engine noise. I should have thought that any noise problems caused by quarrying are problems that would be dealt with when planning permission was given to quarry. I understand his anxieties, but the problem would not be restricted by these byelaws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that my hon. Friend raised of motor cycles on beaches is a point worth taking. Seeing the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) reminds me of another anticipated anxiety, that on some of the splendid beaches in his constituency people might use scrambler bikes in large measure, or might start to use light aircraft. I do not think that the problem has arisen yet to .any extent, but if it were to in the Western Isles there is at present no powers to control the noise. Curiously, if the problem were of speedboats or pleasure boats in the water there are powers to control them under section 56 of Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 to which I referred the hon. Member for Garscadden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) I wish to emphasise
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
that there is no intention to restrict the legimate recreational flying activities. All that would be restricted is landing and taking off in certain areas, and those would be within a restricted ambit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Garscadden asked about enforcement, which arose out of the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn. Possibly one of the reasons why we have not addressed our minds to enforcement this morning is that we have not yet looked at subsection 1(3). The hon. Gentleman will see that that subsection allows for the introduction of rangers for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the enforcement of such byelaws would be achieved in three ways. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that one does not want signposts all over the Cairngorms, but there are pretty obvious access points, such as the one on the ski road into Cairngorm itself. I suggest that it would be reasonable to put a few notices there explaining the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second line of control and enforcement would be through the rangers who would—potentially at least—be operating under the Bill, so an additional mechanism is built in here. Thirdly, there are the usual enforcement measures, which may include penal sanctions, arising under all byelaws. I take the hon. Gentleman's general point that byelaws sometimes are difficult to enforce, because even in the public parks in the cities of this country it is sometimes difficult to know precisely what byelaws are in force. Even if one does find the notice it is so lengthy and elaborate that possibly lawyers like the hon. Gentleman understand them, but other people may not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that those problems are attendant on all byelaws, but I do not find it appropriate to say that because, in the last resort, byelaws have to be set out in a proper legal form, that is a reason for saying that there is no point in having the byelaws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a drafting point if my hon. Friend is reconsidering the clause. Clause l(3)(b) refers to the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1980, which I presume is the Bill that we are dealing with at the moment. But the Bill is to be cited as the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1981 according to the interpretation clause at the end of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his eagle eyes. I rather hoped that no one else would notice it, but it is a point well taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having referred to the problem at Glen Shee, to the problem which could exist somewhere like the Western Isles, to what might happen in places such as Loch Tay and indeed to the apposite example given by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), I hope that hdh. Members appreciate that the clause has a value. We are not suggesting that the power is draconian or so major that it will wholly transform and eliminate the problems of noise in the countryside. But, in addition to the powers that exist under planning permission and to those that would exist if we were to set up country parks and the like, it is worth giving this additional power to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
local authorities in limited circumstances, so that they can take advantage of what is given to them in the clause. For that reason I invite hon. Members to leave the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I contemplated this morning's proceedings, I felt a little guilty about forcing a debate by tabling amendments, because I recognised that there was a fair amount of good will for the concepts in the Bill. But I do not feel guilty at the end of the debate, because it has been interesting; nor do I make an apology for saying that I did a lot of thinking on my feet, in the sense that, as the debate unfolded, my attitudes changed somewhat and changed back again at various points. It is perhaps one of the good things about Private Member's legislation that we have that luxury, and we all ought to exercise it on occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also greatly enjoyed the excellent exercise in peer-group loyalty that we have seen this morning, as various hon. Members who normally have almost an allergy to byelaws and local authority powers turned themselves into the Seventh Cavalry and came if not galloping enthusiastically, at least trotting over the rise to the aid of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain sceptical about how useful the clause will be. As I say, it does not easily fit into an obvious gap. However, I have listened with some sympathy to what the hon. Member for South Angus has said. I think that it will be difficult to police byelaws. Even if there is a notice, and even if the mythical motor cyclist understands that he is in breach of a byelaw, it may be very difficult to make a citizen's arrest as he goes past at 60 miles an hour. It is unlikely that the local constabulary will be placed upon a lonely beach somewhere in the Western Isles in expectation of such a breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last report of the Countryside Commission, which is now over a year old, revealed that there were 83 countryside rangers. I imagine that they would tend to be concentrated on access routes in the country parks and in areas with a higher statutory profile than quiet areas of the countryside, which are not covered by the rangers and therefore have had to be the subject of this type of byelaw. Therefore, I must confess that I am not sanguine about the effective policing of any order that may be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, having expressed my reservations, I realise that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider some of the wording. I made it clear that I did not think that there was anything malicious in the intent behind the clause. Indeed, I thought that the terse and economic phrasing of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) was something that I should adopt. He said—I think that I quote him accurately—that the intention was "worthy" and that it was possible that there was enough in the Bill to salvage something from the clause. That is not exactly a hearty endorsement. I doubt whether support for this measure will feature prominently in his next election address, but he may have got the balance just about right. Therefore, although I remain an agnostic on the matter, I do not intend
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
to divide the Committee. I hope that the clause will be improved by the time it reaches Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that these are non-contra-versial amendments and I hope that they will be looked at sympathetically. They may not be exactly right, but the spirit is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with amendment No. 5. Clause 2 adds the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
My objection to that is twofold. First, I do not think that the phrase is necessary. The new subsection (11) of section 13 of the 1967 Act would read perfectly well without these words. It would read
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments made under subsection (2) above shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the capital value of the land arrived at in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
I am not clear as to why we need
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement".</p></blockquote>
This is a small point, but it is not merely a case of words that I suspect may be redundant, because if we look at section 13(2) of the 1967 Act, a careless reader—and I admit to having been a careless reader initially—might be confused because subsection (2) states
	<br><blockquote><p> An access agreement may provide for the making of payments by the local planning authority of either or both of the following descriptions, that is to say in consideration of the making of the agreement and by way of defraying or contributing towards expenditure incurred by the person making the agreement in consequence thereof."</p></blockquote>
When I first looked at the new subsection (11), I thought that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
referred only to the first of the possible basis of payment under the statute—in other words, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
did not include
	<br><blockquote><p>"and by way of defraying or contributing towards expenditure incurred by the person making the agreement in consequence thereof."</p></blockquote>
I agree that if one reads on and studies what it says, it becomes clear that that is not the right interpretation, but the initial thought on reading it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
that the making of the agreement refers to the first of the two reasons for payment contained in section 13(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member sees what I am driving at. It is because I believe that the words may. lead to such a misunderstanding and are somewhat ambiguous and are not necessary to the sense of the new subsection (11), that I seriously suggest that there is a case for omitting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8, which deal with the schedule which is being added to the 1967 Act. I do not object to the schedule. I think that it is important that we should have a means of calculating the consideration or the meeting of expenses of die making of the agreement and the consequent expenses—which presumably means how the maintenance of the pathways, gates and bridges should be calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My heart fell when I read schedule 4. These sums of money will be small, I suspect, and will be matters of agreement. Rather a blunderbuss of a schedule is being added with complicated matters involving the Secretary of State, the fixing of maximum figures and the further negotiation of percentages below the maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the amendments is to take out the Secretary of State's fixing of the maximum figure, merely leaving it for negotiation as to the proper proportion of the figure set by the district valuer. The effect seems to be the same. It is much neater and much simpler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I do not want to interrupt him in any argument upon which he may wish to elaborate, but it may be helpful if I tell him at this stage that I consider that there is considerable merit in amendment No. 6, which would remove clause 3(2) and this step of fixing a percentage figure by the Secretary of State. The other amendments that he proposes on clause 3 are essentially consequent upon that one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know whether he will accept the amendment, but I hope that he understands my point. The amendment is based upon the unfortunate phrase used in new subsection (11):
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement".</p></blockquote>
Those words echo "in consideration of the making of the agreement" as only one part of the possible grounds for payment. Ambiguity and misunderstanding may arise there, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also look at that amendment sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may comment on amendment No. 6. My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has indicated that he finds it acceptable and I do not dissent from him in that observation. Perhaps I may say this in order to clarify what would happen if the Committee agrees to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) correcdy pointed out that the method proposed in clause 3(2) is rather unnecessary and complex to meet what might be the public interest in the grand total that was paid to a person in respect of clause 3. As the hon. Gentleman anticipated, under clause 11 the sums which a local authority may pay to someone for this purpose would be likely to be recovered from the Countryside Commission, which can make grants for this purpose. In the normal way in which the Secretary of State has the ultimate responsibility for how the Countryside Commission operates, some guidelines would have to be laid down to ensure that the aggregate sum paid to someone was a reasonable amount. As the Secretary of State pays for this service, it is right that guidelines of which the local authoirty is aware should be laid down, which could be taken into account when the sum was being calculated. This would be a more flexible, common-sense approach to dealing with this general problem instead of the somewhat mechanistic way originally proposed in the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's intervention, there is no need for me to elaborate upon the reasons why I should be prepared to see paragraph (2) omitted from the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little worried when I read through the schedule and got down to paragraph (3), even with what we now agree is a more flexible and sensible way of approaching the matter. Paragraph (3) states that the figure
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be paid by the planning authority in respect of each twelve month period."</p></blockquote>
I could not find the trigger reference to the " twelve month period". It looks like a consequential reference to a 12 month period and I could find no reference in the original statute to the effect that it will be paid on that 12-monthly basis</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in paragraph (1) (b) of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not help me. Paragraph (l)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the use of the land is that which applied or which will apply on the first day of the twelve month period to which the consideration will relate."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an annual payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an annual payment that is paid ad infinitum as long as the access agreement is in force. Once we have set the 12-month cost consequential on that access agreement, it is then paid every 12 months until there is no longer an access

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
agreement in force. Is there any provision for inflation updating? Is it like a lease where, after five years, there is a break for renegotiation, or is it totally static? For example, does it involve maintenance of gates, the wayleave of the path, bridging, and so on? As the access agreement is semi-permanent, can we get the machinery clear? Is there a way in which there will be an updating, or the possibility of an updating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is as the hon. Gentleman has understood it. He has already had explained to him that under paragraph 	<i>1(b)</i> of new schedule 4 what is intended is an annual payment. If it was simply a matter of acquisition of the capital value of the land and nothing else, there is already, both as a matter of agreement or compul-sorily, an opportunity for the local authority to acquire full ownership of the land in question. All that the clause seeks to do is to set up the mechanism whereby a local authority can secure an access agreement without having to go to the cost of acquiring it as a capital asset. The local authority would then pay for it on an annual basis. It was intended that subsection (2) would provide a mechanism for the calculation of what should be the limit of that annual payment. However, as the Minister has explained, it is possible to do that administratively through the Secretary of State and the Country side Commission without the necessity of any statutory arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to amendment No. 5. I hope that I shall not be going too wide if I go back to what the problem has been and why there is a necessity for an amendment to section 13 of the 1967 Act. That section provides for the making of access agreements and although it includes the provision for a discretionary payment to someone with whom an access agreement is made, it does not provide any method for computing that payment. At present, the amount that can be paid is determined by the poor district valuer attempting to assess the value of the benefit of that access to the public. District valuers have no market against which they can attempt to test the value they are assessing for this access right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, in such areas as Torridon, in National Trust property, on Ben Lawers and, I believe, also in Glencce, when the district valuer was asked to try to assess the value, he was stumped and he could work only to a nominal value for that access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure seeks to give the district valuer and both parties to the agreement an opportunity to attempt to make an assessment. The amendment to section 13 would make it necessary first to arrive at the basis of the assessment of the capital value of the land over which the access agreement is to be .operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that where the hon. Member may have misunderstood matters is that that is only one way of doing it. In addition to the capital value, there may also be readily identifiable expenses, both in
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
legal terms in the making of the access agreement, or expenses on the ground such as the provision of a fence, gate, or stile. As I understand it, if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were accepted, even if there were identifiable expenses which could be vouched for, the only way to assess the amount payable to the person making the access agreement would be to look to the rather abstract formulation—for these purposes—of the capital value of the land. All that we seek to do here is to say that first, one looks to capital value. Once that has been assessed capital value, which is for the consideration of making the agreement, one then sets in motion the schedule as varied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, or additionally, one can also discover from that party what expenses it has incurred in the legal costs of making the agreement or whether there are any physical costs involved in providing a gate, and one calculates on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it would be nonsense, when one has those figures, to attempt to assess the amount payable on the basis of the capital value, I would futher suggest that what the hon. Gentleman seeks to do is essentially misguided because I cannot believe that he would like to make the calculation of payment artificial when the amount payable to the person making the agreement can be identified. That would introduce an unnecessary element of artificiality as there is now a proper basis of calu-lation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I may be being obtuse, but I do> not understand that point. If that were the effect of my proposal, I would understand that it was unfortunate and I would not want to carry it out. The hon. Gentleman was referring to amendment No. 5, which seeks to amend clause 2 to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments made under subsection (2) above shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the capital value."</p></blockquote>
At present it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments made under subsection (2) above in consideration of the making of the agreement".</p></blockquote>
Am I right in assuming that the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
are a qualification which refers to only the first of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"following descriptions, that is to say in consideration of the making of the agreement",</p></blockquote>
or do they also include " by way of defraying "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is the whole point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not include that; I see. The new method of calculation in schedule 4 is, therefore, only available to the expenses of making the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person can show the expenses that he has incurred, it is right that he should get those back to the last penny. We are not talking about the expenses incurred, but about a payment in consideration of the making of an agreement. In a sense that is a symbolic payment representing the fact that the owner of the land is giving right of access to the general public. Therefore, it is appropriate that he should receive a payment in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
compensation for being unable to use his land as he may otherwise have wished to do. That sum cannot be specifically calculated. It is not one which he has paid out. It is, therefore, right that the capital value should be used as the best way of judging what the consideration is worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now see. I hope that I am not being obtuse, but it is quite complicated. I want to be sure that I have not misunderstood. If there are legal expenses for the making of the agreement and subsequently, because of the patter of many thousand urban feet, it is necessary to remake footbridges and so on, thus giving rise to charges consequential upon that agreement, those charges can be reimbursed in full.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As such. That method of calcu lation or capital assessment is what might be called a price—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—a price being paid for the right of access. I am happy to withdraw the amendment and give the hon. Gentleman time to think about the matter, but I think that that point ought to be made far clearer because I have made very heavy weather of it and think that others may do so too. I assumed that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments made under subsection (2) above in consideration of the making of the agreement",</p></blockquote>
referred to all subsection (2) payments. I think that that is a possible source of confusion. That was compounded by the fact that there is a specific reference to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"consideration of the making of the agreement".</p></blockquote>
which, as I now understand it, is not now included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman re-reads section 13(2), he will see that it specifically says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may provide for the making of payments by the local planning authority of either or both of the following descriptions".</p></blockquote>
Two quite distinct categories are provided for and given that my hon. Friend's clause, in its present form, refers to only one of those categories, it seems perfectly clear that that is the one to which schedule 4 refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now see what the position is and am happy that it is as it should be. I am not sure that the position is clearly explained by the statutory words. Perhaps the fault is in the 1967 Act, for when I raised the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement " and by way of defraying consequentials, if I may put it in that way, I took " the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
to be the actual legal costs of making the agreement, and the consequentials to be what happened after it had been made. I now understand that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consideration of the making of the agreement"</p></blockquote>
refers to the moral cost of agreeing to let people on to one's land, and that there is a third category, the legal expenses, which are not referred to in statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Let me leave it, Mr. Lamond, that I shall seek to withdraw amendment No. 5. Perhaps someone, with skilled help, should look at the various forms of wording to make the meaning clear. A simple amendment to the 1967 Act might help to unravel it. I am happy to leave people to think about the matter and, if they came up with a better solution, I should be grateful to be saved the mental twists in which I found myself when I first came across that form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the amendments that are acceptable—I am grateful that they are acceptable—I do not wish to sound ungracious about my own amendments, but I hope that the Minister will say a little more about his relations with the Countryside Commission and about the guidelines that he may set down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the simplification, which I still, on balance approve, we lose the right to annul by resolution of either House of Parliament. If the Minister says that the price that could be paid as a percentage of the capital value—say, 2 per cent; of the capital value—could not be challenged or even, possibly, known, that seems to be a slight compensating offset to the greater simplicity and the more sensible general approach that the amendments provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which is to be accepted, it would be for the local authority to show the proportion of the figure, in terms of new schedule 4(3), that should be given to the owner of the land. In suggesting that proportion, the local authority will clearly be in consultation with the Countryside Commission because the commission will be paying the money. As the Countryside Commission comes under the Secretary of State, it will be necessary to think of it in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to get the matter wrapped up before 1 o'clock. Can the Minister help me further? When the innocent abroad—and, on this matter, I certainly fall into that category—reads this, he will assume that compensation will be paid by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not pick up any reference to the fact that the compensation would come from the Countryside Commission. That, therefore, was a complication that I had not seen. When I drafted the amendments I wondered why the Secretary of State needed to be involved in the matter. It was an arm's-length transaction, with the aid of a district valuer's valuation, between the local authority and the owner of the land. I had not understood that the payment—is it 100 per cent, reimbursement?—would be made by the Countryside Commission. Perhaps we need a little more information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A local authority does not have to insist on getting the money back from the Countryside Commission. The commission has discretion on whether it pays. But, in normal circumstances, a payment made by a local authority in respect of such an agreement would be reimbursed by the Countryside Commission under clause 11. At present, it is done by the Secretary of State, who uses the commission as an agent, but in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
future it can be done directly by the commission if clause 11 is approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So it is really an administrative arrangement. There is no statutory authority; it is just an administrative convenience. That is a complication that I had not appreciated when I first read the Bill. I thought that no other bodies were involved apart from the local authority, the owner of the land and, because of subsection (2), the Secretary of State imported. I intended to deport the Secretary of State. I mean that in the nicest possible way. But he clings tenaciously, for he comes in as the backer of the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried because we shall not now know what instructions are given to the Countryside Commission. Could the Minister briefly say whether there is a way in which the decision could be made known? I assume that it is not a. one-off matter—in other words, the percentage under the order, if that machinery had survived, would have been a set percentage for all transactions. Shall we then have a circular or guidance as to the Secretary of State's intentions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that he is seeking flexibility. That would not have been present in the original wording of the Bill but it will be present in future. Therefore, it is not a question of having a fixed, rigid policy. It will be possible to look at the merits of an individual application and judge what is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Countryside Commission would then pay on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a discretionary basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, guided by the Secretary of State. If, on the other hand, the local authority made a bargain that 20 per cent, of the capital value would be the compensation, but the guide lines said only 10 per cent., there would be nothing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
