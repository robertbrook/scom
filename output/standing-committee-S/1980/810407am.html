<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. In column 586 of the <i>Official Report</i> of Thursday afternoon's sitting it is recorded that the Chairman made a lengthy speech on some amendments. You were not in the Chair then, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that it was not the Chairman who made that lengthy speech. I hope that the <i>Official Report</i> will be amended accordingly, and that my hon Friend's name will be inserted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand the hon Member to say that the speech should be in his name?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Gourlay. It should be in the name of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The authorities will take due note of the hon Member's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O"Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mr. Gourlay. There is a mistake this morning in relation to the late amendments, which are given as being in my name and the names of some of my hon Friends and my right hon Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Concannon). The name should be that of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). The mistake was probably caused by my writing. Had the Clerk been present, I expect the mistake would have been picked up. The amendments concerned are Nos. 219, 220 and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that we have great difficulty, in these modern times, in being accurate. I hope that when these matters have been drawn to the attention of those responsible, the mistakes will not occur in future. Let us now turn our attention to schedule 4.</span></p>

REVOCATION OF DETERMINATIONS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 204, in page 55, line 12, leave out "three years" and insert "one year".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 205, in page 55, line 17, leave out "three years" and insert "one year".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments have the same purpose, and I am pleased to see, Mr. Gourlay, that you have grouped them. If the amendments were made, the revocation of a determination for the purposes of the assisted places scheme could take place after only one year's notice.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
We take the view that the scheme should be brought to an end as soon after the next general election as possible. The Labour Party finds the assisted places scheme totally unacceptable, and we have made it clear that we will seek to dismantle it at the first opportunity.<br><br>
We recognise that the programme of legislation of a future Government may well entail a fair amount of business, and we cannot, of course, undertake that on the Friday morning after the next general election Labour will stop the assisted places scheme, but we would hope to refer to that part of our programme in the Queen's Speech, and then to get the legislation through as quickly as possible.<br><br>
The present Government—whom by the next general election we hope we shall be able to call the last Government—had a legislative year of 17 to 18 months, from May 1979 to October 1980. We felt it appropriate to have an amendment to change the determination to one year's notice on either side.<br><br>
We recognise that one year's notice by the Secretary of State applies to amendment No. 205, whereas amendment No. 204 applies to the right of proprietors or managers of a participating school to
<br><blockquote><p>"request the Secretary of State to revoke the determination by giving him one year's written notice or such shorter notice as he may in any particular case accept."</p></blockquote>
We recognise that a "particular case" might be the burning down of a school or a contraction in the accommodation, for whatever reason—an old building such as is used by many of the private schools for accommodation might be subject to an order by the local authority condemning it as unfit for human habitation. We recognise that this would not be a common occurrence. We accept that the latter part of the clause would cover emergencies, but on the simple closure of the scheme the private schools might find that if they did not use some form of academic selection the quality of the pupils in their view was not high enough to merit the continuation of the scheme for any length of time, which could result in an attempt to revoke on these grounds.<br><br>
The cases for revocation are many and varied, but we aim to end the scheme as quickly as possible. In the absence of legislation, because we know that legislation cannot always go through as quickly as one would like—or as slowly as we would like in the case of this legislation—the Opposition hope that as soon as a Labour Secretary of State for Scotland is appointed after the next general election he will make clear his decision to revoke the determination within the 12-month period.<br><br>
The two amendments, therefore, hang together, because if there is to be a period of notice for one side, it should be the same for the other. We have therefore included both the managers of the participating school and the Secretary of State in the same category. We recognise that Conservative Members may regard this as a wrecking amendment, but that is not our intention. We are simply setting down a realistic time scale under which Parliament could operate, so that all those participating in the scheme—both managers and pupils—will be clear as to their rights if a Labour Government are returned at the next general election committed to the dismantling of the scheme.<br><br>
The passing of the amendment would in effect be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
the first step towards the ending of the scheme. We recognise that we may not have the support of many Government Members, but we shall press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The time scales in schedule 4 are there because we believe that it is reasonable that a fairly long period of notice should normally be given before a school is withdrawn from the assisted places scheme. We believe that schools ought not to enter the scheme unless they have a firm intention to remain in it and make a success of it. Equally, we believe that the Secretary of State ought not to admit a school to the scheme, and will not do so, unless he is satisfied that it has those intentions and the ability to carry them out. The normal three-year period gives expression to the serious character of participation.<br><br>
There is, as the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) recognised, provision in the schedule for quicker action where good reason exists. Paragraph 1 enables the Secretary of State to accept shorter notice in a particular case. Paragraph 4 enables him to revoke a determination at any time if he is not satisfied that the school's educational standards are being maintained at an appropriate level, or is satisfied that it is failing in its duties under the scheme generally.<br><br>
We believe that those are proper reasons for the insertion of the time scales. They relate entirely to the administration of the assisted places scheme, rather than take into account the hon Member's political considerations. It is our purpose to introduce a scheme which is practical and which will be administered with the least amount of fuss, and in the best interests of the two parties to the scheme—the parents and children on one side and the schools on the other.<br><br>
The only serious, or half-serious, point made by the hon Gentleman was that the provision would simplify the means of the next Labour Government—if there is such a thing—of abolishing the scheme. That is not our intention in presenting the scheme or in drafting the Bill. We want the scheme to work well, and we do not want to facilitate the wild political fantasies of the Labour Party. For that reason, I ask my hon Friends to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply to my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) on amendments Nos. 204 and 205 is totally unsatisfactory.<br><br>
Amendment No. 204 refers to the notice required if the proprietors or managers of the participating school wish to terminate its participation in the assisted places scheme. My hope is that at least some schools—if this crazy scheme ever gets off the ground—will eventually see the light and want to turn themselves into comprehensive schools able to cater for the needs of a larger cross-section of school children.<br><br>
At the head of some of these schools there may be enlightened people who will eventually see the strong educational arguments put by the Opposition and by many people throughout Scotland that the scheme is inherently bad. They may, therefore, after being allowed to participate by the Secretary of State, and in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
maturity of time, say that they want nothing to do with the scheme. There may even be a school which decides that its best future lies in full integration into the State education system, which wants nothing more to do with the scheme, and which wishes to terminate its participation or, to use the term in the schedule, "revoke the determination".<br><br>
That is not beyond the bounds of possibility, because I understand that some grant-aided or former grant-aided schools fear that their viability is still under threat, as the assisted places scheme may not give them the same kind of assistance as they receive at present under the grant aid scheme. Doubts have been expressed by people who teach in some of those schools, and many of them would like the present system of grant aid to continue rather than for it to be replaced by the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I believe that schools should not be given the opportunity of participating in the assisted places scheme or the grant aid scheme. One mistake made by the last Labour Government was that they were far too generous in phasing out the former system of grant aid. They should have chopped it as soon as they came into office instead of trying to phase it out gently over a five-year period. The result of that was that many of these schools have hung on. They just played for time in the hope that the Tories would get in at the next general election. The Tories did not get much approval in Scotland for their policies at the last general election, but unfortunately they received a majority of seats throughout the United Kingdom.<br><br>
When the Tory Party came into office, it did not adhere to any time scale, but immediately increased the amount of money going in grant aid to the schools. The result is that the amount of grant aid received by schools now is almost four times the amount of aid which they received before the Tories came to office.<br><br>
I know that some people in these schools believe that the assisted places scheme is imperfect. In terms of educational and financial viability I hope that some of these schools at some future date will consider joining the State system of education. That would open the doors to a wider range of children instead of just catering for the selected, elitist few. If a school decides to take such steps the Government should facilitate the changeover. There should not be a written three years' notice to do so, as required by the schedule.<br><br>
The only flexibility allowed under paragraph 1 is:
<br><blockquote><p>"such shorter notice as he"</p></blockquote>
—the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"may in any particular case accept".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, a board of governors may wish to cease its participation in the assisted places scheme in, say, the following week, to co-operate fully in a changeover to the comprehensive system, and agree with the local education authority about full participation in the comprehensive system, and yet, according to the schedule, the Secretary of State may, if he wishes, hold it to the three years' written notice. I think that that is grossly unfair. That is why I think that there is a great deal of merit in the amendment which seeks to replace the three years' written notice by notice of one year. I maintain that it should be even shorter notice.<br><br>
If a school sees the light and recognises the nonsense
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
of the assisted places scheme and eventually, on educational and other grounds, wishes to participate fully in the State system, a Government, whatever their political complexion, should give it full co-operation and encouragement rather than hold it to a three-year contract.<br><br>
Amendment No. 205 refers to paragraph 3 of the schedule, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may revoke a determination in respect of a school by giving three years written notice to the proprietors or managers of the school."</p></blockquote>
I fail to see the reason for that provision, whatever the political complexion of the Secretary of State concerned. For example, he may decide that a school should not participate in the assisted places scheme because the amount of money allowed for the scheme will not be as much as he had hoped for, because of the massive cuts in education expenditure.<br><br>
The Treasury will bring more and more pressure to bear on the Scottish Office and every department within it, including the Scottish Education Department. Even the stubborn, bone-headed Minister, who does not seem to be listening to my remarks and who appears to be incapable of replying to our constructive points, may eventually see the light and question whether it is possible to continue to cut expenditure for the 95-96 per cent, of children in local education authority schools while giving out millions of pounds for the scheme. If a Minister decides to scrap the whole scheme or to reduce the number of participating schools, he should be able to do it as soon as possible.<br><br>
Another reason could crop up for abolishing the scheme quickly, or for reducing the participation of some schools in it. As I have already said, many of these schools leave much to be desired. I believe that parents who participate in the scheme are being conned; they imagine that their children will receive superior education, but, from what I hear, that is not so. I hope that the Minister will ensure that these schools are adequately inspected by the inspectors, because many of the facilities are disgraceful. Furthermore, many of those who teach in them probably would not be recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland. So I hope that when the Minister receives adverse reports from his inspectors about particular schools, he will decide that they are no longer fit to participate in the scheme.<br><br>
There is, for example, Loretto school, which has produced a number of infamous former pupils, such as the Solicitor-General for Scotland. He is supposed to be looking after law and order in Scotland, but it is now crumbling, partly as a result of the Government's disgraceful policies. If the Minister decided that because of the infamy of the school's former pupils or its inferior quality of education, because of some of its teachers' lack of qualifications, or because of many other doubtful aspects, the school should be struck off the record as being no longer fit to participate in the scheme, he should be able to take that decision immediately. The Secretary of State should not be bound by a sort of three-year contract as laid down in paragraph 3. Therefore, I see no reason why the Secretary of State should be statute-bound to give three years' written notice to the proprietors or managers of any school that the Minister may think is unfit to receive a large amount of public money.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
Conservative Members always talk negatively about taxpayers' money going down the drain and about public expenditure. I have always maintained that most public expenditure in education is really public investment. But there are some exceptions, and this scheme is one of them. It is money down the drain to put pupils into disreputable organisations such as Fettes, Loretto and other schools mentioned on the provisional list of participating schools.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will listen seriously to these points and give a better reply than the one that he has attempted so far. If a decision is taken that a school, group of schools or, indeed, all of the schools participating in the scheme are no longer' worthy of receiving public expenditure in this way, the decision ought to be taken immediately.<br><br>
We sometimes learn from our past mistakes. I think that even this thick-headed and stubborn Tory Government can learn from some of the mistakes made by the previous Labour Government, who made the mistake of not phasing out—<i>[Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it fair to my hon Friend the Member for West Stirling shire (Mr. Canavan) to be barracked once again by the' hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) <i>i</i> The hon Gentleman is a renowned world traveller, and for him to hurl abuse at my hon Friend, who is trying to secure justice for oppressed peoples, is most offensive and completely out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Chair rather than the Committee to determine. There are times when one allows a little banter between the two sides, but I do not treat sedentary interruptions lightly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Do you think that this is the first known case of St. George coming to the aid of the dragon?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a spurious point of order. We should proceed with the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for coming to my defence. I notice that the question of my absence last week was raised by some Conservative Members, who doubted whether I was away on parliamentary business, which they might want to check with the Whips' office. I do not know whether they realise—if you will allow me half a minute, Mr. Gourlay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman might make his explanation privately. I think that sufficient has been said to acquaint the Committee of the reason for the hon Gentleman's absence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Gourlay, the British Government and Parliament are responsible for education, not just in Scotland but also ultimately in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Chairman makes a ruling, he expects it to be observed. We are discussing education in Scotland, not Hong Kong.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your guidance. I was rudely interrupted by the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West—[Hon Members: " East."]— for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie); the other hon Member is a useless Minister, rather than a useless Back Bencher.<br><br>
In amendment No. 205 we are trying to reduce the statutory requirement from three years to one year. I know that my hon Friend is heading in the right direction with the amendment and I shall certainly sup port him, but I would go even further and say that once a decision had been taken that a school, for whatever reason, should not be participating in the scheme, that was it. The Secretary of State should have the power forthwith.<br><br>
I suspect that part of the reason why the three years' notice is written into paragraph 3 is that this Tory Government know that their days are numbered. They know that at the next general election—the sooner that comes, the better—we shall sweep the board. There may be a handful of Tories, a few Social Democrats—from former Tory seats, not from former Labour seats— Liberals, and such like. But, with our massive majority after the next general election, we shall want to abolish the assisted places scheme immediately, if it is still in operation, instead of using the far too generous system of phase-out, which we decided upon in 1974.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman explain how he would propose to pay for the cost of educating all the extra pupils who would then come into the State system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On termination of the assisted-places scheme, the schools may not want to co-operate in Comprehensive reorganisation within the local education authority system. But there is no reason why they should not, and no reason at all why some of their traditions, customs, ideals and educational philosophy should not continue under the State system and be fully integrated into it under a more open-door policy.<br><br>
I do not want to abolish these schools. I want to encourage them to participate in a comprehensive system in order to open their doors to a wider range of children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon Gentleman care to answer the question that I put to him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon Gentleman care to repeat his question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon Gentleman pay for the education of the children who would then fall back on the State system?</span></p>
<p>11am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman does not seem to realise that as part of our programme we would restore the many cuts that the Government have made in investment in education. If we simply shifted the millions of pounds that are to be spent on education for the few children in the assisted places scheme into the public sector of education, that would be a significant injection of more public investment in education.<br><br>
The children at those schools could stay there, if the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
schools wished to co-operate in a comprehensive system. If the schools wanted to go it alone and the parents said, "Right—we're taking our children out of those schools", there should be ample places for the children—with even the present Government's projections of school rolls—within the local education authority system. I see no danger at all there.<br><br>
Ultimately, of course, the next Labour Government may well make it illegal for any school to charge fees. I for one hope that they will. In that case there would be a mass exodus from those schools, because they would then have either to co-operate in a free comprehensive system for all children or cease to exist. But I do not want to abolish the schools; I want to give them every encouragement—financial, educational, social and otherwise—to co-operate within the State system in a fully comprehensive network of schools. There is no reason why they should not.<br><br>
However, I see why those who drafted the Bill included the three-year stipulation in paragraph 3. My hon Friends and I are not stupid, and it is easy to see through this move. The Government are virtually throwing in the towel. They are saying that there will in all probability be a Labour Government after the next general election, and that one of the first priorities of that Government will be to abolish the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
I hope that we shall abolish the scheme not within our first year, and not within our first month, but within the first week after we take power. I am sure that the vast majority of parents, teachers and pupils throughout Scotland will give three hefty cheers and thank Heaven for a Labour Government that are acting quickly. But if the Bill goes through it will be necessary for us to pass legislation too. That will not put us off, because, with a massive majority, we could perhaps push through such legislation within the first week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member has departed somewhat from the amendment. While there is an agreement, the hon Member should keep to the rules of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would reduce the three years' statutory written notice to one year. I am saying that one year would be a great improvement on three years. Three years is more than half the maximum lifetime of a Parliament. It is ludicrous that the Secretary of State should have to give three years' notice to participating schools.<br><br>
This discredited Government never received any mandate from the people of Scotland for their assisted places scheme or any of their other disastrous policies on education and other matters in Scotland. If a new Secretary of State comes to power with a fresh mandate from the people of Scotland, and indeed the people of the whole United Kingdom, surely he should be able, as one of his first priorities and within as short a time as possible, to terminate that scheme forthwith. He should not be tied by the three-year rule in the schedule.<br><br>
I therefore hope that those Conservative hon Gentlemen who are interested, as I and my hon Friends are, in the construction and retention and maintenance of democracy, will heed what has been said in support of the amendments and will see that one year's written notice is at least an improvement on the three years'

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 207, in page 55, line 21, after "school", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"by having annual inspections of the schools".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 206, in page 55, line 26, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(c) is satisfied that the participating school is not applying an entrance acceptance procedure which will ensure a wide ability range of pupils participating in the scheme.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were shocked last week by the Minister's somewhat cavalier attitude towards the criteria that he applied to participating schools. He said that virtually any school which applied could be included provided it was given a clean bill of health by the SED—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By HMI.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to confuse the SED officials with Her Majesty's inspectors of schools. I appreciate that both have the same paymaster but operate under different heads. One group is answerable to the Secretary of State while the other is answerable to the Secretary of State by a different route. Sometimes the two do not speak or consult each other.<br><br>
The HMIs' cursory glance at these institutions prior to their acceptance into the scheme as participating schools tends to suggest that HMIs should return on a regular basis, that there should be a corps of HMIs with responsibility for examining the schools and comparing them with, and making sure that they measure up to, the best in the local authority sector. It is essential that there be annual inspections of the participating schools, in every department. We should look closely at the standards of educational provision and the achievements of pupils, not only in public examinations but in their ability to communicate and understand the work.<br><br>
We should also like the inspectors to look at the schools' facilities. They should ensure that in, say, science laboratories, there are equipment and facilities comparable with those in the local authority sector and that the teaching is of a standard regarded by the inspectors and such organisations as the General Teaching Council as being of a high standard in keeping with the best traditions of Scottish education.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
(Mr. Canavan), in his characteristically robust fashion, has drawn attention to what may be regarded as the shortcomings of certain private schools in Scotland. I know that his remarks are well intended and that he makes them within the privileged position of the House. He is well experienced and versed in educational matters, and consequently he speaks with some authority, but even he, as a former assistant head teacher in one of Scotland's largest schools, would concede that we are, to an extent, talking in ignorance.<br><br>
We do not know adequately what goes on in these institutions. They are shrouded in mystery and in the PR razzmatazz of the advertising brochures which they provide for potential parents. Annual inspections would strip away the veneer of these institutions. It would have a salutary effect on the quality of teaching, and the administrative staff would be kept on their toes by the visits of the inspectorate.<br><br>
We recognise that that may involve an increase in the size of the inspectorate. We also recognise that it could eventually frighten off some of the participating schools. We make no apology for that, because we believe that if taxpayers' money is to be spent on education it should be spent wisely. That is one of the reasons why we are concerned about the scheme. We recognise that the £5 million necessary to fund the scheme will be at the expense of education in the State sector.<br><br>
Schools administered by education authorities are run in a sensible and well organised manner. They are open to public scrutiny at every turn through the medium of the education committee. That scrutiny enables us to say that the standard of education provided in the local authority sector is still fairly high.<br><br>
As the Government's cuts begin to sink ever deeper, there will be great problems for the local authority sector. We believe that the danger to local authority education is considerable, and we want to make sure that the warnings given by the General Teaching Council about the quality and standard of education will be heeded by the Minister.<br><br>
We also believe that we cannot say for sure that the participating schools, consistently across the board, provide education of such a high standard. Some of the schools insist on fairly academic achievement before entry. Others do not do so and simply afford the social cachet of a fee-paying education which is attached to the restricted social groupings from which the pupils in such schools come.<br><br>
Therefore, we are not confident about the academic standards of all the schools which will participate in the scheme. We believe that it is incumbent upon the Minister to ensure that academic provision within these institutions is of the highest possible standard. That does not mean that we are talking in elitist terms about the achievement of more O-grades and higher-grade passes by those schools which present children for those exams. Many of these schools present their pupils mainly for English examinations to prepare them for English universities rather than Scottish institutions of higher and further education.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The amendment gives us the opportunity to ask the Minister to justify the inclusion of schools on academic grounds. We recognise that parents are willingly paying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
fees, but perhaps schools should be subject to the Trade Descriptions Act in the same way as other bodies ^offering services. We should like the Minister to have a tighter rein on participating schools.<br><br>
We do not believe that it is desirable for a Minister to interfere directly with education in schools. He should not be like the French education Minister, who can look at his watch and say that at that moment all French school children are studying specific subjects on the school timetable. We do not envisage the application of such a straitjacket to our educational system. We envisage having standards which do not necessarily relate to the achievement of pupils in terms of high academic awards. We are concerned to provide an education which will enable children to realise their full potential regardless of their ability. That can best be achieved by annual inspection of participating schools.<br><br>
In amendment No. 206 we return to a well-worn 'path in the Bill, down which the Minister has refused to travel. Once again, at this late hour, we give him a chance to say that he should be satisfied, before schools are included as participating institutions, that their entrance procedures will ensure that they accept a wide ability range of pupils. We want it to be made clear that the entrance requirements of participating schools will not allow them to take only young people of high ability—" bright" pupils as they are described in the Conservative Party manifesto.<br><br>
We hope that at this late hour the Minister will accept responsibility for controlling the entrance procedures of these institutions, and that he will not, as he and his fellow Ministers have done so often when introducing legislation since the general election—at least legislation from the Scottish Office—adopt the attitude of Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of the affair and say that the responsibility lies with the schools themselves. The aim of amendment No. 206 is that the Secretary of State should be satisfied that participating schools will use entrance procedures which will ensure that there is the widest possible range of ability in the schools, and that the young people participating in the assisted places scheme will not be exclusively from the high ability ranges but will be across the board in ability and aptitude.<br><br>
Together, the two amendments are concerned with the participation of schools in the scheme and entry into the scheme. We would insist that, within 12 months of the scheme's being set up, the Minister should be able to say that certain schools should not proceed further because they were not up to scratch. We would also hope that the Minister would be able to say that there would be a spread of young people in the schools which would not simply reflect the ability of a small group of children to pass examinations.<br><br>
There is a danger here—not one that we have raised so far, but one which we ought to consider—of young people being sent by their parents to crammers to take advantage of the system. We know that some socially ambitious parents will be prepared to invest in one year's cramming to ensure that their children will be able to pass entrance examinations. The only way in which the Minister can get round that danger is by adding our proposed paragraph (c) to the schedule.<br><br>
We reiterate themes that we have introduced in the past, because this is probably our last opportunity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
before Report, to draw the Minister's attention to them, or to give him the chance, at this late hour, to repent of his past omissions. I commend amendments Nos. 207 and 206 in the hope that the Minister will think again.<br><br>
I know that my hon Friends will be desperate to join my appeal to the Minister at the last minute to reconsider the entrance procedure and to ensure that, if we must have this wretched scheme, it will contain schools with proven records which will be subject to continual inspection by Her Majesty's inspectors of schools. They are responsible to the Secretary of State and are not, with the greatest respect to those employed by the Scottish Education Department, simply bureaucrats. They are educationists with a long and distinguished record in Scottish education. We could ask that no better group be responsible for the inspection of participating schools.<br><br>
If the inspections were to be carried out annually that would go some way to allay the fears and misgivings of those of us with genuine doubts and suspicions about the quality of education provided by many fee-paying schools. We recognise that as a result of such annual inspections, the number of opportunities under the scheme might reduce, because some schools might not be fit to participate in the scheme. If that is so, we say "Good luck" to the inspectors and their work. We have said time and again that we do not approve of the scheme, even in those instances where the education provided will be of a standard that would bear comparison with that available in the local authority sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never had an unqualified admiration or enthusiasm for Her Majesty's inspectors of schools. Like teachers, they vary in quality. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are mediocre, and sometimes they are useless. My experience of inspectors supposedly advising teachers in my department what to do and what not to do was such that I told one of the head teachers not to bother to bring them back into the school. But the inspectors have statutory responsibilities, and as long as the Secretary of State has a statutory responsibility to ensure that schools are of a certain standard, we need an inspectorate of some kind.<br><br>
The whole selection system at St. Andrew's House may work on the old boy network. It seems to select certain types of people to be inspectors—many of them refugees from the classroom, with little, if any, teaching experience. Their qualifications may look good on paper, but they have little experience of the hurly-burly of modern comprehensive schools in Scotland. Many inspectors, if they have teaching qualifications, are products of, and have had teaching experience in, the schools included in the provisional list of participants in the assisted-places scheme.<br><br>
However, I do not want to stray out of order by unduly criticising the selection of the inspectorate. I certainly favour some system of inspection although the present system leaves much to be desired. But the inspectorate's job is, or should be, to inspect not only the local education authority schools but the independent and grant-aided schools as well as those which will be termed participatory schools under this disastrous scheme. If those schools were to be in-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
spected, the inspectors would have a better idea about them.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary is a product of a good local education authority school. He is, 1 believe, the only Scottish Office Minister who went to such a school, all the others having attended the Tory old-boy network of fee-paying schools of one sort or another, some of which I have heard of. There may be some ministerial experience of those schools, because all Ministers, apart from the Under-Secretary with responsibility for education, went to them. Nevertheless, the Minister should not listen only to his hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is not sufficient, because, although those schools may once have had certain qualities, they may now, owing to infrequent inspection—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman's</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>attention having been called to the fact that six hon Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other hon Members having come into the room and six hon Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not rely on his ministerial pals for information about what goes on in those schools. At one time private, fee-paying schools may have been good, bad or mediocre, but times change. Some which may have had good reputations 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when the Ministers attended them, may now be dens of iniquity. Therefore, the Minister should find out exactly what is happening.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon Gentleman would be interested in information from the Secretary of State. Even though English public schools cannot participate in the scheme, many of the Scottish schools on the provisional list of participants seem to model their system on the type of school to which the Secretary of State for Scotland sends his children. The <i>Glasgow Herald</i> states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the laird tradition the Youngers have all been educated at English public schools".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State is quoted as saying that he attended Winchester. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I wanted the boys to go to Winchester because I do believe it gives the most marvellous start in life. At Winchester you are always able to be an individualist. In my day, despite all the general emphasis on excelling at sport, you could be a butterfly fancier at Winchester and still hold your head up high.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"At 19, during National Service when I was in Korea— the worst experience of my life—you were suddenly dumped on a hillside in a temperature miles below zero and there was something in that Winchester background that sustained you. I don't know what it is but it is there."</p></blockquote>
11.30 am<br><br>
That may well have been true of Winchester when the Secretary of State for Scotland went there. It may also be true about some of the schools in the provisional list of participatory schools which has already been published by the Secretary of State. But when inspectors make an annual—I suggest it should be more frequent—inspection of these schools they should have regard to activities other than butterfly fancying and the educating of potential invaders of Korea. It is important that the inspectorate should have a wide look at the curriculum within these schools, the academic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
attainment, and the educational qualifications of the teachers.<br><br>
What are the present rules with regard to the powers of the inspectorate to inspect grant-aided schools and independent schools? What powers already exist in statute for inspectors to enter those schools, and how frequently are those powers used?<br><br>
I have heard some dreadful tales about what goes on in some of these schools. I have heard about incompetent teachers, inadequate teaching facilities, teachers refusing the children the breadth of curriculum in academic subjects or even in sport by forcing them to play rugby and not allowing them to play association football, which is a far more popular sport in Scotland than rugby football. What reports about these matters has the Minister received from the inspectorate?<br><br>
In fact, are these schools ever inspected? There seems to be a great deal of ignorance on the part of the Minister and the Scottish Office about the qualities, or otherwise, of these schools. Therefore, I am in favour of inspectors entering these schools, on the basis outlined by my hon Friend.<br><br>
If the schools do not measure up to what the Minister thinks are proper educational standards, they should be scrubbed from the assisted places scheme. In fact, they ought to be closed down. The Minister should have a comprehensive inspection of every school in Scotland outside the local education authority structure before allowing any school to participate in the scheme. Even the schools which do not want to participate should be inspected. I suspect that part of the reason why those schools have not put their names down to participate may be that they are afraid that the inspectors will discover inadequacies and imperfections, which might give them a bad reputation.<br><br>
Will the Minister say specifically what powers he already has to send inspectors to grant-aided schools and independent schools, how frequently those powers are used and how frequently he looks at inspectors' reports? Has he, in fact, ever looked at any inspector's report about any school outside the local education authority sector in Scotland? It is important that the Minister answer my questions. If this mad scheme gets off the ground, the least he can do is to ensure that educational standards are up to scratch in these schools by having inspections, at least annually.<br><br>
I turn to amendment No. 206, the purpose of which is to ensure that, whatever selection system the schools operate, they try to cater for a wide ability range of pupils. Some of the schools admittedly appear, on paper, to have good academic records. If one looks at the number of higher passes, the number of sixth-year studies passes, the number of pupils going on to colleges and universities, even I admit that some of them appear to have very good academic records. The Minister may say that that is why parents would wish to send their children to those schools.<br><br>
If one compares some, though not all, of those schools with a comprehensive school in a very depressed area, one will find that on paper there is a difference in academic attainment. That is not surprising—not that academic attainment is the sole criterion of educational success. If one is considering pure academic attainment, the numbers of pupils going on to colleges and universities and into the professions—some into dishonourable professions such as membership of the House of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 623</span>
Commons, and some perhaps becoming Cabinet Ministers and mismanaging the economy and many other—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> On a point of order. Is it right for an hon Member to suggest that we sit in a dishonourable House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have said "less honourable". I was referring to the profession, not the House. 1 think my words were "some dishonourable profession such as membership of the House". I will gladly withdraw the word "dishonourable", but I will substitute "less honourable", because I think that many other professions are more honourable than membership of the House of Commons. I hope that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) will accept that point. I always considered, when I came here from the teaching profession, that I had been not promoted but relegated. I was relegated to a less honourable profession.<br><br>
On paper some of those schools may appear to have good academic records compared with, for example, comprehensive schools in areas of multiple deprivation. But it is not surprising that such schools should appear, on paper, to have good academic records. The Minister may be able to update the information, but I think that the most recent comprehensive survey of the grant-aided and independent schools in Scotland was in volume III of the second report of the Public Schools Commission, published in 1970. A good deal of research was done into the methods by which those schools selected their pupils. It is clear that, as a result of the hyper-selection that goes on in some of the schools, the distribution in the intake in SI—the first year of secondary school—was not by any means normal. It was very much skewed above the mean verbal reasoning quotient of 100.<br><br>
Some of the statistics in the report showed how some of the schools operated their selection system. Consideration of the selection system operated by the schools is relevant to the amendment. We want to ensure through the amendment that there is some kind of comprehensive intake into those schools. The Minister seems at least partially to deny that only very bright pupils would benefit from the assisted places scheme, although there is nothing in statute to say so—if "benefit" is the right word. I take the view that very bright pupils are better off in a comprehensive school anyway. But if it is the Minister's intention that pupils other than the very bright should be given an opportunity to participate in the scheme, he should take a good look at the selection system operated by some of the schools.<br><br>
If the statistics are outdated, the Minister, in his reply, may be able to give us some more up-to-date statistics. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1968-69 the admissions to class SI showed that the majority of children entering class SI of grant-aided schools come from the primary departments of grant-aided schools."</p></blockquote>
The report then gives some statistics. It states that 1,410 children—more than half of class 1 of the secondary intake—came from the primary department of the same school. Sixty per cent, of pupils in the secondary department of George Watson's college were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
virtually assured of places there because they happened to have been in the primary department. The same applied to those who had been in the primary department of George Heriot's school. So 60 per cent, of the entry to these schools came from the primary department of the same school. Some 833 children, or 35 per cent., came from education authority schools.<br><br>
The Minister has often said that he would like children from local authority schools to benefit from the assisted places scheme, although the number benefiting will be small. It appears that only about one-third of the pupils in these schools at present come from education authority schools. I suggest that the proportion may now be even less due to the increase in fees since 1970 because of the phasing out of the grant aid, and, although the Government have almost quadrupled the amount of grant aid, it has been a recent innovation since the 1979 general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon Gentleman that the principle of the assisted places scheme was debated on Second Reading and was again debated on several of the clauses before the Committee. The hon Member will be guilty of tedious repetition if he continues along those lines. He should return to the details of the amendment before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. When I began, I was addressing my remarks to amendment No. 206, which aims to ensure that selection systems operated by such schools will produce a wide range of ability in their entrants.<br><br>
I am trying to establish that the system now operated by the schools does not ensure a wide range of ability in children entering the schools. The figures that I quoted from the report showed that 60 per cent, of the secondary intake came from the primary department of the same school, 35 per cent, from education authority schools, 3½ per cent, from independent schools and 1½ per cent, from other schools. The report refers to the wide variation of selection systems operated by such schools.<br><br>
Many of these schools may be disreputable—and there are many to which I certainly would not like any of my children to go—but it appears that the number of applications to some of them exceeds the number of places available. Therefore, practically all of them have to operate some form of selection— whether based on some form of bias, such as that a parent or an older brother or sister attended the school, which ensures that the child gets a place, or that the child had been in the primary department of the same school which appears to mean that he is automatically selected for a place in the secondary department.<br><br>
The report also refers to schools which have "a battery of tests and interviews". Will the Minister tell us what these tests and interviews are? Many of these tests have been virtually discredited by educationists the world over. Even the former tests of intelligence or verbal reasoning quotients, although they may be useful indicators in some respects, are by no means the permanent stamp of innate ability which some educationists 10, 20 or 30 years ago imagined them to be. I am not saying that their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
verbal reasoning quotient has been completely discredited. It is still a useful indicator, but it is no longer seen to be something immutable, and it should never be used as the sole predictor of a child's future.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
What kind of tests are the schools using at present? It is incumbent on the Minister to tell us. Are they using the Moray House verbal reasoning quotient test or are they just using some out-dated method of testing which has never been proven? If a testing system is used to select the children for a school within the assisted places scheme, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that the tests are fair, which would show that the school was trying to cater for a wide range of ability?<br><br>
It is clear from the report that many of these schools—if we talk about them collectively—are not dealing with anything like a normal distribution of intelligence of children in Scotland. Many teachers in comprehensive schools are doing a great job dealing with children of mixed ability, whose verbal reasoning quotient may vary from 140-plus down to 70-tminus. I have taught in classes which have had that full range of ability. Such classes do not exist in the grant-aided and independent schools because they do not seem to have the range of ability which would be expected to exist in a comprehensive school.<br><br>
Unless amendment No. 206 is accepted, the Minister will, apparently, be going back on his words. That is nothing new for this Minister, but he has been on record as saying that there is nothing to exclude the less gifted child from participating in the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
In support of my contention, I should like to quote a paragraph from the report which demonstrates that at present these schools do not have a wide range of ability within their intake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must reiterate what I have already said. This is not a wide-ranging debate. It should be dealing with the revocation of the determinations for the purposes of the assisted places scheme. The quality of the schools and their standards has been debated before. The hon Member cannot return to the Committee after an absence and start to repeat the arguments which have already been debated. I am ruling quite tightly on the discussions of the amendments. I have allowed the hon Member to go fairly wide of the amendment, but now he should draw his remarks to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was concluding, Mr. Gourlay. I wish in no way to challenge your ruling. However, amendment No. 206 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"at end insert—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) is satisfied that the participating school is not applying an entrance acceptance procedure which will ensure a wide ability range of pupils participating in the scheme."</p></blockquote>
I am trying to establish, with the help of well-researched evidence from the Public Schools Commission, that at present these schools do not have anything like the wide range of ability. That is why some of the schools appear to have good higher and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
six-year studies passes, university and college entrants and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the strict interpretation of the amendment, which refers to the intake under the assisted places scheme and not to the general intake of the school, which I think is the argument that the hon Member is trying to advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for your guidance. But the schools mentioned by the Minister in his provisional list are all those which were the subject of intensive study 10 years ago, the results of which were published in the Public Schools Commission report. I should like to place on record what the report says. It is important that the Committee should realise that these schools do not at present have a full mixed-ability intake. If the assisted places scheme—</span></p>

I have already indicated to the hon Member that that part of the debate has been pursued on Second Reading and extensively in Committee.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may conclude by saying that I hope that the Minister will take steps to discover what ability range the schools are at present catering for and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister would, in view of my ruling, be out of order if he started to go along that line.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Gourlay, for your interventions in the speech of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who, in a huff as usual, is walking out of the Committee in a childish and petty way.

The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) opened by being rather critical of HMI and concluded by praising HMI.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister develops that erroneous line, I should tell him that I said that I thought that the cursory treatment of schools in respect of their inclusion in the scheme had not been satisfactory. My point was that the acceptance of schools, by whoever was responsible, had been based on what can only be called a cursory glance. I think that the Minister's admission earlier in our debate is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
evidence of that. He did not stipulate how closely the schools should be examined before being included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is wriggling. He did accuse the inspectorate of taking only a cursory glance at the schools wishing to be included in the scheme. I gather from what he has just said that he does not know whether it made a full inspection or took a cursory glance. He is using criticism as a method of exploring just what sort of investigation took place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member, who is already late in joining the Committee and is totally unadvised about the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. My membership of the Committee was not a matter over which I had control. It is entirely improper for the Minister to bring it up in such a snide way, which is so typical of him. I should be grateful if you would rule him out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There was nothing out of order in the Minister's remarks. As I understood them, he was referring to the hon Gentleman's attendance this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed I was, Mr. Gourlay. It would do the hon Gentleman a great deal of good if he would sit down, shut up and open his ears for a while, and learn something about the Bill before he comes storming in like the South Ayrshire cavalry, trying to rescue his hon Friends too late in the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should get back to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 207 is unnecessary. All independent and grant-aided schools are subject to continuing review by Her Majesty's inspectors of schools. In addition, all the schools which will participate in the scheme have recently been the subject of a specific assessment by the inspectorate, and my Department has a current appreciation of their position. That is a full and clear explanation of what has happened prior to the admission of schools to the assisted places scheme and in regard to the regular, continuing inspection of schools by Her Majesty's inspectors,<br><br>
I assure the Committee that, in view of the demands of public accountability, the participating schools will be kept under review, and up-to-date information will be available to my right hon Friend on the basis of which he will be able to consider whether there is a case for revoking a particular determination, without resort to formal annual inspections, as suggested in the amendment.<br><br>
The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who is still out of the Committee in a huff, asked about the powers of inspection. It is only out of the kindness of my heart that I shall answer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
that point. It might be helpful for the record, but certainly not for the discourteous hon Gentleman, who spoke for an hour or so and then left the Committee. If I may say so, I think that he is more in huff with you, Mr. Gourlay, than he is with me, but I am sure that you need not worry about that. Section 66 of the 1980 Act empowers the Secretary of State to have inspected, whenever he thinks fit, every school or college
<br><blockquote><p>"at such intervals as appear to him to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
That includes, of course, independent and grant-aided schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 206 seeks to include, as an additional ground for the revocation of a determination in paragraph 4, the operation of an "entrance assessment procedure". A wide variety of choice of these schools already exists. One of the main attractions of the independent sector of education is that most of the schools have an individual character and style of their own, qualities which I should like to see broadened within the State system of schools. I hate the idea, which the Opposition continue to argue, that one school should be identical to another and that the quality of education in one school should be identical to that of another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. When my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was speaking, I thought that you said that you would rule the Minister out of order if he spoke about the quality of schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. During the course of the debate I have allowed certain references to the schools. However, the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was advancing an argument about the standard of the schools in general. I think that the hon Gentleman can leave it to the Chair to rule accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the late-comer, the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), is also still huffy this morning, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that that will give you no trouble at all.<br><br>
The point is that the State sector has much to learn about choice and variety from independent schools, and I encourage schools in the State sector to create their own identity and to exhibit their own strengths as schools as much as possible.<br><br>
However, as I have said, a wide variety of choice exists in the private sector. The 42 participating schools cover a wide spectrum of educational provision. Some are selective, although even they are not exclusively so, as, for example, they tend to admit brothers and sisters of established pupils without too much emphasis on ability. Others admit pupils by reference to other criteria.<br><br>
This variety within the independent sector is a very desirable complement to the system which operates in the public sector, and I regard their contribution to the educational system in Scotland as invaluable. Indeed, this variety is one of the things that the independent sector is all about, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 629</span>
we would not wish to restrict it in any way. Therefore, I ask my hon Friends to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to goodness that the Minister would take some time out of what I know must be a busy schedule to visit some of the local authority schools. If he did, he would see a variety which is much greater than that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon Gentleman proceeds to go into a description of the State school system, I must tell him that I allowed the Minister to make some replies to points made by Opposition Members. I do not propose to allow the debate to proceed in a wider form now, as we have nearly reached a conclusion on the amendments. The hon Gentleman may speak to the amendments, but I shall not allow a discussion on the values of comprehensive schools as opposed to those of private schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention the values of comprehensive education, Mr. Gourlay. I merely took up the Minister's points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has already replied to the hon Gentleman, and I am not prepared to allow further debate on that matter.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I listened with some interest to that part of the Minister's remarks in which he sought to reply to certain statements made by my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and me. From what I gather, we were given only a list of assertions which were not replies. Therefore, I feel that it is necessary for those of us who have misgivings about the quality of private sector education—we believe that it is not as closely examined as the public sector—to seek to establish a balance in the argument when comparing the two sectors. That is what my hon Friend is trying to achieve and that is why we believe that his points are in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) completely misconstrued the purpose of schedule 4 as well as his own amendments. I repeat for the third time that the principle of the assisted places scheme has been decided by the House, it has been debated in relation! to the relevant clauses, and we are now discussing a very narrow point on the schedule. Mistakenly, perhaps, I allowed the debate to go somewhat wide of the amendments. I hope to bring the debate back into line, so I am ruling that from now on any discussion must be narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Amendment No. 206 refers to the "entrance acceptance procedure" of participating schools. I do not want to enter into a wide-ranging
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
debate about the general principle of the scheme, and I accept that this is a strict and narrowly-defined amendment, but would it not be in order for us to discuss the entrance acceptance procedures of those schools which are referred to in the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I will allow that in so far as it applies to pupils who participate in the scheme. That is what restricts the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we understand that it depends on what side of the room we sit, Mr. Gourlay —[Hon Members: "Oh! "]—Conservative Members can say "Oh", but that appears to be true. We had to listen while the Minister read out what seemed to be an SED brief—that is, a public relations exercise for private schools. I am not surprised that its writers provided him with such a brief, as so many of them went to grant-aided and private schools, and also send their children to them. That is why I find it all somewhat despicable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The chips are showing on the hon Gentleman's shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Scotland we have a Secretary of State, a Minister and a Scottish Education Department that seem to be more interested in the private sector than in the public sector. That shows their sense of priorities.<br><br>
However, the Minister failed to answer even those points that were certainly in order—I think that they were all in order—made by my hon Friends the Members for West Stirlingshire and Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). Those matters concerned the type of inspection that has already taken place in private schools. The Minister read out a very carefully worded text about a continuing review that is taking place. He did not say where, how often or what aspects had been covered by it. He failed to answer our points.<br><br>
I think that it is valid for my hon Friends and me, and others, to ask about the inspections that have been made, and it is right that we should be given a detailed reply by the Minister. Rather than making rude remarks about my hon Friend and me, the Minister would have been much better occupied in answering the points that had been raised—just as he would now be better occupied in paying attention to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for this thick-skinned Minister to sit with his back to the Chairman of the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Minister is out of order, I will certainly pull him up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was all right in throwing rude remarks at my hon Friend and me, but he is just as huffy and just as ignorant when he does not pay attention to what is being said. The Minister should intervene again and tell us exactly when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
inspections were made, how many times each private school was inspected, and what areas the inspections covered. If he is not able to do that, he will not have answered any of the points, our amendment will still be valid, and I hope that hon Members will support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) suggested that my hon Friend the Minister had not replied to the questions about inspections. Perhaps the hon Member, with his wide knowledge of educational matters, can give me his interpretation of lines 20 and 21 of the schedule, which state that the Secretary of State may revoke the determination if he
<br><blockquote><p>"is not satisfied that apropriate educational standards are being maintained at a participating school".</p></blockquote>
How does the hon Gentleman interpret those lines in relation to the question of physical inspections of schools by inspectors? Do they not provide an adequate safeguard for the Secretary of State on the question of inspections in schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon Member has raised is the very crux of the amendment. We should be grateful to him for seeing the point and drawing the Committee's attention back to it.<br><br>
There is in the schedule a general provision about the Secretary of State's not being satisfied, but it does not say how standards are to be assessed. We saw in the vote on the Budget Resolution that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is a reasonable person. The Minister spends so much time being rude to people that he does not listen to what is being said, but what we want to know is how he interprets the provision. What kind of inspections have already taken place? What matters did the inspections cover? Have they been as detailed and as extensive as the inspections of the local authority schools?<br><br>
That was what we were asking, but all we got in reply, as the hon Gentleman will have heard, was a PR exercise for the private schools, which was totally out of order, although it was not ruled so. That is not what we are here for. We are here to try to find out exactly what is meant by paragraph 4(a), and why the Minister cannot accept the addition that would specify that inspections had to take place annually, so that we would know that there were regular inspections. The Minister is paid a substantial salary to reply to such questions, but he does not seem to be earning it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to revert to the point about the entrance examinations operated by these schools, as they affect children whose parents may want them to participate in the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
Let us suppose that Mrs. McTaggart wants her wee boy to apply for an assisted places scheme, and takes him along to Fettes college or Loretto college and says "I want my boy to go to your school under the assisted places scheme." The head teacher of Loretto may say that wee Johnny McTaggart will have to pass a test in order to get into Loretto. Joe
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
Bloggs is all right, because his old man went to Loretto, Jimmy is all right because his big brother was in Loretto, and if the children of the Solicitor-General for Scotland want to go to Loretto they will get in all right, because the Solicitor-General is also a former pupil. But what about Mrs. McTaggart's wee boy? Will he have to sit a test to be approved?<br><br>
What kind of test will it be? What kind of interview or selection system will it be? Will it be an academic test? Will it be a verbal reasoning quotient test? Will the head teacher ask "Does your father vote Conservative or Labour, or is he a member of this new breakaway cowboy outfit?" What kind of criteria will be used in deciding whether to admit the child to the school? This is the purpose of my hon Friend's amendment, because the present system operated by these schools militates against certain types of pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already referred this morning to the "Canavan benefit match", because we covered this ground at length in our debate on clause 5 last week. I shall explain the scheme for the benefit of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—to make sure that he fully understands it and can explain it to his constituents at his surgery when they want to learn more about it as it becomes public knowledge.<br><br>
An applicant under the assisted places scheme is treated in exactly the same way as any other applicant. Mrs. McTaggart, or anyone else, will apply to have her child admitted to the school. The school will apply the same criteria to her son as to any other child. The assisted place comes into operation only if Mrs. McTaggart's son is offered a place and she wishes to participate in the funding available to her to help her to pay the school fees. The funding is then related to her income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happens if more people apply than there is money available under the bid system? How does the school choose between McTaggart and MoDougall, who both wish to participate in the scheme because they cannot afford to pay the fees, and who have been accepted for entry to the school? How, at the post-entry stage, does the Minister intend to operate the scheme?<br><br>
I believe that this question is in order, because it refers to a schedule which gives effect to the clause that we have just dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schools have made their bids and assessments as to what they think may happen. Over the years they will be able to make more accurate assessments, according to the funds available. I do not think that the problem under the assisted places scheme differs in any way from the problem under the many bursaries and foundations operated by these schools at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It is now clear from what the Minister has said that he has no intention of forcing these schools to change their entrance systems. He says that the selection procedure for a child applying under the assisted places scheme will be exactly the same under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 633</span>
assisted-places scheme as for any other child applying. Therefore, the entrance acceptance procedure referred to in amendment No. 206 surely refers to the general entrance acceptance procedure operated by the school and not just to the assisted place entrance procedure. If it is to be the same entrance procedure for all, the school's normal entrance acceptance procedure is relevant to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon Member has raised would mean that he would require to press the amendment to a Division to get a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay.<br><br>
The entrance acceptance procedures operated by the schools at present are far from satisfactory in ensuring a wide range of ability in the intake of children to such schools. Statistics that I have show that, in rather more than half the grant-aided schools, between 40 per cent, and 55 per cent, of pupils have a verbal reasoning quotient in excess of 110. The corresponding figure for the population in general is 25 per cent. It appears to me, therefore, that the—to quote from the amendment—"entrance acceptance procedures" used by the schools are very selective indeed. They are biased towards the academically-gifted child.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The Minister is on record as saying that he does not want to exclude the less able child from the assisted-places scheme. It is therefore incumbent upon him to tell us how he will ensure that. If he will not accept our amendment, will he take steps to ensure that schools' entrance acceptance procedures—many of them discredited and of no value in the eyes of most educationists—are not biased towards the academically gifted child, and if they are, that they are amended before a school is allowed to participate in the assisted-places scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon Gentleman's question is "No". I can only ask him to read the <i>Official Report</i> of the debates on these matters which he missed last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I had missed every single speech that the Minister made in Committee, I should have missed nothing. He should reply. He is now saying that he will refuse to intervene in any circumstances. In other words, he will give millions of pounds of public money to schools which operate bad and discredited selective systems, which in general seem to favour the academically gifted child. That makes absolute nonsense of the Minister's previous statement that children of any ability will be able to take advantage of the scheme.<br><br>
In any case, the scheme is a load of rubbish. I am sure that most bright children will have bright parents who will see that their needs will be far better met in a good comprehensive school than in the rubbishy schools that stand to benefit from this rubbishy scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that we shall get no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 634</span>
change from the Minister at this stage. But we give notice once again that we shall return to amendment No. 206 on Report. We have been trying since Second Reading to get a satisfactory answer from the Government about the scheme. We are still not happy with the vagueness of the Minister's reply about consideration of the method by which children will be admitted into the scheme, and the way in which it will be possible to admit those in a wide range of educational ability. We do not relent our opposition to the scheme in any way, and we reserve the right to return to the amendment on Report. At some time between now and Report, wiser counsels may prevail upon the Minister. But for now we should like to vote on amendment No. 207.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, amendment No. 207 is the more important of the two, although I take my hon Friend's point about amendment No. 206<br><br>
The Minister's answers on amendment No. 207 were bland in the extreme—Civil Service jargon at its best. There was no attempt to be specific about inspections, such as how long the interval between inspections would be. The Minister merely said that he was satisfied with the inspections, that he was sure that they were adequate, and so on—all the phrases that one might expect.<br><br>
The amendment is about not the introduction of the scheme, but its continuation. I assume that the Minister has ensured that each school that has applied has at least been inspected in part, if not in full. If an inspection had been made some time earlier, the inspectors might have felt that they did not need to make a full inspection again. But normally inspections will take place approximately every five years. Yet paragraph 1 refers to a three-year period for revocation.<br><br>
The Minister should tell the Committee whether the schools will be inspected at least every three years. There is little point in specifying a three-year period for revocation unless there is an absolute guarantee that the schools will be inspected at least every three years. I realise that our yearly inspection would mean extra HMIs, and extra Government expenditure and I am not sure that I should necessarily encourage that.<br><br>
The Minister should tell us whether the inspections carried out are at least sufficient to ensure that paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 can be appropriately managed. He has given a most unsatisfactory answer about the frequency of the inspections. He referred to inspections that might have been done beforehand, but that is not what the schedule is about. It concerns what will happen from now on. There is now a new ball game for the independent schools—although not the grant-aided—schools—which will receive State finance. Therefore, perhaps the inspections should be a little more frequent than they have been in the past.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister, even now, will be prepared to give more specific figures. How often do the inspections take place? Will that be the continuing average, or will he ensure that inspections are more frequent in future?</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 208, in page 55, line 37, leave out paragraph 6.<br><br>
Paragraph 6 concerns the operation of a determination once it has been revoked—that is, the right of pupils to continue to enjoy, if that is the correct word, the benefits, if that is also the correct word, of the assisted-places scheme, once a revocation has taken place. We believe that once a revocation has taken place, the scheme should end, and the pupils should seek further education elsewhere, or pay the full whack for their tuition.<br><br>
We should like to know why the Minister seeks to continue a determination once a revocation has taken place and how it would affect the availability of funds for any other schools which may be admitted into the scheme to replace the school which has had its determination revoked. We believe that the provision is vague. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter, but, as I understand it, pupils in assisted places may be able to stay on at a participating school which has had its determination revoked.<br><br>
One possible problem is that an assisted-place student in a participating school which is found to have an unsatisfactory record, so that the determination is revoked, would be forced to stay at that school because if he wished to travel to another assisted place funds would not be forthcoming.<br><br>
I see that the Minister is looking to his advisers with some desperation. I do not know whether I should carry on until I receive a reply, but I think that I have made the position clear.<br><br>
We are not happy about the scheme. We oppose it completely. We should like to think that, if we were to return to power, we could get the revocation of a determination effected quickly under paragraph 1 of schedule 4, under the proviso—
<br><blockquote><p>"such shorter notice as he"—</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"may in any particular case accept."</p></blockquote>
We do not want to be hamstrung by the problem that, having issued a revocation, we are then unable to give effect to it in the sense of stopping the scheme in respect of these pupils because, somehow, their education will carry on for some time to come.<br><br>
Therefore, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the amendment, which, initially, we consider to be of a probing nature. Of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
course, we reserve the right to push it to a vote if the Minister's answer is unsatisfactory—as it usually is. However, at this stage, we await his remarks with interest, if not with eager anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to think that the Government's and the Opposition's purpose is the same here. We are putting foremost in our minds the position of an assisted-places pupil. The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) laughs at the thought of any consideration being given to individuals. He is one of the supporters of State bureaucracy who have come to this House purely to advance local and State bureaucracy. But, thankfully, I am considering the remarks made by his hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and I can ignore the guffaws of the hon Member for South Ayrshire.<br><br>
In our discussion of this part of the schedule, what matters most is the position of a child under the assisted places scheme. The amendment would cause pupils in an assisted-places school to be left high and dry if the determination were revoked. I hope that that is not the purpose of the hon Gentleman's amendment, although that is the effect that it would have. An important principle of the assisted places scheme is that a child, once admitted, should have the right to retain his place throughout his school career if he wishes to and for as long as his family qualifies for assistance under the income scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the hon Gentleman. His comments are not serious enough to require any time to be taken up by the Committee.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
If the school ceases to participate, the rights of the child must remain. Anything else would be disruptive for him, especially if he were on the verge of taking examinations. But he would not be obliged to remain in the school if, for any reason, the Secretary of State found fault with it under the provisions of the schedule. But we are concerned with preserving the rights of a child to an assisted place. If we accepted the amendment, we should deny the pupil and his family rights to the continued support of the scheme, whatever happened to the school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister mean when he talks about a pupil who has acquired an assisted place?In our previous debate we reached the stage where a pupil's parents apply on his behalf for admission to a school. The pupil is admitted to the school and then provides the necessary information for acceptance under the assisted-places scheme. The scheme then operates regardless of the school concerned. Is that what the Minister said—that the child who will benefit from the scheme is decided not by the individual school, but by the Secretary of State ultimately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite like that. The scheme assists the parents rather than the school. In other words, the funding helps the parents to meet school fees. It does not go to the school, as at present under the block
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
grant aided system. We are saying that once a child receives an assisted place under the scheme, he is entitled to continue in that place. But, if the school were to close, or if anything else were to upset that, the scheme could continue for that child only if he obtained a place at another school. However, as long as he was able to take advantage of the scheme, the only event that could revoke it for that child and his parents would be an increase in the family income above the limit for an assisted place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure exactly what my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) meant. I know that there are differences of view and understanding. No doubt the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) could help us if he felt that that would be helpful. But I understand that, when we take power after the next election, we shall repeal this part of the Bill, including the schedule. Therefore, the clause will subsist only as long as the schedule subsists. Yet we are talking about revocation of the determination during the lifetime of the schedule; but that will be only for the lifetime of the Tory Government. When we take over, this part of the Bill and the schedule will be repealed, so that children will no longer have assisted places.<br><br>
I am not too worried about that. I am sick when I see Conservative Members shed crocodile tears and wail about the need to move kids from one school to another and about how it will disrupt their education, and so on. That is what the Minister said. However, when they are given the opportunity, those hon Members move children willy-nilly from one school to another. Indeed, they allow their constituents' children to be moved into the private sector without any worry about disruption of education. It has been traditional for kids to enter private and grant-aided schools at times other than the normal transfer point from primary to secondary school. Therefore, I do not know what the Minister is worried about.<br><br>
Thankfully, there have also been schools that have closed down in the private sector, including one which the Solicitor-General for Scotland attended. Melville college closed down or merged—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably semantics, but the kids' education was totally disrupted. They moved to a different building and a different environment, and with all the alleged disruption to their education that worries the Minister. Then he uses the dreadful term—and we are supposed to worry—about these pupils being left "high and dry". What does it mean in practice? It means that they will have to go to their local authority school. I submit that it would do them a lot of good, and that they should have gone there in the first place. We shall certainly encourage them to go there in the first place.<br><br>
As my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigtown (Mr. Millan) has said, we issue a warning that parents should realise that as soon as the Opposition take power this part of the Bill will be repealed and the assisted places scheme will come to an end. The children will then be encouraged to go to their local schools. [Interruption.]<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) can shout about the people in Ayrshire, but they will not benefit from the scheme because there are no schools in Ayrshire under the assisted places scheme, unless, as is being suggested, some children are to be encouraged, in order allegedly to get a better education, to travel hours by train day in day out, week in week out from places such as Ayrshire. Otherwise, as I have said on a number of occasions, the taxpayer and ratepayer in Ayrshire will be subsidising the privileged and snob education of the Edinburgh bourgeoisie —the people whom the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) represents. He sees the parents regularly in the drawing rooms of North Edinburgh, the New Club and all the other haunts so familiar to the hon Member.<br><br>
I do not think that my hon Friend should worry about this, because my understanding is that when we repeal this part of the Bill, paragraph 6 of the schedule will go and the determinations will be revoked automatically—I am open to correction—and the pupils will go to their local schools and benefit greatly as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was a probing amendment. The Minister has reiterated the usual points about leaving pupils high and dry. It is our clear intention, when we return to power, to dismantle the scheme and to leave pupils high and dry. We make no bones about it. The effect of the dismantling of the scheme will be that pupils' education will be interrupted, and if parents wish to participate in the scheme, and gamble with the continuity of their children's education, they can do so.<br><br>
We also note from the Minister's reply that provisions will be made within the scheme for pupils to take their entitlement under the scheme to any other participating school should a particular institution have its determination revoked. We were not clear about that, so to that extent the probe has been successful. We shall not, therefore, push the amendment to a vote.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the schedule is to make it more difficult for the Labour Government, after we win the next general election, to terminate the assisted-places scheme. So the Tory drafters of the legislation—or the draftsmen who are the servants of this discredited Government—have added schedule 4, which is about the revocation of determinations. The purpose of the schedule is clearly to make it more difficult for determinations to be revoked.<br><br>
Revocation is probably very unlikely under the present Secretary of State, but an incoming Labour Secretary of State, after the next general election, will of course be interested not simply in revocation but in the complete repeal of clause 5 and of schedule 4 to this tawdry little Bill. I am sure that that will be one of our first priorities. It will not be done merely in the first Session of the next Parliament; it will be done early in that Session.<br><br>
We will not be motivated by vengeance, envy or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 639</span>
hatred. We will be motivated purely by educational considerations. Not once during the whole debate on clause 5 and schedule 4 have the Government produced any educational justification, any moral justification or any financial justification for the clause and the schedule, at a time when the local education authorities' schools are being starved of public funds and the children in those schools are having to bear the brunt of the failure of this discredited Government's policies, which have failed the nation, failed education, failed parents and failed the children in our schools.<br><br>
I agree with my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) that it is only fair to put our cards on the table and tell parents now what we plan to do. The mistake we made the last time was that instead of terminating the previous system of grant aid to the fee-paying schools we decided to phase it out gradually over five years. In retrospect, some of the Ministers in that previous Administration now agree that that was a mistake and that we should have acted quickly. I am sure that after the next general election we will act much more quickly.<br><br>
It is only fair to tell parents now that they should have nothing at all to do with the scheme. If parents are thinking of sending a child into the first year of secondary school under the scheme, it is only fair that we should tell them now that in the interests of the long-term continuity of their children's education they ought to have nothing to do with the scheme. If a child starts in the first year of a secondary school under the scheme, there is no guarantee that he will be able to finish six years of secondaiy schooling under the scheme, because after the next general election the next Labour Government will have as one of their top priorities not just the revocation of determinations, as mentioned in the schedule, but the repeal of this whole part of the legislation.<br><br>
The Bill has been described as a parents' charter. It is nothing of the kind. It is a charter for privilege. I am sure that one of the top educational priorities of the next Labour Government will be the abolition of privilege from our education system once and for all. I hope that we shall set about it with as much ruthless determination as this Government have shown in bolstering it up.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has now reached the end of its discussion of the assisted-places scheme. We have known from the start of the hostility of Opposition Members to the scheme. Knowing their dogma, as one has to in this job, I am not surprised about that. But I believe that they would be better able to advise their constituents on these matters if they took the time to understand the scheme, in particular the reason why the Government decided to make a radical change from the block-grant system, which has operated in Scotland for many years under both Labour and Conservative Governments.<br><br>
It was difficult to justify school A receiving grant aid and school B not receiving it. It seemed that the Government's proper objective in revising the scheme should be first to open it up so that it involved more schools and therefore more places for children throughout Scotland, and secondly to ensure that the receipt of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 640</span>
public funds—which, as I said, have been available for many years—was means-tested. Receipt of those funds should depend upon a family's income and not an accident of history which has bestowed funding upon an individual school for no apparent reason.<br><br>
We have been able to produce a scheme which we believe is much fairer, because it is related to family income, and is much more widespread, because 85 per cent, of the population live within 25 miles of a school offering assisted places. Opposition Members may snigger, but it is a tremendous improvement on the old block-grant system which persisted for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is misleading the Committee if he is trying to give the impression that the assisted-places scheme is simply a diversion of money already available in the form of grant aid, which was given by previous Tory and Labour Administrations. The previous Labour Administration were in the process of phasing out the old grant-aid system. One of the first things that the Minister did when he took office was to increase the amount of grant aid from about £900,000 a year to about £3½ million a year at present. In other words, he has almost quadrupled the amount of grant aid, and he will initially use that money for the assisted-places scheme, but there is no guarantee in future that the amount will continue to increase. Millions of pounds of public money will be used to line the pockets of the old boys in these schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon Gentleman, but he has learnt no more manners from the polite Chinese than he would have anywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I take exception to that racialist remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon Gentleman considers my description of the Chinese as polite to be a racialist remark.<br><br>
I admit that the previous Government were running down the scheme, but for many years of Labour Governments—too many—since the Second World War they supported the block grant system. As usual for the Labour Party, it has suggested no constructive alternative. It just wants to abolish. In this case, rather than abolish the scheme—because we believe that these schools should be open to pupils regardless of their parents' incomes—we have brought in a scheme to give a much better spread of the funds that have been provided over the years by Governments of both parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I cannot give way to frivolous interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister know that it is frivolous?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to know what the hon Gentleman intends to say to know that it will be frivolous.<br><br>
The question of inspection of schools has already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 641</span>
been well covered by the Opposition. They need have no fear that the inspection of schools in the independent sector is any less severe or well carried out than the inspection of schools in the public sector. Her Majesty's Inspectorate is most anxious to ensure that its stamp of approval will be unquestioned as a mark of the ability of a school to look after and educate children. If it were any other way in either the public or the State sector, I am sure that the inspectors would wish to know why. Therefore, there is no reason for the suggestion that there are double standards. Her Majesty's Inspectorate in Scotland approves a school only if it is completely satisfied about a school's ability to carry out its functions.<br><br>
The Opposition should ask parents rather then tell them what they should think of the scheme. The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and his colleagues were, as usual, most anxious to give parents their views. They are not sympathetic to the idea that they might listen to the views expressed by their constituents about the scheme. Parents can decide themselves about the scheme's benefits. There is no reason why the Opposition should be afraid of allowing their constituents to make up their own minds about such schemes. It is much more satisfactory if people are allowed to make their own choices. That is the purpose of this scheme, and I recommend it to the Opposition on that ground alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think of one constituent of mine who has expressed any interest in this crazy assisted-places scheme. I am sure that many of my hon Friends could say likewise. I am also sure that some Conservative hon Members could say that. To imagine that there is massive support among parents for this rubbish, the Minister must have a strange idea about the priorities of Scottish parents, most of whom are quite happy for their children to attend local education authority schools. I want nothing at all to do with this tawdry scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's constituents will be in no doubt about his opinion on any matter whatsoever. He seeks publicity at every opportunity. He competes with the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) for the title "Dial a quote". That fact should worry the hon Member for South Ayrshire. The result of the dogmatism and the widely-publicised views expressed by the hon Member for West Stirlingshire is that his constituents seek advice elsewhere, from other hon Members when they want to know something about such a scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan:</span><span class='membercontribution'> Name one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman challenges me to name a constituent. It is already on the record that I said that one of his constituents wrote to me about the hon Gentleman's attitude to football and his disgraceful behaviour during an international game at Wembley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It is a recognised custom in the House that when constituents write to an hon Member about a problem the letter is normally passed on to the hon Member for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
constituency concerned. In this case I asked the Minister after the Committee sat two weeks ago about the writer to whom he referred. He assured me that it was an anonymous letter, but signed "a West Stirlingshire constituent". I doubt whether—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The customs and practices of the House come under the ruling of Mr. Speaker, not under my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has to be said that quite a number of the hon Gentleman's constituents live in such fear and dread of expressing their own free opinions in West Stirlingshire that they have to write anonymous letters to hon Members in Parliament to let their views be known.<br><br>
We believe that clause 5 and its associated schedule are a great advance towards choice of education in Scotland. I warmly commend the schedule to my hon Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition oppose the schedule. I repeat that we have no sympathy with the scheme, which does not stand up to examination on education grounds. The sector of the education system that it seeks to prop up has been discredited by most educationalists, and those who support it are only the few who advocate its continued existence because of its ability to maintain social privilege. The number who will be admitted to those schools from other social and economic groupings —those who are allowed to enter by tradition—will be so small that it will make no impression and will scarcely salve the conscience of Ministers.<br><br>
If the assisted places scheme did not exist, the Minister would have to defend private-sector schools against the class privilege that they represent. We have heard no great call from our constituents to participate in the scheme, and I say that as a Member who has in his constituency the Dollar academy, which will receive about £40,000 under the scheme. Yet none of my constituents have approached me, even though I hold regular surgeries in Dollar to inquire about the operation of the scheme. That is not because of the frivolous, so-called argument put forward by the Minister—that they are somehow frightened by a moderate and mild person such as my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who is sympathetic and the very acme of humility.<br><br>
Therefore, it is true to say that people are showing no interest in the scheme. That is a testament to the provision made in the local authority sector. Even before the parents' charter, there was sufficient flexibility in most parts of the Scottish State system to allow the majority of parents to choose the sort of education that they wanted for their children.<br><br>
There are misgivings about the sort of schools that are being included in, and are supported by, the scheme. The single-sex schools are now regarded as out of date. However, some of them are now co-educational, for economic rather than educational reasons, and criticism is not as strong as it once was. Even so, many private schools in Scotland retain the single-sex system, which I believe creates far more problems than it resolves in relation to available educational facilities.<br><br>
The advantages of integrating children from relatively modest homes with the boarding school arrangements
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
—the Minister has admitted that that may come about as a result of the scheme—are dubious. Tearing children away from their families at an early stage of adolescence can cause many problems. Again, we find those difficult to justify on educational grounds.<br><br>
Private-sector day schools simply provide a form of education which, under any sort of scrutiny, does not necessarily result in higher academic achievement from those who are capable of benefitting from it. Furthermore, they do not provide a fuller or better education as regards providing children with the wherewithal to take on the world—a very difficult world at present.<br><br>
This scheme relates to an education system that is fast dying, there are now fewer schools of this sort available, and, even allowing for the massive Government injection of State funds, the system will continue to be in economic and financial difficulties. For those and many other reasons, we feel that the regulations embodied in schedule 4 in respect of the revocation of determinations for the purposes of the scheme should be opposed. The revocation does not go far enough. We want it to take place before the scheme begins,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
because we do not like the scheme, we do not want it, and we are pledged to have it completely dismantled at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>
When that happens, the children will be assigned to whatever schools their parents wish within the local authority system where they are in residence. We will not see the continuation of such a scheme, which will provide subsidies, hidden or otherwise, for those who have for far too long enjoyed the so-called benefits of privileged education.</span></p>
