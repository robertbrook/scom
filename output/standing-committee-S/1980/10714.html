	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of the Recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Local Government in Scotland (the Stodart Committee).</p></blockquote>
I am grateful for the opportunity to enable members of the Committee to give their views on the conclusions that I announced on the Stodart report. My statement on 17 June spelt out the Government's reaction to the report. The committee made 72 recommendations and, as I announced on that day, we have managed to accept no fewer than 60 of them. The committee gave special attention to those areas of local government where there is concurrency of function between regions and districts. Twelve such areas were identified, but when our reactions to the report take effect only three of the 12 will remain and only one concurrent function— that relating to community centres—will be completely untouched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to allow the maximum time for Back Benchers to contribute to the debate, I do not propose to go through all the recommendations. I propose to concentrate on two main topics which are the subject of important parts of the report—industrial development and tourism. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will be glad to pick up any other matters that may be raised if he catches your eye towards the end of the debate, Mr. Henderson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like at the outset to express again the Government's gratitude to Lord Stodart of Leaston and his committee for the comprehensive and constructive report that they produced within such a tight timetable, and, indeed, for the many helpful comments submitted by. local authorities and other bodies since the publication of the report, which have been immensely helpful to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention that our proposals should be implemented as soon as practicable. That is essential if, as has been frequently stated, the period of uncertainty for local government is to be kept to a minimum. Some of our proposals can be given effect administratively; others will require primary legislation. But it is our aim that the necessary Bill will
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
reach the statute book in time to allow the new arrangements to operate from 1 April 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to industrial development. It is important to get clear from the start what we do not propose to change the specific powers and responsibilities of local authorities to provide sites, factories, mortgages and other financial support for industrial development within their areas. Those represent very worthwhile functions of which district councils as well as regional councils can and have made good and proper use. Districts have their contribution to make, and we have rejected the Stodart majority recommendation that powers to assist industry should be confined to regional councils. On past experience, we need not fear that any problems will stem from the fact that regions and districts discharge these responsibilities concurrently, although it is clearly right that local authorities in the same area should seek to co-ordinate their activities as far as possible to avoid the possibility of duplicated effort or overprovision of factories, and to ensure provision of supporting infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it right to pay tribute to the way in which many of the district authorities have used those powers to help launch initiatives designed to generate employment opportunities in their areas. Some local authorities have, with presence of mind and imagination, devised constructive responses to the problems of unemployment, not only individually but in collaboration with each other and, indeed, with other organisations and private sector industry. Good examples of the invaluable support that local authorities can bring are found in North Ayrshire, Clydebank and Leith, to mention only three examples. As a result of the Stodart committee's report, we are now trying to introduce greater order into industrial promotion efforts, to make them more effective, and to get the maximum benefit from the central role of the new Locate in Scotland unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industrial promotion is a very serious business today as the competition for industrial projects— particularly mobile projects from overseas—becomes more intense. We seek to ensure that Scotland as a whole enjoys the maximum advantages of an effective and properly co-ordinated selling effort. The first step has been to respond positively to the report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on inward investment. What we propose now, in the wake of the Stodart report, could be best described as the next logical step to that. We wish to ensure that, in undertaking promotional activity overseas, regional councils will operate in closest consultation with the Locate in Scotland unit and the new town corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to become involved in the details of every individual visit abroad, and intend to seek a power to enable me to issue general consents for particular classes of promotional activity. That will reduce the need for authorities having to seek my approval for individual visits. I have it in mind, in accordance with the Stodart committee's suggestion, to issue guidance in a statutory code of practice on the role and interrelation of bodies working in this important area. Regional councils undertaking overseas promotional activities in accordance with such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
a code of practice—participating in LIS-sponsored activities—would not, therefore, require my prior specific consent. However, I should want to examine carefully the need for visits abroad which were not covered by the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to concentrate promotion on the regions, but that does not mean that the districts would have no part whatever in industrial promotion. We foresee that the districts might be invited by LIS and regional councils on appropriate occasions to be an integral part of an overseas selling mission. Under such arrangements, districts would be able to incur expenditure on such missions at the invitation of the organisers. However, we hope that the districts will concentrate mainly on the important and substantial functions of providing the accommodation and the related services which are such a valuable part of local responses to local problems. Their powers form an important part of the armoury for job generation. We see no role for independent district promotional effort outside their areas, but we recognise that there will be a need for districts to advertise the availability of specific factory premises throughout the United Kingdom, in the course of their normal property management activities. The legislation would allow for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislative changes which the Government have in mind relate first and foremost to industrial promotion. Ultimately, we are aiming at good sense and a balanced approach to industrial promotion, coordinated on the lines that I have explained. Our proposals recognise the valuable work which local authorities have done in industrial development, and the creation of employment opportunities in conjunction with the Scottish Development Agency and central Government. I do not wish to stop regional authorities doing promotional work abroad, or to stifle their initiative, but I shall seek co-ordination. It does no one any good if Scottish regions take no account of what others are doing in undertaking overseas visits. Therefore, my control will not normally stop regions doing overseas promotion but help them by ensuring that they get the greatest benefit from that for themselves and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has spoken about co-operation and co-ordination between regions and districts. However, he will be aware, I am sure, that in the city of Aberdeen—where unemployment has increased by 50 per cent, in the past 12 months—the district council is so dissatisfied with its arrangements with the North East of Scotland Development Authority that recently it set up its own development authority. Is the Secretary of State closing the door entirely to district authorities being involved in promotion work abroad?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to explain how I feel that district authorities should fit in. I do not believe that such authorities should be precluded from involvement in overseas activities as part of a regional effort or a joint mission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only as part of a joint mission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only as part of a joint mission. I believe that the appearance of so many individual district representatives overseas merely creates confusion. Certainly, the greatest possible benefit cannot be obtained from such an arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not require individual regional authorities to submit proposals for approval to me, provided that they adhere to the proposed code of practice, and I reject suggestions that we are unreasonably restricting local discretion. I hope that hon. Members will accept that the proposals are in the best interest of securing maximum investment and employment throughout Scotland. That, I am sure, must be our shared objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism is another area where I generally agree with the report's recommendations; in fact only in one respect am I unwilling to implement them. Tourism is of vital importance to the Scottish economy, and we have been steadfast in our policy of maintaining Government support for the industry which provides so much employment. It is important, however, that the industry should be in the proper shape to tackle ever-increasing international competition, and I am confident that the steps we shall take to provide a more effective link between the public sector bodies and the trade will allow the industry to surmount those challenges and move on to a new prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's views on the committee's recommendation that the Scottish Tourist Board should have independent powers for the promotion overseas of Scotland as a tourist destination have already been made known to the House. We consider that there would be wasteful duplication of effort if the Scottish Tourist Board were to have such powers. Inevitably the English and Wales tourist boards would also seek to promote abroad. We would then have each of the national tourist boards in competition overseas with one another and with the British Tourist Authority, which is of course the body responsible at present for overseas promotion of all of Great Britain. Such a system could never become as cost-effective as the present arrangements. Here again, duplication is the enemy of success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish tourist industry seems at present to be in a state of collapse. The right hon. Gentleman's comments about moving on to greater prosperity do not exactly ring true in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the British Tourist Authority is incapable of servicing the Scottish tourist industry and ensuring its growth, is it not desirable that powers should be given to the Scottish Tourist Board to do the work which the British authority is obviously unable to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept either of the hon. Gentleman's premises. I shall proceed to explain how I believe that the system should work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To refuse to implement the committee's recommendation is not the same as accepting that the status quo is satisfactory. I have discussed the matter at length with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade, and we have taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the matter to the Scottish Tourist Board and the British Tourist Authority respectively. As a consequence, there is total agreement that a new director of overseas tourism post should be created at the Scottish Tourist Board. The director will have responsibility for liaising with the various tourism interests in Scotland—within an organisational structure which I shall come to shortly—and with the British Tourist Authority, to agree the priorities for inclusion in the Scottish component of the British Tourist Authority's overseas programme. I am confident that that will prove a positive and beneficial development, and I am heartened by the attitude of co-operation with the new approach which is evident on all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to introduce legislation to bring the committee's other recommendations on tourism into effect. Although that will mean that district councils alone will have responsibility for tourism promotion, I believe that it is important for regions to retain powers to contribute to tourism projects. The scope for regional authority interest in infrastructure and other aspects must also be maintained. I am convinced that it is in the industry's best interests for tourism functions to be concentrated at district level and for district councils—with their special grasp of local conditions—to participate directly in an area tourist organisation network covering all areas of Scotland and under the co-ordination and leadership of the Scottish Tourist Board. Such a network operates most successfully in the Highlands and Islands at present, with the encouragement and participation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, and I see no need for change in those arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, although we are talking about a revision of local authority functions, it will be clear to all that the Government are taking this opportunity to respond to the requests, which interested parties have been making for some time now, to introduce a radical adjustment to the organisation of tourism sponsorship in Scotland. Not only will this new organisation provide greater prospects for successful co-operation amongst all those involved, and a more clearly defined role for the Scottish Tourist Board—whose preparation for this challenge I am pleased to acknowledge—but, of greater importance, it will pass the lion's share of the decision-making powers to the trade itself. This is entirely appropriate, as it is the trade which, in the final analysis, faces the consequences of these decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that under the leadership of the Scottish Tourist Board all the parties concerned will see for themselves the advantages of the area tourist organisation system, and will co-operate together in deciding what organisational systems and collaborative arrangements they think are best suited for their own areas. The network of area tourist organisations will also be brought together nationally under the Scottish Tourist Board. I expect that in some areas the area tourist organisation will involve collective groupings of districts and in others there may be a division into more than one ATO within the same district. This will depend on the tourism characteristics and potential of each area. Among the first questions to be answered are what is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
appropriate combination for each area, and how is a consensus on that obtained amongst the various potential partners?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a system depends on co-operation and the effective participation of all the parties,and I am sure that this will be forthcoming. We must, however, be conscious of the possibility that a district council may be unwilling to enter a particular organisation or may have its own strongly-held views on the appropriate solution for its area. One way to overcome this problem would be to ask Parliament to provide me with reserve powers to require district councils to collaborate in the formation of particular area tourist organisations and to co-operate in the drawing up of schemes of tourist organisation within that area. I am reluctant to assume that such reserve powers are necessary, but it may be wise to seek them, since a system based entirely on co-operation might run into difficulty if even a very small number of authorities were unwilling to collaborate. I would certainly hope that such reserve powers would never have to be used, as district councils would recognise the value of the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is important that tourism promotion carried out abroad by a district council should conform to the broader strategy and priorities being formulated by the Scottish Tourist Board and the network of area tourist organisations. I intend that the district councils should continue to be able to exercise their tourist promotional powers overseas, but, to avoid conflict or dissipation of effort, they will be able to do so only with my consent. Again in practical terms I foresee no difficulty about this and expect that good sense and a spirit of co-operation will prevail in the interests of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals for tourism organisation, therefore, have been developed after careful consideration of Stodart's comments and recommendations, in the light of proposals put forward last year by COSLA, HIDB and STB, and taking into account public comment and criticism of current administrative arrangements. They represent a sensible and practical approach to ensuring that we are able in Scotland to make the most of our tourism potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the implementation of the Stodart report will be a useful tidying-up exercise after the first five years of our new system of local government. After having done this, I hope for the sake of everyone in local government that we can look forward to a period of stability, so that the system can settle down. We undertook in our manifesto to conduct this review. We have duly done so and I now look forward to hearing the views of anyone who wishes to give them, before I carry through as many of these changes as possible with the approval of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce Millan (Glasgow, Graigton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone here today has found anything that the Secretary of State said very exciting, and I should like to put the debate in a rather wider context. But I shall come to the specific points
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
arising from the Stodart committee report which the Secretary of State dealt with. Although we are grateful for some of the further details that he gave, we are not sure that he has exactly clarified some of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that there has been so little in the way of representations about the Stodart report since its publication. There have been virtually no representations from local authorities, or even individual letters. That is partly because some of the matters with which Stodart dealt are not particularly exciting. It is also because local authorities in Scotland are at present in a state of crisis and are preoccupied with financial problems to an extent that it is almost impossible for them to turn their minds to the problems of the Stodart committee report. I shall say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that questions of finance need necessarily bring about a crisis of relationships between central and local government in the way that has happened between the Government and Scottish local authorities, although local authority finance is an important and difficult subject, and no doubt some of my hon. Friends will have comments to make about it and its reform. The crisis has arisen basically because of the Government's attitude towards local government in their financial dealings with them over the past two years. Also, the way that the Government have dealt with disputes with local authorities has been calculated to bring about maximum prejudice against them when they do the work for which they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we deal with some of the services mentioned in Stodart, it is worth putting on record that the health of any community depends considerably on the competence of its local authority and the quality of services it provides. It does no good to community relations or to communal peace to refer to the recent riots in England—fortunately, none took place in Scotland—because it creates great prejudice against local authorities which have considerable responsibilities for providing services which help prevent outbreaks of communal disturbance. Whatever view we take of the root causes of these outbreaks, we cannot solve the problems without strong local authorities with adequate finance to deal with social problems. That is especially true of urban areas, but it also applies to rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who considers the conditions in our cities especially will see a gradual deterioration in the physical environment. It is not only a problem of the past two years or so; there has been a gradual deterioration of the physical environment. Housing cuts especially will make that considerably worse. In many urban areas, an extremely unhealthy situation is building up, and the Government have contributed to that in many ways by economic policies and by their general attitude towards local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has therefore to be set in the general context of difficulties with local government finance and of whether there should be a reform of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
local authority financial system. I shall say something about that which will not perhaps make me popular with some of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that some criticisms of the rating system are justified. There is no perfect system of local government finance, and we would be fooling ourselves if we said that we believed that we could get a perfect system. In my opinion, much more depends on the general relationship between central and local government than on the way in which local authority revenues are raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Layfield came out in favour of a local income tax, and I see considerable advantages in that. But, even with that, the rating system will continue to play a major part in local government finance for many years to come. I say that despite the fact that this Government have promised a consultative paper about local government finance in the autumn. I may say now, before that paper is published, that I am extremely sceptical whether it will produce an acceptable solution to the problems of local government finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remember the previous promises of this Government—for example, on the abolition of domestic rates. It is both ironic and tragic to observe what has actually happened on domestic rates. By courtesy of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), some figures were published the other day. They showed that domestic ratepayers in 1978-79 paid £192 million, by 1980-81— only two years later—they were paying £309 million, and in the current year they will pay more than £400 million. That means that the rates will have more than doubled under the present Administration in three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about financial and other crises in local government. Local government will not be able to survive if increases such as I have mentioned continue. Yet there is every sign that such increases will continue, if present Government policies go on putting local authorities in an impossible financial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that local government finance must, in any case, be considered in the context of devolution. That is a factor that weighed heavily with the last Labour Government. If that is true of local government finance, it is also true of major reform of the local authority system in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, for a variety of reasons, that this is a sensible time to talk about major reform of local government structure in Scoland—partly because the system is still setding down after the reform of 1975 and also because, in the kind of financial crisis that local government faces at present, uncertainty about an early major reform of local government would only make matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Stodart report dealt at least incidentally with some of the problems of major reform. I shall come shortly to what it said. However, I wish to put on record my own views on what happened about the Wheatley committee report. It seemed to me when it was published that there was too much emphasis on regional planning in the Wheatley report and an attempt to put local government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
into a structure that satisfied certain optimistic expectations about the possibility of regional planning. The Committee will remember the talk about the estuarial principle, and so on. That was why Wheatley recommended the system that he did, which is basically the system we have now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I do not join those who criticise the inadequacy of local government in any significant way, or say that the two-tier system has been a failure— I do not believe that that is so—I have, nevertheless, much sympathy with some of the criticisms of the present system of local government. If we were to reform it—again, this must be seen in the context of devolution—we should certainly have to see whether we should have a one-tier system instead of a two-tier system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the problems of concurrent functions that were dealt with by Stodart, there are wider issues arising from the links between the services—housing and social work, for example— which are difficult to solve while we have a two-tier system of local government. While, unfortunately, in some areas, there is disagreement between the regional authority and the district authority, and for that matter a good deal of jealousy, there is also considerable confusion in the public's mind about the respective functions of districts and regions. I have, therefore, a good deal of sympathy with the critics who say that it might have been better if we had ended with a one-tier system rather than a two-tier system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, these are wider issues, and it would not be sensible for any Government to tackle them at present. But on the issue of the single tier, I have particular sympathy for the four cities, although not exclusively for them, when one considers the population figures which are set out on page 92 of the Stodart report. One can appreciate why a district council such as Glasgow finds it difficult to understand that, with a population of nearly 800,000, it should have a restricted set of functions, whereas a region such as the Borders, with a population of fewer than 100,000, should deal with the major functions such as education and social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a perfectly understandable criticism that areas such as Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee and so on make about the present system. I had sympathy for that view at the time of the Wheatley report and the 1973 Act, and I still have it, but now to make a change of the nature that, say, Glasgow would want would be a major reform of local government with complications and implications for the system. Whatever the merits of the matter, I do not believe that the problem can be tackled at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, other problems such as boundaries, and whether Argyll should be part of the Strathclyde region. As a ratepayer in Strathclyde, I should not worry whether Argyll was outside the Strathclyde region because I believe that in proportion to its size it is very well treated by the Strathclyde region at present. However, again these are matters which take us beyond the tidying up operation which Stodart was mostly connected with
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and for the reasons I expressed I believe that they have to be left for the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Stodart report basically becomes a tidying up operation. It is not to be criticised for that reason, and I do not do so. In fact, I believe that on most of the matters it dealt with it came to perfectly sensible and reasonable conclusions. There are one or two exceptions to that view which I shall mention shortly, but where it dealt with matters such as concurrent functions it seemed to me that it came to reasonable conclusions. Interestingly, when it came to decide whether a particular concurrent function should be exercised by the district or the region, in virtually each case it came down in favour of the district. On pages 94 and 95 of the Stodart report there is a list of items in respect of which the decision was that the matter should go to the districts. I believe that on most of those matters there is no difficulty of principle, although there may be some practical difficulties in making the transfers from the regions to the districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to three of the matters mentioned by the Secretary of State and, first, to industrial promotion. The Secretary of State made a statement today which we shall obviously want to consider, because I was not satisfied with his original statement in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went for the minority report of Stodart in regard to industry. With present levels of unemployment, it is impracticable and unreasonable to say that large district authorities such as Glasgow, Dundee or Aberdeen must be excluded from industrial promotion. Frankly, that is silly in the present circumstances and, therefore, there has to be a role for the districts. However, if we agree that there has to be a role for them, it is not possible to make the sort of distinction that I believe the Secretary of State is still making—it was made in the note of reservation and in the main report of Stodart—between, on the one hand, the provision of facilities and, on the other hand, promotion, since the two aspects go together. It is unreasonable to expect a district to be enthusiastic about providing facilities which represent a burden on the rates if it does not at the same time have a considerable say in promoting its own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Secretary of State's remarks this morning about districts perhaps being invited to take part in particular overseas missions and so on can be a solution to this problem. I agree with him about the need for co-ordination. It is not sensible for people to fall over one another in trying to encourage the same kind of investor to locate in different parts of Scotland. But I do not believe that the problem necessarily has to be solved by taking the sorts of legislative powers which the Secretary of State has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into this matter in detail, because I think that the Minister accepts my general point. However, I appeal to him to see whether agreement cannot be reached without taking legislative power and whether, through discussion with COSLA and the others and with the Locate in Scotland unit acting as an information centre about trips overseas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
and so on, co-ordination can take place and authorities can be prevented, in their own interest, from unreasonable or unprofitable actions. It is in the interest of a district or region to know whether the dates on which it may wish to make a particular trip are sensible in relation to the activities of other districts and regions and of the agencies of central Government. I believe that this can best be done by informal co-ordination rather than by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the same view about overseas trips. The Secretary of State went a long way this morning to make it clear that he does not want to interfere in ordinary overseas promotional trips. However, whether we like it or not, there is considerable prejudice in the press and elsewhere about overseas trips by councillors, who are constantly accused of junketing. Political capital is made out of that. The Secretary of State is deluding himself if he takes these powers and believes that he can be excluded from that sort of political controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the prejudice that is created against local councillors on these matters is absolutely appalling. I am not in favour of junketing but, equally, I am in favour of local councillors and officials having the opportunity to do sensible and reasonable things for their districts, even if that involves overseas journeying. Members of Parliament go on overseas trips from time to time for perfectly reputable and justifiable reasons. We should try to get away from this prejudice against local councillors which causes deep offence to many conscientious councillors and prevents many councils from effectively carrying out perfectly sensible duties. Therefore, I do not believe that the way in which the Secretary of State intends to deal with this matter is wholly satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with overseas trips for industrial promotion. But if the hon.

That is the sort of thing that brings local government into disrepute, and it was done by a Tory council and a Tory Lord Provost of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to leisure and recreation. I do not understand what the Secretary of State's statement in the House really meant and, again, I do not believe that one can have absolute tidiness in this area. For example, to say that leisure and recreation should be a district function does not deal with the problem of the community centres, which are basically owned by the regions at present. It does not do any good to say that it is basically a district function but that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
we will allow the regions to carry on using their community centres. Either it is a concurrent function or it is not, and it seems to me that the Secretary of State is here producing a continuation, in a slightly different form of concurrent functions. If that is what he is doing, it is probably the only reasonable way in which to deal with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, for example, the use of schools for leisure and recreation functions, and I see that the Stodart committee mentioned the 1967 circular which I know well—I was responsible for it. It encourages education authorities to allow schools to be used for recreation and leisure purposes in the evenings. I dare say that there have been umpteen circulars on the same lines since 1967, and I cannot say that we are as far forward as I should have liked as there is much resistance, but it demonstrates that on leisure and recreation it is no use saying that it should be either a distinct or a regional function. At the end of the day, it will be a function with which both the districts and the regions will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties of putting the emphasis on the district provision rather than on the regional provision lies in the naive belief that under that system the regions will be willing to contribute towards district expenditure. That belief could soon be exploded, I believe, by the reality of events, because, if one took away the function from either the districts or the regions, I do not think that it would be easy to get them to contribute towards its provision in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for tourism, I do not believe that what the Secretary of State said is satisfactory even from the point of view of district co-ordination. He seemed to suggest that a new set of quangos would be established and called area tourist organisations. As he explained how they would work, their effectiveness became less and less plausible—at least to me. Again, we shall have to look at the provisions that the Secretary of State disclosed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards overseas promotion, I remain of the view—that taken by the previous Labour Government and provided for in the Scotland Bill—that the Scottish Tourist Board should have a direct role in overseas promotion. That is the view of the board itself and the present chairman, as it was the view of the previous chairman. The British Tourist Authority is too centralist in its attitudes, and the present chairman of the British Tourist Authority is particularly centralist and London-oriented. I do not believe that we can break the present unsatisfactory position unless we give independent powers to the Scottish Tourist Board. That was my view when in Government, and it remains my view. The appointment of a director of overseas promotion at the Scottish Tourist Board does not meet the bill. It would be simpler and more effective to give the Scottish Tourist Board the powers that I know it wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on councillors' remuneration—a matter not mentioned by the Secretary of State—I agree with the Stodart committee's report that we ought to look into the possibility of a salary for councillors. I cannot say that the record of the previous Labour
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Government was any better than that of the present Government on this subject. I make no claim for the way in which the previous Labour Government dealt with local councillors. I believe that the oely satisfactory solution lies in going for some kind of salary. It is misleading to talk of it as a full-time salary. There are many areas where the councillors, particularly those in charge of major committees, are in fact full-time, and there is no satisfactory way to avoid that, but a salary need not be a full-time salary, and we should move to salary provision for councillors. It is a fault of both the previous Labour Government and the present Government that we have not been willing to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is part of the general prejudice against local authorities and local councillors that I have already mentioned. It is easy to criticise local councillors in the press and elsewhere—to make them seem incompetent, concerned only with their own ends, and to imply that they run extravagant organisations and are in local government only for the money. In my experience that is the exact reverse of the truth for the vast majority of local councillors, who do the job because they genuinely wish to provide a service to the community, which often involves them in considerable personal expense. That must be put on the record. Members of Parliament are often self-righteous about local councillors, yet they are only too willing to vote salary increases for themselves—like other hon. Members, I vote for such increases. It is high time that hon. Members, who have generally recognised the need for Members of Parliament to be paid adequately, recognised the need to recompense our local councillors properly for the considerable work that they do on behalf of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what I said at first: local government is in a state of crisis. Its morale is low because of what the Government have done over the past couple of years. The morale of individual councillors is lower than I have ever known it, partly because of the financial crises and partly because the Government have tried to create the maximum prejudice against local councils and councillors and tried to blame all our present ills on local authorities. In doing so, they have damaged local government and local councillors, whose basic interest is in providing a good service to their communities. The sooner we get away from confrontation and antagonism between central and local government and achieve consensus and co-operation instead, the healthier not only local government finance but local democracy will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members who have sat silently listening, albeit unwillingly, to debates affecting Scotland alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I welcome the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 17 June, and concur in congratulating Lord Stodart of Leaston and his committee on the speed with which the inquiry into local government in Scotland was carried out. It is a credit to the work of that committee that my right hon Friend has decided to accept 60 of its recommendations. I should like to think that even some of the 12 that he did not accept may receive his consideration later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with three of the recommendations that have been accepted—those on planning, industrial development and tourism. I declare a specific interest in the first of those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 38, in chapter 6 of the report, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" planning lies at the heart of any system of local government. From it flows development of every kind—housing, schools, parks, factories and all the associated infra-structural services. The legacy of effective planning is an environment conducive to both social and economic growth. Bad planning, on the other hand, can seriously mar the attractiveness of an area and deter expansion. So the importance of planning is immense."</p></blockquote>
For that reason I am concerned with the present planning organisation in district and regional authorities. There is often a period of many months between the submission of a planning application and its approval. There is also a conflict of interests between the district and the region about responsibility, which is frustrating to the developer. An escalation of costs often results from delays in planning offices. I am convinced that my right hon. Friend would have done better to look more closely at paragraph 44, on page 21 of the report, which favours a single planning authority. With the local authorities' powers of call-in of planning applications, it might have been better for my right hon. Friend to take the advice of the Scottish branch of the County Surveyors' Society, and accept paragraph 44. I should like my right hon. Friend to look at that matter, to see whether further consideration would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other, major criticism of the planning system is that it is integrated with the infrastructure services that were referred to in paragraph 78, on page 32 of the report. The Stodart committee report drew attention to the problems of sewerage and water. At present, the plans for sewerage and water on any development are prepared by the regional water services department. Developers—in many cases including district councils— are required to have those plans approved by the regional water services department before any development proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, there is considerable delay in regional offices, which causes disruption to the planned programme of the developer who is, of course, paying the regional council for the provision of those services. Why cannot the developers have the initial responsibility for installing water and sewerage in housing schemes, provided that those are up to the standards required by the local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those improvements were referred to in paragraphs 79 and 80 of the report, which my right hon. Friend would be justified in studying to decide
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
whether such improvements could be made to the present system, as the committee recommended. That would cut out delays and reduce costs to the developer and to local authorities, which would be able to reduce the number of staff now required to carry out that duplicated work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to industrial development, which was dealt with by recommendation 31, and is referred to in paragraph 116, on page 45, of the report. I draw the Committee's attention to the note of dissent on page 82 of the report, with particular reference to paragraph 2 of that note where it is stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>" to deprive district councils of their industrial powers would be a retrograde step."</p></blockquote>
Although I accept that the regions play a large part in industrial development, they also play an important part in the development of advance factories, particularly in the rural areas. In my constituency, the Banff and Buchan and the Gordon district councils have provided many jobs as the result of their initiative in providing small factories. I am glad that my right hon. Friend, while accepting recommendation 31, has also decided to continue to allow the districts powers to provide factories, or mortgages, concurrently with the regions. That is exactly what the note of dissent was intended to convey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I cannot wholly agree with my right hon. Friend's decision to require regions to obtain his approval before incurring expenditure on overseas deputations to secure inward investment. I am aware of his thoughts on the matter, and the need to ensure that the Locate in Scotland unit's operation is successful; but, I feel that organisations such as the North East of Scotland Development Authority, which is located in Grampian, will be severely restricted in its activities if such an imposition is placed upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that half a dozen authorities should not chase all over the world to secure inward investment, because that is what the Locate in Scotland unit has been set up to do. However, there will be occasions when an on-the-spot decision must be taken by the authority to send a deputation overseas, when there is a possibility of a new company being established in the region, due to work carried out earlier by officers of that authority. To cause delay by requiring that authority to seek the approval of the Secretary of State may mean the loss of that new company, unless my right hon. Friend can assure the Committee that he will take steps to ensure that there will be no delay in his office in dealing with an application to incur expenditure on an overseas trip in connection with inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to learn this morning that my right hon. Friend will issue guidelines on promotional tours, which will save the necessity of local authorities such as Grampian—with NESDA—making an individual application for each overseas promotional tour. I welcome that decision, and I am sure that it will be equally welcomed by other authorities which have worked so hard for inward investment in Scotland while in no way dissociating themselves
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
from the need to have the Locate in Scotland unit as the central service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to tourism. Recommendations 41 and 42 of the report refer to paragraphs 147, 151 and 153. It is not logical to devolve tourism to 53 district authorities. Admittedly the largest of those, the Strathclyde region, has not been as active as it could have been in the development of tourism. But other regions, especially Grampian and Tayside, have a very smooth operation which works effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Grampian, apart from Aberdeen city, there is no tourism structure. Do the proposals mean that in Grampian, for example, the four district councils will have to employ further specialised staff to deal with tourism? If we multiply that throughout Scotland, we are talking about hundreds of new staff at a time when we are endeavouring to secure a reduction of overmanning in local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot have gone unnoticed by my right hon. Friend that British Rail, the British Airports Authority, the National Trust for Scotland, COSLA and even the Scottish Tourist Board all came out in favour of the regions being responsible for tourism. If it is in order for the HIDB to be responsible for tourism, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that the regions should retain responsibility for one of the main growth industries in Scotland, which they have operated satisfactorily since the reorganisation of local government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend to re-examine his decision on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) made a brief and slighting reference at the beginning of his remarks about tourism to the Strathclyde region. He suggested that it did not seem interested in, or have much of a record in, the promotion of tourism. But surely that is doing a grave disservice to those in the region who take very seriously their responsibilities for promoting an area of the country which perhaps in the past has not received the attention that it should have with regard to tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such people have made significant promotional efforts in parts of the countryside. I should like to mention the Clyde valley—although there may be no obvious reasons to members of the Committee in my doing so—in that respect. I should hate something to appear in the record in the name of that fine gentleman, the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Members wish to dissent from that, they should examine the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend to re-examine his decision on the matter, as I think that the transfer of tourism to the district authorities at this critical stage in attracting tourists to Scotland would be a retrograde step, when the present system operated by the regions is geared to increased promotional activity in the United Kingdom and overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I should have liked to develop different sections of the report, I wish to give other hon. Members the opportunity of contributing to the debate. I hope that this very fine report Will be the forerunner of more in the future, with a view to improving the whole structure of local government in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I wish to continue where my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craig-ton (Mr. Millan) left off—that is, on councillors' salaries. My right hon. Friend put forward a very strong case for putting councillors on salary. I disagree with him, for this good reason. I was a councillor myself for many years, and I know the trials, tribulations and economic circumstances facing many councillors during my time and even at the present time. There is a great deal of disgruntlement, and the local councillors' morale is at a very low ebb at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a referendum of councillors throughout Scotland, they would come out heavily in favour of increased allowances as against a salary. Even at this time, some lads are in reasonable jobs, and they could get a seat, which would rebound against them. Consequently they are not prepared to take that gamble in local government. That is a very good reason why we should consider these matters closely and at the same time stick rigidly to the daily allowance, which must be increased substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the industrial situation, because to a great extent I agree with the Secretary of State for Scotland. I do not think that he has grasped the nettle this morning, because he is talking about the regions being, as it were, engaged in a promotional exercise. Unless district councils play an equal part with the regions, we shall not find the correct solution to this serious problem. To take my own constituency as a guide, it contains four district councils—Glasgow, Monklands, Hamilton and Motherwell. All of them without exception are vying with each other and fighting each other to bring industry to their districts. That is a dissipation not only of energy but of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see each regional council, with representation from all its district councils, able to sit down at the end of the day and come to conclusions which will benefit the region as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I have in mind especially the industrial belt of Strath-clyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the Stodart report also referred to taxis. The problem of taxis has been a long-standing, running sore in my constituency and also, I am sure, in those of many of my hon. Friends and many Conservative Members. At present, the ludicrous situation exists that taxis are licensed by the Hamilton district council, but when they move into the Motherwell district council they cannot pick up passengers because they are not licensed by that council. There is a possibility that, with an overall view, the region could resolve that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many of my colleagues want to participate in this debate. I wanted to emphasise the issues of salary and industry, although we could go right through the report. My main criticism of the report is that it is not positive in its solutions to many of the problems. The Secretary of State for Scotland this morning also was not positive. We must have a positive approach and full discussion. But unless at the outset, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigtcn correctly stated, we can deal effectively with the financial situation, which is the basis of good local government, all our discussions and conclusions will be to no avail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I find much of interest and value in it, and I welcome the fact that my right hon. Friend has endorsed so much of it this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on one aspect of it which I find particularly disappointing—the question of the all-purpose or most-purpose authority status in general, and in particular that for the city of Edinburgh. I do not say in any accusatory sense that I find it disappointing, because I do not believe that the Committee's findings were those that it might have reached had it had a broader remit. But its remit was drawn in such a way that it could not come to any other conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under that remit, any recommendation that the Committee made about all-purpose of most-purpose authorities had to be
	<br><blockquote><p>" consistent with fully maintaining the viability of the existing authorities ".</p></blockquote>
That definition hamstrung the committee from the beginning and, in a sense, created a situation that was not unlike asking a cook to make the best omlette possible without breaking any eggs. In effect— reading between the lines the frustration of the committee is evident for all to see—it made it impossible for the committee to take a proper look at the status, capability and requirements of cities such as Edinburgh. Indeed, it prejudged the position which the committee ultimately came to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the remit is understandable from the Government's view on the philosphy of " anythng for a quiet life ", but to the people of Edinburgh it is unacceptable. I shall come later to the reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I shall comment, first, on the report and the points that it makes in justification. Paragraph 26 largely accepts the regional assertion that separate city authorities would mean increases in staff. To receive that kind of evidence from Lothian region at present is rich indeed! I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister realises that. Given that, can my hon. Friend tell the Committee what happened to the much-vaunted staff savings that were to come in 1975 at the time of the original reorganisation? There was no reduction, there was a proliferation. We did not see the efficiency that we were told we would see; we saw empire building. Above all, we saw duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh district and Lothian region are both now involved in planning, lighting and hygiene, and work together with their separate staffs in such areas as industrial development, tourism, recreation, museums and a whole series of other things. There is the ridiculous situation between the two authorities where each owns a theatre in competition with the other, both subsidised out of ratepayers' money. I find it hard to believe, despite what the report says, that all this could not be rationalised and savings made if one authority was set up in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same paragraph, the committee admits that it was unable to consider alternative arrangements. I know that the district council in Edinburgh suggested rearranging the areas of Lothian outwith the city, along with the Borders and Central regions. My view is that that might easily be possible, but the committee was unable to consider it because it was outwith its remit. It is arguable that, had the committee been able to consider it, it would have seen a greater communion of interest between the areas of Lothian outside the city and the Borders and Central regions than is ever likely to be the case between the outlying areas of Lothian and the city of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, one thing would have been missing— namely, the ratepayers of Edinburgh, who are, by and large, the support of the region outside the city. Certainly, the proportion of rate poundage raised in Edinburgh greatly outweighs the percentage that is returned to it in expenditure from the region.

One of Edinburgh's real grievances is with the Lothian regional council. The ratepayers of Edinburgh are fed up with being both paymaster and whipping boy. I, therefore, raised with the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) the question of using ratepayers' money to bring councillors back from holiday to vote against the interests of the ratepayers. He may think that it is similar to the incident when the Lord Provost went out on the city's business to give a party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is an essential difference, and I hope— although he is not here at present—that he will recognise that. The difference is that hon. Members, if they were on holiday and had to come back for business, would have to pay for themselves— quite rightly. The ratepayers of Edinburgh feel aggrieved that their money is being spent on bringing back fawning councillors to vote against their real interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I now turn again to the report. Paragraph 27 makes the rather srange claim that, in any event, whatever the local government structure, Edinburgh is known throughout the world as Scotland's capital. That may be claimable at the moment, it may even be claimable by tradition, but, under the present dispensation, how much longer is that likely to be the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh is no longer a city. It is a district. It has a leader who is called Provost only by legal courtesy and not by traditional right. Few other countries would treat their capitals in that way. Even the city of London still retains its status and, indeed, its Lord Mayor. My belief, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, is that what is good enough for England and London is good enough for Scotland and Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) smiling. Perhaps what I am talking about is cosmetics but, in the fullness of time, such things are important, because they lead to the sense and spirit of community which is so vital if a city such as Edinburgh is to be kept together in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, these are not my main reasons for disagreeing with the report and with the Stodart committee's remit. I seek an all-purpose authority for Edinburgh for much stronger reasons. In a way, my basic reason concerns the survival of the city itself. I do not dramatise. ' We have before us in Glasgow, with its empty, devastated city centre, an example of what can happen. Perhaps the hon. Member for Garscadden would like to look at the latest census reports, which show that, in the last decade, Glasgow has lost 22 per cent, of its population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, Opposition Members who represent seats in Glasgow, and who are juggling around trying to find a seat for the next election because of the reduced number appearing in the provisional recommendations of the Boundary Commission, should know well what I am talking about. Edinburgh, in the same period, lost over 40,000 people, according to the preliminary census report. I know that in practice because there are areas in my constituency which were residential and essential to the basis and centre of the city but from which the people have now gone. The dwellings there are now betsitters or temporary accommodation, which may be useful but which do nothing in the long term for the stability of the community or the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change has occurred because, under the present structure of regional government, where outlying areas dominate the region and, in that sense, dominate Edinburgh as well, the amenities and the bulk of the expenditure and new developments are moving constantly away from Edinburgh and into those areas, and the people, not unnaturally, are following them. We have seen that in the growth of Livingston new town, for example. As the people follow, so further expenditure, further amenities and further development have to go out to look after the people who have gone from the city.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The Stodart report described the regions as
	<br><blockquote><p>" single workable and cohesive units ".</p></blockquote>
In the case of the Lothian region—I say this in all seriousness to my hon. Friend—it is the cohesiveness of a vicious circle that is dependent on the centrifugal force which drives people and resources ever outwards from the centre. The Government must make up their mind whether that is what they wish to see while there is still time to rectify the situation if they decide that it is not. Wheatley saw the cities as centres. I doubt whether he ever saw those centres being milked and drained, as Edinburgh is today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh could be an all-purpose authority. The Stodart report accepts that in paragraph 26. If it were, there can be little doubt, looking at the present region, that Edinburgh would be better off. How many of the worries about schools and other provisions that we now face would be mitigated with an Edinburgh that had a chance to rationalise its own administration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stodart speaks of the city as the focus of the region. That focus is in danger of becoming blurred. It was ever the fear at the time of reorganisation that, far from being a true centre, Edinburgh would become a sort of carcase from which the rest of the region would feed. That fear slowly and inexorably is beginning to be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a local Member of Parliament, naturally I argue for my city, but my argument to the Government is stronger than that. Edinburgh is our capital city in Scotland and thus recognises the fact that we are more than just some region of the United Kingdom—indeed, that we are a country. We have a right to protect that position. If Wheatley made a mistake, as I believe that he did, we should be big enough to admit it and rectify it. It will be far easier to do so now than in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was rather curious. It was not out of character, but was typical of the hon. Gentleman's small-minded approach. I have yet to hear him deliver a speech without making Lothian regional council the main target for his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not follow the hon. Gentleman, although I agree with him in one matter. Any basic criticisms—and I do not have the Stodart report— would arise from the remit given to the committee, which was essentially a recognition by the Government that there is not much wrong with local government structures. There can be arguments about management, cost efficiency and all the rest, but there is a general acceptance of the main structures as finalised by the House a few years ago. I do not have time to go into the differences that arose, but I suggest that some hon. Members on the Government Benches, including the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, re-read our debates on local government concerning some of these single-tier ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good job has been done. I do not even quarrel with the Secretary of State for singling out industrial
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
development in promotion and tourism. We should severely criticise him if he had not devoted nearly all his remarks to the two points concerning jobs. I have no quarrel with the fact that he had obviously to admit all sorts of other things of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Secretary of State could be criticised for —I hope that the Minister will take this on board— is the general lowering of morale in local government, as pointed out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). I am not relating that to the further opportunities that we shall have to discuss the latest action by the Secretary of State and the confrontation course that both sides seem to be pursuing. I am referring to the fact that we warned the Government during the passage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, that they were taking away power from local authorities. I believe that the Minister would concede that some of us were desperately anxious to reach a compromise, but none was forthcoming from the Government about the inalienable right to bypass local authorities and give the power to the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general proposition may be arguable, but neither the Secretary of State nor the Minister can get away from the fact that there is an atmosphere of discontent and near confrontation. I am thinking not merely about Lothian but in general terms, and the cuts in public expenditure make life no easier for elected representatives at both levels of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my remarks to the machinery for ensuring that local government is healthy and efficient—if that is not being too optimistic. I wish briefly to mention two subjects. I do not disagree with the Government's recommendation on community councils. It is wise—as the Stodart committee did— to place the emphasis on the district council. I am not making a public criticism, but I believe that, although Strathclyde has an excellent record in helping community councils, there is a wee bit too much of a belief that, if one area receives funds, then another must also have them out of the famous community chest set up by Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfortunate if remarks such as that were reported. I usually complain that remarks of significance are not reported, but I find it a little odd that the Machrihanish community council should be the recipient of funds from the Strathclyde regional council. I consider that Machrihanish is one of the nicest places in Scotland, but I do not believe that it could be called a deprived area. It does not require a playground with five miles of sand and wonderful scenery for kids to play in. I am getting to be almost as bad as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, so I had better leave the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am merely saying that we must consider the recommendations on community councils. In spite of what happened in Edinburgh, I believe that they have proved a success for local government and deserve to be nurtured and encouraged. They are important not just because of the money that they get or because of their statutory responsibilities, they show that local people have a genuine interest in their area. I hope that the Minister will say a word
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
of encouragement, in spite of the embarrassment that it may cause in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to salaries, many of us have long argued that a major mistake or shortcoming of the previous Tory Government was the attitude which they adopted at the time. It was typical of their carping approach and their unwillingness to treat local government in general as an equal partner or to give it confidence, including even such trivial matters as visits abroad. I am afraid that the same attitude came through to some extent this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister on the key issue. The problem will not go away. I do not agree with the submission of certain Glasgow Members, although it was a reasonably well-argued case. The basic difficulties in local government in Scotland stem from the fact that no two areas are alike. Of course, the form of local government in Moray and Nairn is entirely different from that in Glasgow, even though they are both technically described as district council authorities and have the same statutory responsibilities. The size, scale and whole approach is different, and I believe that machinery should be set up to examine local government. I make the suggestion without having thought out or clarified in detail what the machinery should be, but it is totally inadequate to have a debate in the House lasting two and a half hours without the Government having finalised their proposals on legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to be as flexible as possible in preparing legislation and I ask my colleagues on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs to use that Committee for pre-legislative examination of local government. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that I ask that in a genuine all-party context. I believe that the suggestion has merit, and we may be able to better understand which recommendations the Government will accept and which they will not. I do not believe that we can accept every one, but I plead for some sort of machinery which will give Members of Parliament ample opportunity to examine in detail the recommendations arising from the report that require legislation and to look ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in regard to looking ahead, I do not know what sort of review body there should be. Perhaps I am not expressing my ideas adequately, but, from my knowledge of district councils—I am sure that the Minister will accept my view—I consider that, by and large, they do an excellent job. The variety of scale and the nature of the job sometimes depressed me. Too many officials and councillors in some of the smaller authorities spend too much time on small issues, which is natural It is the same as Members of Parliament spending too much time on the " ambulance " type of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there should be greater opportunity for a dialogue within authorities. I am not criticising COSLA, although it has its weaknesses. We have never examined the subject in a helpful and constructive way to see whether the two-tier structure of local government—although I support its retention—may have made COSLA the ineffective organisation that it is. I do not say that in a critical
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sense, but we need to look at the subject openly and discuss with COSLA and colleagues in local government how to produce a more effective body to provide a continuing review and keep in good health what I regard as a fundamental and democratic institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that the Stodart committee was set up with such a restricted remit. The second item of the terms of reference states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" to recommend whether any transfer or rationalisation of functions between them is desirable and consistent with fully maintaining the viability of the existing authorities".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) said that that would postulate that there is not much wrong with local government. I believe that the Government considered that it would be too expensive and that there would be too much dislocation in making a substantial change now, and, therefore, took the view that this is local government and we are stuck with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the committee was required to carry out the review constrained by those terms caused much frustration. It stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ' maintain the viability of the existing authorities' clearly invites us to assume that every local authority is viable just now ".</p></blockquote>
The committee also regretted that it had not been given the remit to think in terms of a major reorganisation. I fully support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 Act provided for certain functions to be exercised concurrently by district and region—industrial development, planning measures, leisure, recreation and so on. The one major recommendation of the Stodart committee was that these functions should no longer be exercised concurrently, thus avoiding the duplication of energies and resources that has been inherent in the two-tier system since its inception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the whole tenor of the report to be that we should look at the idea of the single-tier authorities. On page 11 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we must take note of the substantial body of opinion—not least among some local authorities—which maintains the belief that only the creation of all—or, at least, most—purpose authorities throughout the country will produce a wholly satisfactory system of local government".</p></blockquote>
On page 12 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" a networth of single-tier authorities would undoubtedly have considerable attractions and would avoid most of the difficulties inherent in a two-tier arrangement".</p></blockquote>
On the same page:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the Western Islands Council made it clear to us that the present arrangements (for them) had brought many real advantages and this point was echoed in several submissions as evidence of the merits of a single-tier structure ".</p></blockquote>
For 20 years I was in local government as a town councillor. For 10 of those years I was also concurrently a county councillor. The functions of the county council covered the other side of Scotland. I well understand the frustration over the division of functions, overlapping and so on. I have not

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
served on the new Western Islands council, but I admit that it has made a tremendous difference to me and to the authority for the council to have the power of control, and it has also made a tremendous difference in improving the whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was reported in The Scotsman on 29 January:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the committee described as " invidious " the need for it to keep the recommendations consistent with maintaining the viability of the present authorities ".</p></blockquote>
The problems which the committee has identified fall largely into three main groups. I have already spoken on concurrency. The second group covers interdependence. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the inter-dependence of so many local Government responsibilities means that, although formally allocated to one tier, functions can only be fully exercised when both Region and District are involved".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The third group covers … the problems created by political conflicts."</p></blockquote>
They are not necessarily party political conflicts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee decided that the industrial development powers should go to the regions. Promotion of tourism within Scotland would be the function of the districts. The Committee also recommended—hon. Members have referred to this —that the promotion of tourism abroad should be carried out solely by the Scottish Tourist Board. The Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) was designed to> achieve that object but unfortunately it was opposed by Conservative Members and it did not get anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards Scottish promotion abroad, does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that many statements have been issued, but that very few have been based on fact? The representative of the British Tourist Authority in the United States is a Scot—he is a piper. Secondly, the Scottish element or input in the United States is 10 per cent, of the population, but we enjoy about 30 per cent, of the promotion. Finally, I can confirm that the United States agencies for promoting tourism in the United Kingdom give adequate space to Scotland—I spent five weeks on the eastern seeboard of the United States checking that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not argue with the hon. Gentleman. However, the chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board would wish to have those powers and that seems to be a sufficient argument. Clearly, he is not content that Scotland has been projected as a tourist country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) said about councillors in Scotland. Whatever their party, the bulk of them are men of sincere and honest endeavour who wish to do something for their communities. The attacks which they sometimes come under are deplorable. I also agree with the right hon. Gentleman's remarks about salary. I have taken that view all along. I thought that the requirements of time and so on in respect of councillors would make it necessary to fix a salary for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I shall not deal with the recommendations; they are all sensible. The Secretary of State said today that he had adopted about 95 per cent.—perhaps it was more—which is most satisfactory. Most referred to questions between regional and district councillors. I do not have that problem and so shall not take up the Committee's time on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that it had been a useful tidying up exercise. However, it is regrettable that it did not go all the way. When making such an investigation, a Government should simply say to the committee " Investigate local government in Scotland. Let the chips fall where they may. Give us the facts and your recommendations." For whatever reasons, perhaps expense or the time not being right, a Government in their judgment might well not adopt the recommendations at a particular time. That would be understandable. However, it was wrong to set up a committee to examine local government and to tie its hands in that way. The committee said that the next review should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>" on a country-wide basis by a committee with a remit, timetable and resources specifically geared to the task."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that is what local government in Scotland demands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray and Nairn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make one or two brief observations on the Stodart report, with particular reference to Moray, which has already been mentioned—not least sotte voce by Opposition Front Benchers. I am happy to respond to their prompting in that regard. I am delighted that the local authority affairs on the North-East coast command such consuming interest on the part of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Stodart committee was first set up, there was uncertainty in the public mind about how wide a remit it had been given. On the one hand, it appeared as though it could consider requests from district councils seeking the status of an all-purpose or most-purpose authority. Indeed, Moray district council was one which, in the best of all possible worlds, would have wished to be considered for such a status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the Stodart committee realised that it was not possible to treat such requests with any degree of finality unless the Government made clear their preparedness to consider major changes on a comprehensive national basis. I believe that that is why paragraph 29 of the committee's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We have examined Moray's case with care. The nub of it is that, if any district in Grampian is to be given all—or most—purpose status, Moray is the logical choice since it has ' the population, skills, resources and all other requirements to meet such a role'."</p></blockquote>
I hear an echo of approval from my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Myles), whose constituency, like mine, includes part of that district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Therefore, the Stodart committee has in a sense acknowledged the viability and excellence of Moray district council, while recognising that its remit precludes it from granting such a request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we are to operate a two-tier structure for the foreseeable future, let me make a few brief points. First, I welcome the Secretary of State's strong commitment to allowing the district tier to retain its role in industrial development. I believe that it would be wrong to take away that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, I am extremely pleased to learn that there is no question of the district councils' losing their planning function. That was in the air at one time, and I am happy that the Government felt able to accept Stodart's recommendations in that regard, not least because I believe that the planning function has a bearing on the quality and calibre of our councillors. If the district tier were to lose that function, I believe that its effectiveness in implementing its wide range of powers would be so truncated that the quality of those coming forward to serve would inevitably diminish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am pleased that the planning function is to remain, I should like to make a specific plea to the Minister. I urge the Government—as I have urged them before—to ask, when considering prospective legislation, whether it is really advisable to impose charges on those making planning applications to the district authority. In Moray, certainly, that has created enormous local ill-feeling, both within the district council and among those who want to contribute to the development of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district council is well able to raise revenue without that extra means. It does not enjoy raising revenue from such sources. It feels that payment— in effect—has already been made, through the rates. The council is also unhappy about the extra pressure that can be put on councillors when finance is an extra element in the planning application. Therefore, I ask by hon. Friend, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to deliberate about whether we should impose the compulsory charging scheme for planning applications coming before the district authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stodart recognised the excellence of local authorities such as Moray district council, and the Secretary of State has been kind enough on occasion to compliment them on the Floor of the House. However, when the recommendations have been carried out and the legislation has been put into effect, will the Government give a firm undertaking that the system will be subjected to no further tinkering, reviewing or restructuring for a significant period? I suggest an undertaking that it would be the intention to let the system run for at least 10 years before any further major review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system has been upset for a variety of reasons; it wants to settle down, and it behoves us all to give those who seek to serve in that forum of public office the chance to do so without constant uncertainty about their future. In the hope of such an undertaking, I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one could accuse the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) of not pushing Moray's case in this Committee, even though he did not win the gallon of whisky yesterday in the shuttle coming down from Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the current difficulties facing local government in Scotland, it seems to me that the legislation at the margins which the Secretary of State proposes in the next parliamentary session will be of very little benefit either to the local authorities or to the public at large. The fault lies not with the Stodart committee, because I think that it was tied hand and foot by the terms of reference given to it by the Government at the end of 1979. The real problem that the Stodart committee was unable to deal with was the survival of Scottish local government. The report talks of the viability of existing authorities but, at present, the basic difficulties facing local authorities in Scotland are more a matter of lack of resource than of structure. I do not think that we need worry about tinkering with the structural arrangements of local government, because the basic problem is one of resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the radio interview that the Secretary of State had at the end of last week on his forthcoming proposals on local government finance, and I got the clear impression that he sees local authorities as being more or less agents of the central Government's economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even this Government have to concede that Parliament lays down specific duties for local authorities and that they have to fulfil those obligations. Therefore, the authorities require a stability in the basic services that they provide and ought not to be thrown off course every time that the Government decide to change their economic policies whatever they may happen to be. Those of us who consider these matters realise that the Conservatives have never had any power base in Scottish local Government, so to that extent they do not feel obliged to strengthen the system. With few and intermittent exceptions, they tend not to be greatly involved in the actual practice of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly mention something that has now come to the forefront of British politics, namely the " save our inner cities " problem? I want to mention the Maryhill corridor project area, which I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael) . This was one of the three priority areas within the city of Glasgow, the others being the East End project, on a much more substantial scale, and the Priesthill area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems in the admirable co-operation that by and large has existed between the Glasgow district and the Strathclyde regional council over the Maryhill corridor project area has been the fact that they are sustaining a project within their overall budget resources and now that their overall budget resources are under pressure many of the things that we had hoped to see done within the corridor project are at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Another aspect of the special treatment approach is that since one is dealing with a variety of public bodies, the housing corporation, the Scottish Development Agency, SSHA, and sometimes the Manpower Services Commission, each operating within the limits of separate budgets, it is sometimes difficult to integrate matters which are best dealt with on a local and community level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to the changes that were proposed on industrial responsibilities. I think that the districts should retain responsibility by and large for such matters, but sometimes they are not particularly good at it. Part of the reason is that there seems to be an impression that a magic carpet to America is better than concentrating on some of the home-grown industries that should be strengthened within communities. Perhaps there has been too much planning and not enough go-getting in their approach to incoming industry or to sustaining indigenous industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a final point—it is not covered in the report—with regard to the education system. We are now reaching a point in local government where the central Government are dictating strongly and arbitrarily the staffing arrangements that should exist within the education authorities. I think that one-quarter of the wage and salary bill in Scottish local government goes to teachers, college lecturers and others within this section. The time may not be far off when the central Government should meet the cost, since they are more or less telling the local authorities how to spend this money. The case for doing that may be particularly strong in the further education sector which, in the years to come, will have to work much more closely with the central institutions and other elements in further and higher education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to speak because I believe that the Stodart report is perhaps even more important than those of us who have taken part in the debate realise. Local government is an essential part of the good government of Scotland. Anything that we do to improve and enhance it is important. Equally, anything that we do to detract from it can be damaging to the citizens of Scotland. My own council for Perth and Kinross district accepts and welcomes the recommendations which the Secretary of State has accepted from the Stodart report. The members of that council are not in poor heart— their morale is very good. I have been asked by the leading members of the district council to make that point because they are happy with the situation that exists, bearing in mind the difficulties that we as a nation are facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They also give a very warm welcome to the Secretary of State's decision on industrial development. They felt, quite properly in my view, that they could look after the interests of Perth better. They also believed that the district council in Dundee could look after the welfare of its citizens better. These are the two district councils in which I have an interest and, therefore, I am particularly
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
pleased that this has been agreed. They also felt that they could handle leisure and recreation and, in conjunction with the region, they accepted and welcomed this decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter over which there has been some acrimony and which has probably exercised the minds of many is tourism. Tourism is no longer an ad hoc activity carried on in addition to everything else; it is an essential part of the Scottish economy. I shall go further. Tourism is a vital part of the Scottish economy. Therefore, it was only right and proper that we should look carefully at all the organisations that were dabbling in tourism. There were too many and they were dabbling often in opposition to each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I mentioned the British Tourist Authority. I am pleased that the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craighton (Mr. Millan) is in his seat because as an individual Member of Parliament I was concerned about stories on our poor presentation and representation in the United States. Last year I decided to inquire into the matter myself to find out at first hand whether the stories had any substance. As I said in an earlier intervention, they were a distortion of the facts. They were quite untrue. Scotland is well represented in the United States by the British Tourist Authority. If there is a complaint it is probably that we should give the British Tourist Authority more money so that it could spend more. I was satisfied and pleased to discover that its promotion of Scotland is very professional. I was even more satisfied when I discovered that man running the promotion on behalf of the British Tourist Authority is a Scot from Fife. That meant that Scotland, as ever, was being represented in the areas that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With 10 per cent. of the United Kingdom population we enjoyed about 30 per cent. of the British Tourist Authority's promotion in the United States and it seemed that the claims being made were nonsense. I wonder whether we should not always look carefully at statements made by individuals who might be more interested in empire and image building than in results. We must look at results, because that is what matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point I should like also to give credit and say " Thank you " to Tayside region, which has done a splendid- professional job in attempting to bring tourists to Tayside. In some ways I regret that it will no longer be responsible for this activity in my constituency. However, I am confident that Perth, Kinross and Dundee district councils will be capable of handling the matter in a professional manner be" cause they have been given an example by the Tayside region that could and should be followed by both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of salary for councillors that was raised by the right hon. Member for Craig-ton. I have discussed the matter with both my regional and district councillors. There were differing views. Some felt that salaries should be paid and others felt that it would be a quite wrong and retrograde step. The consensus was that whatever was done had adequately to compensate individuals for the impingement on their leisure and business time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
so that the public could see not that councillors were making money out of what they were doing but that they were properly and adequately recompensed. The majority view was that councillors should not be paid salaries—although some felt that they should be—but would prefer to be paid adequate expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock). I, too, hope that we will now stop tinkering with local government and let it get on with the job. I hope that we will stop trying to make political capital out of the problems of running our nation in times of great difficulty. I hope that my speech will be regarded as constructive rather than destructive, and that it will be recognised, especially by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), that I do not believe that everything Dundee district does is bad, because it is not. It does some things that are good. However, where it is treading in areas which merit comment, I should be failing in my duty to my constituents in that district if I did not draw attention to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we have only a short time I shall ignore the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) I should like to know on whose behalf he spoke. I know that the Kingoodie and Invergowrie community council disagreed with him last week about whether he spoke on its behalf on another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayreshire (Mr. Foulkes) and others gave evidence to the Stodart committee. But what disappointed me most was that Stodart was not given a remit to recommend major changes such as the abolition of the regions and the creation of all-purpose and most-purpose authorities. We would have recommended that Dundee should become a most-purpose authority. That was also the view of many organisations and bodies in Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, during my discussions on Stodart, I contacted all the councils, and almost all were unanimous. Downfield, West End, Caird, Lochee, Hill Town, Dundee local health council were agreed. The only organisation that disagreed was the Scottish branch of the British Red Cross Society. I am not sure why. The argument on whether there should be a most-purpose authority in Dundee centred on the fact that Tayside region might become less viable. I would argue that, in population terms, if we removed Dundee from consideration the remainder of Tayside region, which is 10 times greater than Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles—each of which administers its own education and social work service—quite clearly could still exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) the full time for his speech. So I shall be brief. I had an opportunity of giving written and oral evidence to Stodart. I conclude by saying that not only did I hold the view, along with local committees, councils and
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
various other organisations that Dundee should become a most-purpose authority. If I had time I would commend to the Committee's attention the proposals contained in the document that was unanimously adopted by the full Dundee district council on Monday 17 March 1980. The document highlighted the shortcomings in the existing functions of the two-tier structure of local government when operated in an area such as Dundee district. I think that it illustrated clearly how the discharge of functions within a district council's area could be carried out. Despite their coming from a Conservative-controlled district council, the proposals in the document were far-sighted and I fully support them. I regret that Stodart did not feel able to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a morning not without interest. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) allowed himself the luxury of praising Dundee district council. We should pay tribute to that, at least. This summer the hon. Gentleman apparently added to his wide but not always relevant store of personal experience by going to look at the British Tourist Authority's activities in America. He forgot to tell us whether he piloted his own plane there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also heard a rather daring analogy from the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), who said that it did not matter which way the chips fell. I imagine that that is something to do with the gambling tables in the casinos of this world. I had a technical discussion with my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) about whether the analogy was with blackjack, roulette or chemin de fer. I shall probably have to wait until the end of the debate to hear the expert opinion of the right hon. Member for Western Isles on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious note, I wish to take up the speech made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). I know that in debates on local government there is always a temptation for people to defend vested interests and fight their own corner. Nevertheless the hon. Gentleman descended to a form of kailyard politics that does no honour or credit to himself or his party. He spoke for some time about the real problems that we face, especially in Glasgow. He made lengthy references to Glasgow's declining population, giving the impression that he ascribed all problems to the 1975 regionalisation. He seemed to be suggesting that many of those problems would be solved if we established one-purpose authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not we believe in such all-purpose authorities, the hon. Gentleman would do better to vent his spleen on the economic policies of his own Government if he is worried about what is happening in Glasgow and West Central Scotland. The Tory Government and Tory economic policy have laid waste and ravaged whole industries and populations in Glasgow, in other parts of Scotland and in the rest of the United Kingdom. I find such chauvinistic attachment to the concept of Edinburgh as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
the capital city remarkable for someone whose political utterances on almost every subject—certainly over the past year or two—have run counter to such concern. It is intemperate and wrong to speak of Edinburgh, as did the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, as a carcase upon which the surrounding region feeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton very properly criticised those who make unreasoning and unreasonable attacks on the integrity of local councillors and the effectiveness of the job that they do. No one in the Committee is more guilty of such intemperance than the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South. It is time that he recognised that as chairman of his party in Scotland he has a wider responsibility than acting as axe man for the reactionary views found in Barnton and Morningside. He must try to rise a little above that level. I often lead missionary exercises into areas such as Morning-side—they are not always as rewarding as I should hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to more general matters. The Secretary of State's opening remarks were very different in tone from those of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South. T believe that the right hon. Gentleman does not like offending unless he has to, so it must be one of his private tragedies that he finds himself Secretary of State for Scotland in a Government doing so many offensive things. That must make life extremely difficult for the right hon. Gentleman. He bumbled his way happily through his prepared script. I believe that he likes spreading confusion, on the probably safe assumption that if one is a Conservative in Scotland at present, the less people know about what one is doing the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's speech seemed to hudge and mudge almost every issue. We were told that the regions were not to have a role in tourism— although it was not quite as clear-cut as that, because something called an ATO is now to flower on the Scottish administrative scene. We were told that the Scottish Tourist Board would not have a separate role promoting Scotland abroad. That was not clear-cut, either, and we were to be cast a sop in the form of a director of tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that the responsibility for industry was not to be taken away from the districts, but the Secretary of State did not have the courage to go for the dissenting report, but instead favoured the note of reservation, which is a compromise. One of the Secretary of State's tragedies is that, whenever he is allowed to do so, he homes in upon the weak compromise, if that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that the Opposition welcome, by and large, the Stodart committee's report. I believe that that is sensible and necessary, although it is a limited rationalisation and reappraisal of the local government reforms that were carried through in the mid 1970s. In 1975, I was a local government employee, and I remember well sitting on some of the committees that laid the foundations for the present Strathclyde region. I had fundamental doubts then and, if I were to start with a clean sheet, I think that I would have constructed a different
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
system. I feel that Strathclyde, and other regions in Scotland, have operated well and efficiently on the whole, in difficult circumstances. Although I mention the regions, I distinguish them from districts only because they have been the subject of controversy. I would extend that phrase and commendation to the whole system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we cannot contemplate at this stage the kind of upheaval, disruption and expense that would be entailed in major re-organisation. I draw particular attention to the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton that we shall be back at the question of devolution in the near future. Only after devolution has been settled—and implemented, 1 hope—shall we be able to see the final shape of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one other, general, point, that the problem is not in the structure of local government. Government policy is the key to and the basis of the present discontent about the performance of local government. I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 18 of the Stodart report, where it is pointed out that, since 1975, Government policy on public expenditure
	<br><blockquote><p>" has created difficulties for the new authorities of a kind virtually unknown to their predecessors."</p></blockquote>
I put in that part of the quotation because I wanted to be fair. If the members of the Stodart committee were worried about what they describe as " virtually unknown " kind of difficulty for local authorities, their anxiety would be greatly intensified if they were sitting today. It is only in the past few months that we have been faced with almost unprecedented moves to encroach and impinge upon the freedom of action of local authorities in regard to policy and finance. I am sure that the Secretary of State would be the first to agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some specific points. I understand that the Government intend that the Stodart recommendations should be operative by April 1983. That means, presumably, that a Bill will be introduced early in the next Session. I know that there will be consultation, but I hope that the Secretary of State will make it clear that the consultation will be not only on how to do things, but on what should be done. My right hon. Friend said that he had not had many representations—for understandable reasons—on the details of Stodart. I have received some representations, and I know that there could be many detailed consultations of real importance to those who are carrying out and implementing local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 167 of the report, there is a suggestion—apparently accepted by the Government— that sections 1, 2, 6 and 18 of the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 should become the preserve of the district councils. This is not the time to go into that in detail, but it would involve the transfer of food labelling and standards from the regional councils to the district councils. As an example of the detailed argument that we must have—I hope that such matters will be looked at with an open mind—I ask whether it is really sensible to transfer food labelling and food standards to the district councils. Admittedly, those are in charge of food
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
hygiene, but such a transfer would be away from the authority that is in charge of trade descriptions and weights and measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of what is most efficient in staff effort— the argument is one of efficiency, and is not a matter of principle—I am unsure whether Wheatley was right and Stodart is wrong. Perhaps Stodart was influenced by the need to give something to the districts, rather than considering their merits. It is an argument to which we shall wish to return when we have legislation. I hope that we shall be able to do so during the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask one specific, tiny question which has been raised with me. The Minister will be aware that, in paragraph 168, egg grading, which is carried on under the 1973 regulations, is recommended for transfer to the districts. However, that is not included in the list of Stodart's recommendations, although it is in gremio—in the text. I am not sure whether or not it is included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hurry on to the question of attracting industry, and underline a plea that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Craighton, to move not by legislation but, if possible, by agreement. I do not wish to talk in terms of a Big Brother attitude on the part of the Government, but they would probably accept that co-operation, if it can be achieved, is much better than dictation. The idea that one should legislate to prevent, if one can get agreement to regulate, would be a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking personally, I am sorry that the Government have ended up in the halfway house with a note of reservation when they decided to reject the clear-cut recommendation from the Stodart committee. It is not practical to keep the districts— particularly the larger districts—out of industrial promotion. I should have preferred the view of the minority report on that point. However, I say that without departing for a moment from the general principle that we must have a properly ordered approach to overseas promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who was at the time chairman of the Select Committee that looked at that subject, I am especially grateful to the Secretary of State for his response to that Select Committee. There was a clearcut division in the Committee—sadly, on political lines—and the Secretary of State had at least the courage to reject the advice of his own Back Benchers and to go broadly for the solution supported by the Labour Party. It would be churlish of me not to say that I appreciate that he had to give a hard slap in the face to his hon. Friends. He did not flinch from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I find it extraordinary that, having argued, as the Secretary of State did, the strong case for a continuing Scottish industrial presence abroad, two or three minutes later in the same speech this morning he cheerfully argued that there was no such case for a Scottish presence abroad in tourism. That seems to me a total illogicality. The arguments are on all fours, and there is a case in both matters for the Scottish Tourist Board. Though I do not always agree with the board's chairman and I certainly do not agree
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
with all its policies, there is a strong case for its having those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ludicrous that the Highlands and Islands Development Board, for example, has a tourism remit abroad but, apparently, the Scottish Tourist Board is not to have one. It would be extraordinary to hear from any other Minister such incompatible arguments, combined, in such a short space of time, but that is the muddle with which we have become all too familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish by mentioning two other points. Salaries for local councillors were mentioned as an afterthought in the Stodart report, but a quite valuable afterthought. We should think in terms of salaries for local councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister looks at his detailed replies—lodged in the Library as a deposited paper—he will see what I shall not call a dishonesty, for I am sure that it was unintentional, but a misleading passage. He says in paragraph 16:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The concept of a salary for councillors was considered and rejected by the Robinson Committee."</p></blockquote>
However, the Robinson committee's first recommendation is:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The existing attendance allowance system should be abolished."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to reject a full-time salary. I think that few of us would suggest a full-time salary for all councillors. That would be ludicrous. But it specifically recommends
	<br><blockquote><p>" A basic annual payment "</p></blockquote>
which at that time, 1977, it suggested should be £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say, therefore, that the committee rejected a salary concept is misleading. I certainly find the arguments in paragraph 241 of the Stodart report entirely convincing, and I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to rating. My right hon. Friend talked about that. I asked a question the other day about whether the quinquennial revaluation in 1983 was to go ahead, and I was told that in due course the Secretary of State would announced whether he proposed to use his powers to postponed or vary the next revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that I cannot expect to be told the answer in a question from myself, because obviously Ministers cherish dearly the possibility of using the question planted upon one of their inoffensive colleagues as at least evidence of life on his part. In this Government, that is probably a valuable piece of machinery. I do not care how we know, but I am certain that we must know very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was common ground in the discussions of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill that about two years was needed for the run-up to a quinquennial revaluation. If we are to wait for an autumn consultative paper, we must know before then whether the quinquennial revaluation is to go ahead. Perhaps the Minister will address his mind to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must now conclude, to give the Minister time to make his position clear. I believe that local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
government problems have been screened to some extent today because we have had to plunge into the detail and munutiae of the Stodart report and into administrative niceties. That is a way of forgetting the sort of massive confrontation between central Government and local government that the Secretary of State's obstinacy has engineered, which is potentially most damaging. For that reason it has been a strangely detached debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the real world of local government, there is the drear prospect of confrontation—and of higher rates, which would be inevitable even if every one of the Government's policies was successfully implemented. In fact, because there is a danger of those policies being implemented there will almost inevitably be higher rates and declining services. While I welcome the many sensible detailed points that the Stodart report makes and the fact that the Secretary of State accepts the majority of them, I must tell the Government that some concession on sanity in the wider field of local authority finance—-and a retreat from the brink of senseless strife and trouble that they are inflicting on us all—would be far more welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with very great interest to the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I noted that he attacked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State as someone who always believed in the flabby, weak compromise. But as the hon. Gentleman seems to spend most of his time attacking my right hon. Friend for a rigid inflexibility in his attitude towards local authorities, it would seem that he really wants a system of hard, inflexible compromise!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend stated that they had been bereft of representations about the Stodart report from local authorities, which apparently proved that the authorities were so involved in the financial crisis which had been imposed on them by the Government that they simply had no time to think about such matters. But while the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend may have been neglected by the local authorities, the Government have received representations from every regional council and from 50 of the 53 district councils. I can understand that local authorities feel it is not worth their while letting the Opposition know their views, but that is not because those views do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) made a very irresponsible suggestion that somehow the disturbances in cities could be linked to low spending by local authorities. That view was put yesterday by a leading NUPE representative in Scotland. It is a most simplistic explanation of the problems facing urban areas. One need only ask why a major riot area in recent weeks has been Brixton. It is in Lambeth, which is not exactly a low-spending authority. Such dangerous assumptions do no service to a complex and difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I welcome the fact that all those who have spoken in the debate have congratulated my
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
noble friend Lord Stodart of Leaston and his committee for their valuable work, which has been of considerable benefit. Points of substance have been put to me, and I shall try to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Craigton suggested that the distinction between industrial promotion and development was somewhat artificial and therefore inappropriate. But I do not believe that that is a strong argument. Clearly, industrial development and the provision of factory space and mortgage facilities, and so forth, by local authorities are quite different matters from the overseas promotion exercises with which the new powers being sought by the Secretary of State are primarily concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly we recognise the point made by the right hon. Gentleman that it is worth pursuing the idea of a code of practice and certain other voluntary mechanisms to restrict the overlap. That is worth considering. The Government and the Opposition appear to share the objective of wishing to reduce unnecessary duplication and confusing competition between individual district councils and local authorities in their overseas promotion efforts, and the debate should properly focus on the best way of achieving, what I think is a similar objective, the eventual outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also referred to community centres and suggested that the position on leisure and recreation was confused because of its effects on community and eduction centres. I hope that was not his view, although that was the impression he gave, because we have made it clear from the start that community centres are continuing to be a concurrent function, primarily for the reasons which the right hon. Gentleman himself indicated. Many of them are parts of schools or educational establishments, and it would be undesirable and, in some respects, impossible to divorce these two areas of activity within a community centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate on tourism has concerned the overseas role promoted by the Scottish Tourist Board, and the hon. Member for Garscadden is quite wrong to suggest that there is something inconsistent between, on the one hand, seeking to give to regional councils and the Locate in Scotland bureau an overseas promotion activity while, at the same time, declining that role for the Scottish Tourist Board. The reason is simple. If we did not have a British Tourist Authority—if one did not exist or had not been created in the past—then, of course, with the Scottish Tourist Board being the single Government tourist agency there would be an overwhelming case for giving it an overseas promotion role. Some hon. Gentlemen, though not all, have appreciated that one cannot argue for the maintenance of the British Tourist Authority and at the same time give a comparable overseas role to the Scottish Tourist Board without unnecessary expense of duplication for very little benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nationalist Members clearly wish to abolish the British Tourist Authority, and that is a logical view for them to take, but the hon. Member for Garscadden and his hon. Friends have not really given the Committee the benefit of their views. Are they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
actually calling for the abolition of the BTA? If they are not, it should be borne in mind that there would be considerable duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There need be no duplication. Mine is not a strange proposition. The previous chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board took exactly the same view as I propounded this morning, as does the present chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board. The only satisfactory way of dealing with overseas promotion is to give powers to the Scottish Tourist Board. How far it exercised these powers and how far it continued to co-operate with the BTA would depend basically on how far the BTA was willing to co-operate with it. Without these powers, the STB is itself in a weak position in relation to the BTA. The hon. Gentleman must know that, because the BTA is a centralist body and is headed up at present by an extremely centralist chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that the Scottish Tourist Board would like overseas promotion powers. That is not entirely surprising. It is in the nature of any organisation to wish to extend its activities; it would be less than human not to. But the right hon. Gentleman must appreciate that one could hardly give such a role to the Scottish Tourist Board without giving a similar role to the English Tourist Board, the Welsh Tourist Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would lead either to unnecessary duplication or to the abolition of the British Tourist Authority, but the right hon. Gentleman is unwilling to follow through the consequences of his own proposals. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) about the role that is pursued by the British Tourist Authority at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Craighton and his hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell (Mr. Hamilton) took different views on the question of councillors' salaries. I take exception, if I may, to a remark made by the right hon. Member for Craigton, who said that the Labour Government's record was no better than the Conservative Government's on this question of help towards councillors' expenses. The record of the Labour Government is actually considerably worse, because this Government have been the first to introduce special responsibility payments for senior members of local authorities, and, while I fully appreciate that that has not met the demand that exists in some quarters for proper or part-time salaries, nevertheless it is an indication of the Government's willingness to appreciate the burdens on those who hold senior office in the local authorities, and the special responsibility system has been warmly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) spoke about enabling those involved in housing developments to produce their own basic water and sewerage facilities as long as they conformed to minmum requirements that were laid down. I am happy to give my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
the undertaking that we shall pursue that proposal, because it has interesting implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bothwell asked about taxis which cross local authority boundaries. That matter will be covered by the Civic Government Bill, which will provide an opportunity to reach a sensible solution for what is undoubtedly a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of all-purpose or most-purpose authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), the hon Members for Dundee (Mr. Ross) and for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) all made reference to that topic. The difficulty that exists, particularly in regard to Edinburgh and Glasgow, is that while no one disputes that, considered in isolation, Edinburgh or Glasgow could be an all-purpose authority, a problem arises about what the consequences would be for the remainder of the regions of which they presently form part. There is no way in which Edinburgh or Glasgow could become all-purpose authority without a fundamental change or, some would argue, a disintegration of the original areas in which they are situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some have suggested that if they could not become all-purpose authorities perhaps they should become most-purpose authorities and that Edinburgh and Glasgow should have greater functions than other district councils. We gave that matter some thought, and the difficulty that emerges is that if we gave to Edinburgh or Glasgow the responsibility for education or social work but not to other district councils in the same area, we would encounter enormous difficulties when it came to taking decisions within the regional council on, say education in West Lothian. There would be a new form of the West Lothian question whereby the regional councillors from Edinburgh would be taking part in deliberations on the educational policy in the rest of the Lothian region while there was no corresponding ability to influence regional policy within Edinburgh. The same would apply in Glasgow and Strathclyde to the various districts there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there are deep practical problems and, but for these, we would have been attracted to the idea that the two major cities in Scotland should have greater functions and powers than other disrict councils that were much smaller in size. So far we have not been able to conceive of a way in which that could be done without fundamental problems of the sort to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan made reference to the possible consideration by the Select Committee of the Stodart recommendations and of changes of structure in local government. That is an attractive suggestion which is obviously for others to pursue but the hon. Gentleman has put forward a very useful idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly accept the suggestion made by the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton that we should take every opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by individual councillors, the vast majority of whom receive no proper remuneration or reward for the enormous amounts of time that they provide.

I believe that all members of the Committee recognise that, and it is a matter that has to be placed on the record.

My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) put forward the case for his district council, but at the same time he argued for no further structural change for many years to come. I believe that he will accept that the Stodart recommendations concluded that there was no reason why Moray should be singled out from other district councils within the Grampian region. I certainly agree with his general request. It is desirable that there should be a period of stability in the structure of local government, and the Government have no intention at present to make changes other than those arising out of the Stodart recommendations.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) also raised the matter of industrial promotion. He rightly made the point that districts are not always the best bodies to concentrate on questions of industrial promotion and that some

times local initiatives could make better use of the time available to them.

In conclusion, I thank the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. There has been general agreement that the present structure of local government in Scotland is generally satisfactory and that the changes that are required are changes in detail in order to remove unnecessary complexity and concurrency, thereby to ensure that the people of Scotland receive a more satisfactory structure of local government and a much greater use of the resources that are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
