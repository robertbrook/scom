<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering also the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 2, in page 1, line 10, after " authority ", insert " or school council ";</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I was interrupted by the bell at the end of the previous sitting, I was comparing the system of schools councils in regions such as Strathclyde with that in the Central Region. I was saying that there was great merit in giving schools councils the opportunity of dealing with placing requests in the first instance, and for that opportunity to be written into the Bill.<br><br>
It seems almost to have been assumed by those drafting the legislation that in the first instance the person concerned with dealing with placing requests would be either the director of education of the local education authority involved or one of his assistants. There is great merit in devolving such powers to the schools councils, so that there is a far more democratic, accountable and grassroots way of dealing with placing requests, rather than having that done by someone in an office in Glasgow or Edinburgh, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help the Committee, and to re-emphasise what I said in our previous sitting. In drafting the Bill we were most anxious to leave it to local education authorities to decide how to deal with the very sensitive matter of the first stage of the application.<br><br>
We are in total agreement that it is a splendid idea that that might be done by the schools councils, as happens at present in Strathclyde. But there may be other circumstances that the education authority will take into account that would require the issue
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
to be dealt with in some other way and by somebody else. We are delegating the whole function of deciding how to deal with the first request to the education authorities, knowing that many, if not all, will use schools councils to a great extent in that way. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. But if he were to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 4, which refer to either the authority or the school council we should be able to write into the statute what he admits to be a fairly desirable option. So I cannot see why he is resisting the amendments, and I plead with him to reconsider his earlier statement.<br><br>
The points of view that I am putting across seem to be supported by the local authorities themselves. Fairly recently, some of my hon. Friends and I met representatives of Strathclyde regional council, who gave us some printed comments by the director of education on this aspect of the matter. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill indicates the parent has the right to make a ' placing request' in writing to the authority. The provisions of this clause "—</p></blockquote>
the new section 28A(1)—
<br><blockquote><p>"are intended to deal with the situation where the Director of Education is delegated the authority to deal with applications. In Strathclyde, however, this function has in the past been delegated to schools councils and although there is no doubt that Strathclyde can continue to delegate this power to schools councils, the new arrangements might cause difficulties in the form of an adverse reaction from the schools councils if either their right to deal with placing requests was removed and the requests referred to them for advice only or if they retained this right subject to an overturning power being reserved by the Regional Council."</p></blockquote>
The system of devolving placement requests to schools councils in Strathclydye seems to work fairly well. My hon. Friends and I were given some statistics by the representatives of the regional council which referred to the out-of-zone transfers between 1976 and 1980. In 1976–77, 2,093 applications were received, 1.768 were granted and 325 were refused. In 1977–78, 3,225 applications were received, 2,877 were granted and 348 were refused. In 1978–79, 3,381 applications were received, 3,049 were granted and 332 were refused. In 1979–80, 3,707 applications were received, 3,373 were granted and 334 were refused.<br><br>
The figures for the applications that were granted include appeals. Over those four academic sessions, the total applications received were 12,406, those granted, including appeals, were 11,067, and those refused were only 1,339. In other words, 89 per cent, of the applications received during that time were granted.<br><br>
The Strathclyde schools councils appear to be doing a reasonably good job and are keeping most of the parents there fairly happy. That brings into the question the need for the Government's proposed new system. With the possible exception of parts of Edinburgh, the majority of parents in Strathclyde and the rest of Scotland are happy with the way in which the local education authority—or in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
this instance, the schools councils—deal with placement requests and out-of-zone transfer applications.<br><br>
If any one believes that the Strathclyde regional council is untypical, I remind hon. Members that it deals with half the school children in Scotland. Its views seem to be supported not merely by its own councillors but by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. My hon. Friends and I recently met some of that body's representatives, who gave us a printed statement. In commenting on the insertion of the new section 28A(1), it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This sub-clause refers to the right of a parent to make a ' placing request' in writing to an education authority The provisions of the clause are intended to deal with the situation where the Director of Education is delegated the authority to deal with applications. In some authorities, however"—</p></blockquote>
the plural is used, so it seems that Strathclyde is not unique in that respect—
<br><blockquote><p>"this function is delegated to schools councils, and although such arrangement may be continued, the new proposal might cause difficulties in the form of an adverse reaction from the schools councils if either their right to deal with ' placing requests ' is removed and the requests referred to them for advice only, or if they retain this right subject to an overturning power being reserved to the education authority."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the authorities wish that role of the school councils to be retained and clearly defined. The best way to ensure that would be for the Committee to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 4.<br><br>
I said last week at the beginning of my speech that at the heart of the amendments an important principle was at stake. Do we want an education system in which decisions, whether relating to placement requests or other matters, are made by an over-centralised bureaucracy, or do we want to devolve decision-making to a decentralised democracy? In accepting amendments Nos. 2 and 4, we should choose the latter and wiser course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposal to give more power to the schools councils is most interesting. In some ways we may be drifting towards the beginnings of a school board structure having more direct control over the education system. That, however, is beyond the ambit of the amendments.<br><br>
I must immediately state my objection to the amendments Nos. 1 and 3, which were drafted purely to take care of the Strathclyde situation. They would run counter to what happens with other regional authorities, especially the Tayside authority. As the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) said, they would also run counter to what happens in the Central Region, where schools councils already operate differently from those in Strathclyde. In many parts of Scotland it is common for the schools council to be responsible for one secondary school and its feeder primaries. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 would constrict the present choice open to parents.<br><br>
There is, however, a strong argument for the adoption of amendments Nos. 2 and 4. It is reasonable that there should be an opportunity to continue and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
encourage the system that has evolved in Strathclyde. No doubt it could be continued under the Bill as drafted, but it may not be encouraged unless there is official recognition in the statute. Strathclyde is an exceptionally large authority, and it is hardly surprising that, because of the problems of sheer size, it has attempted to devolve some of the responsibility for school emplacement.<br><br>
The amendments could cause one problem that may crop up later in our proceedings, too—how does one take care of the appeals system when parents object to decisions by schools councils in Strathclyde? Clearly there must be some appeal from the schools councils, and it is not immediately obvious where that would lie. Perhaps those in whose names the amendments stand would be prepared to consider the formula already in the Bill. In Tayside I should probably prefer the schools council to be the place of appeal from the decision originally taken by the education authority.<br><br>
The problem of choice rarely occurs in my area, because our education authority takes a fairly liberal attitude in relation to emplacement and transfer of children to schools of parents' choice. The authority is to be congratulated on that. In addition, the problems of choice will probably become less extensive as school rolls fall and more room becomes available in secondary schools. Restrictions on choice may arise from difficulties over options for specific subjects, as the Red Book standards begin to bite into school staffing as a result of cutbacks in expenditure and the drop in school rolls. Therefore, I shall vote against amendments Nos. 1 and 3 if they are put to the test, and support amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) that neither my hon. Friends nor I intend to press amendments Nos. 1 and 3 to the vote, but we certainly wish press amendments Nos. 2 and 4, for the reasons that the hon. Member has just given.<br><br>
The parents' charter now stands condemned by every responsible body in education, and what was seen at the beginning as a good idea is now regarded by those representing parents, teachers, children and all concerned as a type of restrictive practice. The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council said two weeks ago, on the Friday before the Committee stage started, that the conditions in the parents' charter were much more restrictive than those on parental choice at present.<br><br>
Our examination of the argument, both on Second Reading and in the short time that the Bill has been in Committee will, I am sure, have made hon. Members of all parties recognise that the provisions in clause 1 are very restrictive. My hon. Friends and I tabled the amendments to try to widen the scope of those provisions.<br><br>
I do not wish to be patronising, but I sometimes think that it is not yet appreciated that the administrative structure of Scottish education has changed dramatically. Before the reorganisation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
local government, education authorities were statutory bodies in their own right. An educational authority today is a regional or islands council. It is certainly not what you, Mr. Gourlay, and I knew well in the old days of local government.<br><br>
The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 places an obligation on the education authority—in other words, the regional or islands council—to appoint an education committee. That committee has no delegated powers; its responsibility—like that of every other committee of a regional or islands council—is to deal with education, but all its decisions and recomendations must be ratified by the regional or islands council, which is referred to in the Bill as the education authority.<br><br>
The Minister's proposal, in effect, is to create a bureaucratic structure such as has never been heard of in Scottish education. I stress that early in our debate because I am certain that most people have forgotten that the education authority is not the education committee but the whole islands or regional council.<br><br>
That brings me to the amendments. It is true that, as the Minister stated, the regional or islands council has the power to lay down a scheme which would take in the recommendations, particularly of amendments Nos. 2 and 4. We are not saying that that is not possible within the terms of the Bill. But what is forgotten is that the education authority—the regional or islands council—has other responsibilities laid on it by clause 1. In clause 1 a duty is laid on the education authority to declare the number of pupils to be admitted to school or " a stage of education". Therefore, the education authority must first lay down the limit of the numbers of pupils admitted to a school or a stage of education.<br><br>
As an aside, I must say here that I strongly disagree with the Scottish Consumer Council, which recommends that if the regional or islands council is to lay down these limits it should have regard to the agreement reached between the teachers and the education authorities that 33 pupils to a class should be the standard. I hope that we shall not return to the days when we had one teacher to every 33 pupils. That would be a major step backwards. I cannot understand why the Consumer Council, which I understood to be a forward-looking organisation, has suggested that that criterion should be applied by an education authority when laying down the limit of the number of pupils to be admitted to a school or a stage of education.<br><br>
Therefore, the parents do not first apply to have their children admitted to a particular school or stage of education. The first move is for the education authority to specify the number of pupils to be admitted to the school or the stage of education. The education committee—the Committee will run into great difficulty as we continue our consideration of the Bill, because of the confusion between the education authority and the education committee—will have to carry out the instructions of the education authority. It is within those limits that applications for parental choice and transfer of pupils can be made, and only within those limits. It would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
be far better if those applications were dealt with, and laid down in the Bill as such, by the schools council.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the Minister thinking aloud during our sitting last Thursday on the proposed discussion document that he is to publish about the powers, duties constitution and set-up of school councils. When that document is eventually published it will be interesting to see just how much of the Minister's thinking aloud is included. But the truth is that we are not yet at that stage. There is no discussion document. We have not yet reached the stage of discussing the future of schools councils. We are now discussing what happens when parents apply to have their children enrolled at a certain school as opposed to another.<br><br>
That application goes not to the education committee but to the education authority. In the case of Central region 36 councillors will be considering an application from a parent about whether a child should be admitted to one school or another. But, because of the size of the region, most of the councillors considering that application cannot be expected to know the local circumstances of a particular school. I should not expect someone from near the border of the constituency of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) to know much about the schools in Grangemouth or Falkirk, and I should not condemn them for not knowing. But that is the ludicrous situation into which we are putting the regional authorities.<br><br>
Central region is not the best example to give. The constituency of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, which is in the Tayside region, is probably a better example, with massive rural land masses. It would be impossible for a regional councillor representing, say, Blairgowrie in the constituency of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire to know much about the schools in Dunblane. It is wrong to expect councillors to have that sort of knowledge of local conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend were to study the way in which education is run within the Dundee division of the Tayside region it would become apparent to him that those concerned do not have much idea of what goes on in Dundee itself. They have made two contradictory statements about nursery schools in the past two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should not become too involved in the subject of administration. Under the statute all education authorities are required to refer matters of education to the education committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right, Mr. Gourlay, and that is the point that I sought to make. An education authority is required to refer matters to the education committee, which is then required to refer its recommendations and decisions back to the education authority for ratification or rejection. I believe that, as we proceed with the Bill it will prove difficult to distinguish between the powers and functions of the two bodies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
I return to the point that I was making about local knowledge. I understood that that was the basis of the parents' charter, because parents were to be able to make application to have their children admitted to one school rather than another, and it was to be an entirely local approach. But that is not what will happen. Whenever parents make an application, that application does not go to someone with local knowledge—far from it. There is a strong possibility that it will go to someone who perhaps has local knowledge of his own area but certainly has no local knowledge of the area whence comes the application.<br><br>
It seems to be eminently sensible that the Opposition should do nothing to wreck the great pillar of virtue on which the Minister has built the Bill—the parents' charter. Indeed, we seek to strengthen the parents' charter and we say that when that application is made it ought to go to a local body. In this case, it should be the schools council, which has firsthand, intimate knowledge of the situation of the schools in the area for which it is responsible.<br><br>
I should have thought that in order to satisfy the criticisms of the Parent-Teacher Council and to take much of the sting out of the criticism now made of him and the Government for the way in which the parent' charter, far from giving additional rights to parents, is taking rights away from them—that criticism will become louder and more prolonged as we delve into every word, dot and comma of the Bill—the Minister would have grasped with both hands the very generous offer that we have made in amendments Nos. 2 and 4.<br><br>
I have already told the hon. Member for Dundee, East that it is not our intention to press amendment Nos. 1 and 3. We have listened to the arguments, which I suspect is the difference between the Opposition and Government sides of the Committee. We have a Whip who is prepared to allow us to listen to the arguments and come to a conclusion, whereas the Government side of the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to listen as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member never wants to be confused by the arguments. That is something I have come to realise in the few short months in which the hon. Gentleman has been here. He did not need to> draw attention to himself in that way.<br><br>
The Government side of the Committee is ruled by a tyrant of a Whip, an astonishingly aggressive, violent man, who is reliving his youth, when he used to batter everyone round the boxing ring. Now he has all his hon. Friends punch-drunk.<br><br>
The Opposition listen to the arguments, and we are persuaded by argument. The hon. Member for Dundee, East has persuaded us that we ought not to press the two amendments to which he referred. I hope that the same openness of approach will prevail on the Government side of the Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
11 am<br><br>
I know that I have expressed that hope since May 1979, and today it has proved a forlorn hope. But as hon. Members consider their majorities, and the day of reckoning draws near, there is always the chink of light that one might persuade Conservative hon. Members to vote sensibly rather than loyally. This is the first occasion in our consideration of the Bill when they have the opportunity to display some individuality, and not remain under the tyranny of the Whip, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who forbids his hon. Friends to speak during the Committee stage and rules the roost with an iron fist. He does not now have the decency even to cover the iron fist with a velvet glove.<br><br>
I hope that I have given sufficient time to the Minister, as I did when I persuaded him to change the order of consideration, to think out his position. He showed that he was prepared to be in charge of the Bill when altering the order of consideration and he has an opportunity to continue that approach, to be in charge of the Bill yet, again and to accept the two amendments which we intend otherwise to press to a division.<br><br>
We are prepared to seek to withdraw the other two amendments, for all the following good reasons: the difference between the education authority and the education committee; the lack of local knowledge; the fact that the schools council has all the local knowledge; that parents would feel more involved and confident that their applications would go to someone with local knowledge; the need to involve the schools councils more meaningfully in the so-called parents' charter; and the need for the Minister to deal with the severe criticism that he is now attracting to himself from all the educational bodies and parent-teacher organisations because the charter, far from giving parents additional rights, restricts the rights that they have had hitherto. For all those very good reasons, I hope that the Minister will say " Well, chaps, we see the sense of what you have suggested and we are prepared to accept the amendments. " In the marvellous spirit of compromise for which we are so well known, we are prepared to seek to withdraw the other two amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that we see the sense, not of all his argument but of the basic proposition that he put to the Committee in the sense that it is entirely in line with the argument that I put to the Commitee on the matter during my main interventions on Thursday and briefly this morning, on the point.<br><br>
It is because, first, there is agreement in the Committee that schools councils should be involved in the first sifting stage of a placing request and, secondly, because we do not wish there to be any impediment in the Bill that would prevent their being involved that we cannot accept the amendments. We agree with the spirit of the argument advanced by all the Opposition Members who have spoken, but find that we cannot accept the amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
ments, which in effect would be restrictive in regard to the first sifting process and would affect die duties of the education authorities. It is not the Bill which is restrictive in regard to schools councils but the amendments.<br><br>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that he appears to have overlooked what I said last Thursday:
<br><blockquote><p>"One of the fundamental principles of Education (Scotland) Acts is to lay down that it is for an education authority to secure adequate and efficient education for its area. It would be entirely inconsistent with that principle to introduce new provisions seeking to impose on delegate bodies the authority's specific duties. "—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 5 March 1981; c. 64.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman says that the education authority is required to refer to the education committee and the education committee has to remit back for ratification to the education authority. I remind the hon. Gentleman that education authorities have complete powers to delegate functions to schools councils. The proposed new section 28B says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p><i>(a)</i> publish or otherwise make available information as to their arrangements for certain matters. "</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that education authorities—in this case the regional and islands councils-—have complete power to delegate functions, but section 124 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this sub-section, 'referred' means remitted to the committee for consideration and report to the authority but without power to the committee to discharge any function on behalf of the authority."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the education authority cannot remit to the education committee with power to discharge that function.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the 1973 Act refers specifically to the education authority in this respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am looking at part VIII of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 which deals exclusively with education authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to that point later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not know?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I do not pretend to be able to reply to that point about the 1973 Act. I do not wish to mislead the Committee on that point; I will return to it later. Returning, however, to the Bill, I will say that it is clear that education authorities have power to delegate their functions to the schools councils, and under the proposed new section 28B of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 they will publish and make available to parents information about arrangements made for placing requests and advise them where applications should go in the first instance.<br><br>
I proceed to the question of local authorities and their concern about the use of school councils. I met the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities last Friday, and the point was raised then. I assured
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
it in only two or three minutes that authorities could continue without impediment to use school councils however they wished and to suit their own local circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) spoke of 36 members of an education authority considering a transfer request. That is precisely what we want to avoid. It happens at present in local authorities and I agree entirely with the criticism of that practice. The whole spirit of the Bill, and the way in which it is framed, will enable the matter to be dealt with in a much less formal way by people who know local circumstances, the problems and the schools involved and everything else that must be taken into account in making the first decision following a placing request. I do not think we need pursue that path, because of the arrangements that we are making in the Bill. I should like to comment on the statistics that were read out by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire concerning the first placing request at Strathclyde. I am delighted that local authorities are taking a liberal view of placing requests, and I congratulate every local authority which does so. I say the same to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), who was complimentary about Tayside. Any local authority which takes such a view has nothing to fear from the Bill, in which we merely lay down the rights and duties of both local authorities and parents. The way in which Strathclyde and Tayside operate would seem to me, in view of what both hon. Members have said, to fit in very well, at least in respect of the first request by parents who wish their child to go to a different school from that allocated by the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to tell us which of the other seven regional authorities, and three islands authorities, he would regard as following an illiberal policy? Which of them does he seek to bring to the path of righteousness with this Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer to consider this matter constructively, and refer to those authorities—I have already mentioned Strathclyde and Tayside—which are taking quite a liberal view on placing requests. But I would like to ensure that no more cases arise where a prolonged struggle takes place with a parent who has been satisfied, perhaps by a school's headmaster, that there is accommodation for the child, only to find that the procedure of an attendance order has to be gone through. It can take some months before a local authority decides to issue one and a case may then have to come before the sheriff court. In my constituency, in Edinburgh, and in other parts of the country this has caused great distress to the families involved. We certainly want to get away from that extreme course.<br><br>
I have said that the amendment will not deal with the principle about which Opposition Members have argued. Indeed, it would be restrictive to write " school council" into the Bill in the way proposed. School councils can be used, but it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
for the local authorities to decide the most convenient form—for parents as well as for themselves—in which the first placing request should be dealt with. For all those reasons, I suggest that the Opposition could happily and confidently seek to withdrawn the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we seek to withdraw the amendment, we should like the Minister to reconsider the matter, because we believe that some of the points raised have not been fully answered by him. We hope that the issue will be considered on Report. We should like the Minister to tell us specifically which areas of Scotland are not complying with the general thrust of the parents' charter. Perhaps those authorities will re-examine the position in the next few weeks before Report, so that they may be given a second chance. It seems that with a last throw, the Minister's colleague, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), is endeavouring to correct some of the excesses of the draconian legislation on local government finance and giving local authorities another chance.<br><br>
In respect of education and the parents' charter, cannot the Minister tell us which authorities are defaulting in regard to the charter's principles? Secondly, can he not give them another chance to bring their policy into line with what seems to be acceptable to more than half of Scotland—namely, Tayside and Strathclyde?.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we can alter the Bill's intention of laying down in legislation, so that there can be the minimum possible doubt, the rights of parents and the duties of local authorities with respect to school transfer requests, when parental choice is concerned. We are anxious to see the Bill on the statute book, because we believe that present legislation is far from satisfactory with regard to voluntary provision of parental choice and when cases come to the sheriff court, and so on. We believe that the legislative position needs to be clarified; that is the Bill's purpose.<br><br>
As far as he went, the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) was correct in his reference to the 1973 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay I realise that this may not be a point of order, as such, but I note that from time to time the Minister has pieces of paper passed to him from people whose function I am not quite sure about. Perhaps you could explain the purpose of those missives to me, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is really not a point of order but one of information. It is a well-known practice both in the House and in Committee that the civil servants in his Department acquaint the Minister with points about which he may not be aware at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not a point of order. I was lenient with the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) and gave him an answer. But I do not propose to accept any more points of order along those lines.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that under section 124 of the 1973 Act, which deals with the power to discharge functions, local authorities must refer to education committees.<br><br>
However, schedule 10 to the same Act provides for delegation. As the hon. Gentleman will know, delegation is different from reference. School councils or education committees that act as delegates carry out the functions, but the education authority retains legal responsibility for the discharge of the functions. Schedule 10 of the 1973 Act creates the powers for that delegation to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. That proves that the Minister's notes resemble those that I myself used to receive, saying " Keep talking until you get the right answer". That is an interesting piece of information for my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In case anyone has forgotten, I remind the Committee that the amendments refer to the desirability or otherwise of schools councils' opportunity to deal with placing requests being included in the statute. The Minister said earlier that there seemed to be a difference between certain Scottish education authorities with regard to their attitudes—liberal or otherwise—towards placing requests. Some authorities devolve such matters to schools councils; others do not. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether in his estimation the good authorities are those that devolve and the not-so-good those that do not, preferring to take such decisions centrally?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The drift of the hon. Gentleman's remarks is correct. The authorities with the best records in that respect appear to be those that use schools councils as the first step in the process. Those that cause the most complaints and dissatisfaction are those whose full education committee acts as the transfer committee and takes the decision centrally about a single request from a parent. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth referred to that, although he mentioned Central region, of which I make no criticism, as an example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, will the Minister accept our amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. What the Government wish to do is perfectly clear both from the Bill and from what I have said. We want the local authorities to pursue the simplest and most informal method of dealing with the first request from parents. Schools councils are not excluded by the Bill; indeed they are actively encouraged by all that has been said in the Committee, including my remarks. It is because there is no need for the amendments and

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
for the other reasons that I have explained, that we do not propose to accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to Government amendent No. 5—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay, We wish to move amendment No. 4 formally, having withdrawn amendment No. 1 with the Committee's permission, and not moved amendment No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the hon. Gentleman does not understand Committee procedure. When a group of amendments is selected, only the first amendment is moved. The Chair has the discretion to allow another amendment to be moved. I used that discretion when I allowed a Division on amendment No. 2. but as that amendment was defeated amendment No. 4 falls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Gourlay. During the whole debate my hon. Friends and I made it clear that we were anxious to vote on amendments Nos. 2 and 4. When requests for separate votes have been made, I have always found that, even though one amendment did not tie in with another, separate votes have been allowed. If that role is now to be changed so that when one amendment falls, other amendments will also fall, the Committee should be informed in Chairman's instructions before the start of the debate. The exact position would then be known. I put that point with great respect, and to seek your guidance, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am grateful for your guidance. However, I would understand your remarks if amendment No. 4. made no sense after the fall of amendment No. 2. But, if it were accepted by the Committee, amendment No. 4 would still make sense, because the parent would first make the request to the education authority and it would then be the duty of the authority or the school council to place the child according to the provisions of subsection (2). Although the Committee has already rejected amendment No. 2, that does not mean that amend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
ment No. 4 could not stand on its own. Therefore, I ask you, Mr. Gourlay, to allow us a Division on amendment No. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given my decision, and nothing has been said to cause me to depart from that. The ruling cannot be challenged. Amendment No. 1 was withdrawn. The Chair agreed to allow a Division on amendment No. 2 because the four amendments were grouped together and because two different principles were involved. But when amendment No. 2 was defeated, amendment No. 4 also fell in respect of a Division, because it did not make sense in the context of the clause. That is the Chair's ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Will you please clarify what will happen when we reach Government amendments Nos. 7 and 31 and our amendment No. 8, which are grouped together? If the same ruling is applied, and we assume that the same voting pattern will exist, will that mean that if Government Members vote for amendment No. 7, they will be also voting for amendment No. 8?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I anticipated the hon. Gentleman's point of order. Government amendments are in a different context from those of the Opposition in relation to being put to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear that I am not challenging your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. But we have now staggered into the most astonishing issue, and I should therefore be grateful if it could be clarified before the Committee proceeds further.<br><br>
This is the first time during my 10 years here that a matter of this sort has occurred. We are not consulted—as a Government Minister I was never consulted—about the way in which these amendments were selected. The Chairman's selection of the grouping of the amendments is decided by the Chairman and no one questions that. But now that the selection has been made, and one amendment in the group has been defeated, there is a ruling that because another amendment would not make sense of the Bill we are not allowed to have a vote on it.<br><br>
My understanding is that it is neither for the Chair—I know this might sound funny to some hon. Members—nor for the Opposition to make sense of a Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must intervene at this stage because the matter requires a little more clarification than I have already given. The Chairman's provisional selection of amendments is made by the Chair. But if the Government or Opposition are not entirely satisfied with the selection or the grouping they can always discuss the matter with the Chairman before the Committee commences. As a Chairman I am always willing to discuss groupings with the Opposition—and the Government, too, for that matter.<br><br>
However, once the grouping is finalised that is the order in which the amendments are taken, when the Chairman usually indicates what he is prepared
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
to do in the way of granting Divisions. It so happened that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) anticipated my views on the question of dividing on this group of amendments. Therefore, I did not formally state that I approved, but merely accepted the situation because the hon. Gentleman had assumed that he would get a Division on amendment No. 2 if he withdrew amendment No. 1. In fact, hon. Gentlmen were under a misapprehension because they spoke about withdrawing amendment Nos. 1 and 3 when amendment No. 3 was never moved and, therefore, did not need to be withdrawn. That is one of the misunderstandings which many Committee members appear to have on these matters.<br><br>
Rules are laid down in " Erskine May " which the Chairman must follow, and when an amendment is called for a division and falls a consequential amendment—I regard amendment No. 4 as consequential—cannot be voted upon. There cannot be any points of order on that ruling. If that ruling is to be challenged I must advise hon. Gentlemen that there is a method by which that can be done. I am ruling in accordance with the rules of the House, I must now proceed to amendment No. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I have made it explicit that I am not challenging your ruling. However, the point which has not yet been answered is that, if the Committee is to be placed in the position, surely we have a right to know about the grouping of amendments. For example, on the provisional selection of amendments for today, amendments Nos. 9 to 13 and 21 to 24 are grouped. We must know before we start that debate what will happen if we withdraw amendment No. 9 and press amendment No. 10. Alternatively, if one amendment falls on a vote, what will happen to the remainder of the amendments in the group?<br><br>
All my experience, both before and since I came to the House, is that if Chairman operate the approach that if an amendment is defeated on a vote further amendment falls because it is considered consequential, those considering the amendments have been in possession of that information before the debate started.<br><br>
I am sorry to continue at length but this is a most important point for the Government as well as the Opposition. If we discuss a group of amendments and are then suddenly told that because one amendment fails and another is regarded as consequential and, therefore, cannot be voted upon, we shall argue that every amendment should be considered on its own. We will not agree to the grouping of amendments if that is the way in which the Committee is to be conducted. We must sort out the matter now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the matter is perfectly clear, but I shall try to clarify it further as much as possible. When amendments are grouped, it is in order for hon. Gentlemen before debating them to tell the Chair which amendments they would prefer to have Divisions upon. The Chair will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
rule which amendments he would be willing to grant divisions upon. Selection and grouping of amendments ultimately rests with the Chair.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Sometimes Divisions are not allowed on amendments because they are consequential, or because the following amendment is inconsitent with the wording of the Bill as it has come from Second Reading or it has been altered by other amendments in Committee. The Chair must rule on those matters, and that is what I have done this morning. I have ruled in accordance with " Erskine May " and with the traditional rules of the House. There is nothing new about that; I have done that in every Committee that I have chaired so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do you, Mr. Gourlay, as Chairman of the Committee, consider that it might have been better for the Committee to be aware before the debate began that if amendment No. 2 fell, amendment No. 4 would be regarded as consequential? This is crucial to the burden of my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. I thought that I had made the matter clear. If, when there is a group of Opposition amendments to be discussed at one time, the hon. Gentleman leading the Opposition in Committee cares to come to the Chair either before the Committee starts its sitting—which would be preferable or during the Committee's discussions, the Chair would be perfectly willing to say which amendments can be divided on and which would be required to fall if certain amendments were not carried. The Chair gives the utmost co-operation to the Opposition in dealing with the grouping of amendments and with divisions. The Chair must be impartial. There is no question of the Chair's ruling out an amendment simply because it does not like that amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of Order. I would like to take you, Mr. Gourlay, through the stages from our point of view.<br><br>
Amendment No. 2 is concerned with the initial request which may go to thet education authority. Amendment No. 4 is concerned with how that request is dealt with. The acceptance by the Committee of Amendment No. 4 would not be inconsistent with the Bill. It would not create complications. With the greatest respect, Mr. Gourlay, the criteria which you apply should, in our consideration, be re-examined. The amendments have two separate purposes and the passage of amendment No. 4 would not result in any inconsistency in the Bill. I ask you, Mr Gourlay, to look at the matter again, because it is incorrect to take the two amendments to mean roughly the same thing.<br><br>
To sum up, amendment No. 2 deals with the initial request and amendment No. 4 concerns the consideration of that request. It is perfectly consistent for the education authority to receive the request and to pass it on either to another part of the education authority or to the school council.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point of order, but it is not a matter to be discussed in Committee by the Chair and the Opposition. All I say is that, following my reading of " Erkskine May ", my decision is based on the fact that the principle was discussed and decided by amendment No. 2, and although amendment No. 4 is slightly different, the principle is the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept any further points of order. I have clarified the situation, and I propose that we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Mr. Gourlay. We must accept your ruling that amendment No. 4 is consequential on amendment No. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. In using the word " consequential " I may have misled the Committee. In this case the question is one of inconsistency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite our private opinions, we must accept that ruling. I believe that there is a distinction between amendments Nos. 2 and 4, but I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. However, I and a number of my hon. Friends are still considerably confused. I should be grateful if you would clear up some of that confusion. As you know, I have been asked to act as Opposition Whip in the Committee, and therefore ask especially for your guidance on this matter.<br><br>
Did you, Mr. Gouray, say that you expect notice to be given whether we are to press amendments to a Division? That is an important matter, and strikes at the heart of our debates. Very often we do not know in advance which amendments we shall press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I see the hon. Gentleman's point. I have made it clear that the practice that I am operating operates also in the Chamber. As a former Deputy Speaker, I am very much aware of the practice, which is that when Opposition amendments are selected for debate as a group, if need be there is an informal discussion between the hon. Member leading for the Opposition and the Chairman about which amendments in the group qualify for separate Divisions. The Chair should give that information, although it does not necessarily have to be done informally or beforehand. However, the matter is normally decided before the debate commences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. We are anxious that the Bill should proceed. As a matter of courtesy I should tell you that we consider the matter to be of such fundamental importance, particularly for the rights of the Opposition, that we shall certainly be taking the matter to Mr. Speaker in order to obtain a ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must first acquaint the hon. Gentleman with the fact that Mr. Speaker has no authority over what happens in Committee. Secondly, what hon. Members are really trying to do is to challenge the ruling of the Chair. The Chair has discretion in the selection of the amendments in the first place, and therefore, once the amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
are grouped, the Chairman has to rule which amendments are entitled to Divisions. That ruling, as I see it, is made not according to whether there are too many or too few Divisions, but purely according to the various rulings in " Erskine May ".<br><br>
I hope that we may now proceed. I have clarified the matter beyond any shadow of doubt, as far as I can see. If there are any matters still in doubt perhaps hon. Members will see me afterwards, before our next sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I shall not have it said that I am challenging the ruling of the Chair. I merely say that I regard the matter as being of such fundamental importance to the work of the Opposition, who have a right and a duty to oppose, that I shall consider taking the matter to Mr. Speaker. You, Mr. Gourlay, advise me that Mr. Speaker has no authority over Committees, but surely there must be another House authority. I shall find out where that lies and shall take the matter on behalf of my hon. Friends to that other authority. That is not challenging your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, it is simply an expression of concern about the position in which the Opposition have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter is quite clear; the hon. Gentleman is dissatisfied with my ruling. Some of the remarks that have been made during the discussion amount in some ways to a challenge. I advise the hon. Gentleman that the person to whom he should refer is the Chairman of Ways and Means. Now may we proceed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to use the phrase " point of order" again, Mr. Gourlay, because you have made it clear that what we have been discussing is not a point of order. However, will you explain something for the benefit of the Opposition? I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) will be interested, too, as he is involved. I am not certain whether you cleared up the question raised by the reference by the hon. Member for Falkirk, Stir ling and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) to the group consisting of amendments Nos. 9 to 13 and Nos. 21 to 24. If there is a vote then, would that cover all the amendments Nos. 9 to 13 and 21 to 24? If so the hon. Member for Argyll would be in some difficulty—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not being fair either to the Committee or the Chair. I have already said three times that it is for the hon. Members leading the Opposition side of the Committee to discuss the grouping of amendments with the Chair either before the Committee meets or during the sitting. We can then come to an arrangement and the Chair will rule which amendments will give rise to Divisions. The fact that amendments are grouped does not automatically mean that there will be only one Division. It means, however, that there will not be a Division on every amendment. As I have said already, the selection of amendments is a matter for the Chair. Sometimes the Chair selects for debate as part of a group amendments that would not be selected were the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0056">Image</span>

Chair to decide that any debate should be on them as individual amendments.<br><br>
This is not a matter that we can discuss in Committee. We are now bound to proceed, and we must turn to Government amendment No. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There can be no further points of order. I have clarified the issue beyond any shadow of doubt, and I am not prepared to accept any further points of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless the hon. Gentleman has an entirely new point of order I cannot accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to delay the Committee in any way, Mr. Gourlay. The point of order that I am trying to raise is intended to show that there are both Opposition Back-Bench spokesmen—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order for the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may raise only genuine points of order. His last point of order was entirely bogus, and I am not prepared to accept it. The hon. Gentleman must therefore resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 5 in page 1, line 13, leave out " subsection (2) " and insert " subsections (2) and (3) ".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 29 and 30.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are drafting amendments designed to make it plain that the duty of an education authority to comply with a parent's placing request with reference to subsection (1) of new section 28A of the 1980 Act and the other provisions referred to, is subject not only to the provisions of subsection (2), which deals with the case
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a placing request relates to two or more schools ",</p></blockquote>
but also to those of subsection (3), which specifies grounds on which an authority may refuse the request.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 18, leave out " or more ".<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is simple and straightforward. It is to limit parents' range of options under the so-called parents' charter. We do not consider it desirable that parents should have an unlimited range of choices. Two would be a reasonable number of schools to specify. The reasons why parents decide that the local school is inadequate for their childrens' education are based on a variety of criteria. We shall consider those later. Suffice to say at present that the reasons for parents' desire to send their children to schools other than the local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
school in whose catchment area they live are many and varied. One may be that parents simply do not like the local school, and would prefer to send their children to any establishment other than that one. However, they then submit applications to the authority based on a league table drawn up on highly subjective criteria.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has already admitted that there have been cases of parents withdrawing their children from school because they did not want them to go to the local school, and waiting until the local authority had set its wheels in motion. The Minister said that he did not want any more cases of prolonged struggle involving the use of attendance orders and, ultimately, sheriff court proceedings.<br><br>
I submit that if we afford parents an unlimited range of opportunities to have their children considered for virtually every school in an authority, it would not guarantee that the child would get any education but it would certainly afford parents the opportunity to keep the child away from school—the school that they did not want him or her to attend—for as long as possible. That is most undesirable.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I recognise that there are some instances, which are considered in the Bill, when parents may have difficulty in justifying to individual headmasters the desirability of having their child in a particular institution. That reminds me of a famous record by Peter Sellers which contains an interview between a parent and a public school headmaster in which the parent explains that he has tried to enter the child for Eton, Winchester, Harrow and Fettes, but the headmaster stops the parent in mid-sentence and says, " Oh, you have been hawking the brat." I believe that it would be possible for parents to hawk their children round local authority schools with the express purpose of keeping them away from those schools to which they are supposed to go under the existing zoning arrangements.<br><br>
Consequently, we frankly seek to limit the rights of parents under the parents' charter because we believe that sometimes youngsters may be denied education because of what may be parents' capricious views. On Second Reading, I said that there were certain aspects of the parents' charter that could be better regarded as a moaner's manifesto. The right of parents to make an unlimited number of applications on behalf of their children is most unsatisfactory.<br><br>
If parents find it impossible to enter their child into one school, it is fair enough for them to have another option when special educational needs are involved. I am not talking in terms of Warnock but in connection with children who require some form of education which is not possible in the first option. When that happens, it is not unreasonable to expect local authorities to provide a second choice, but the matter should go no further. There should be a limit because of the burdens that are being imposed on local authorities and because of the possibility of parents' capricious reasons. Therefore we suggest that the choice is limited to two schools.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
I shall not continue that argument now, because I am sure that some of my hon. Friends wish to speak. However, I must point out that in the light of the defeat of amendment No. 2—we were not allowed to test the Committee's feeling on amendment No. 4 to find out whether we would have been defeated, although I suppose that that would have happened—we cannot guarantee that the treatment of applications will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Applications may be put in over some months—that is, the first is rejected so that parents then send in a second, then a third and then a fourth.<br><br>
The Opposition make no apologies for saying that the parents' charter must contain restrictions, because the educational welfare of the children must be considered as well as parents' wishes. Parents may wish to keep their children away from schools. We recognise that the authorities have certain responsibilities and courses of action open to them to bring the courts into play, but this can be lengthy and time-consuming. The Minister has put down many other restrictions on the element of parental choice, but we believe that the choice of two schools is adequate because it would not unduly limit the time during which a child would be out of school. It would also enable the local authority to deal with matters as expeditiously as possible. For those reasons we have tabled the amendment and we shall seek leave to put it to the vote at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the hon. Member's important point about children being trailed around schools in the way that he described when he moved his amendment. I believe that his closing words were that these requests should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. That is a theme which I used in previous debates. I said that I was most anxious that we should find a system of allowing the maximum possible parental choice, at the same minimising the burden on parents and local authorities and making the decision-making process as informal, as straight-forwards and as easy as possible for both parties.<br><br>
However, I have carefully listened to what the hon. Gentleman said and I am most anxious that we should have a reasoned debate on these matters. If one accepts the principle of parental choice, which the Committee appears to do, clearly it is our objective to get the legislation as well defined and as straightforward as possible.<br><br>
Perhaps I can explain to the hon. Gentleman why it is not necessary to restrict the number of schools. I shall explain the way in which it will work for a parent who applies for two or more schools, as the Bill permits. The authority can then decide which of the schools it will reject and whether it will accept the first or the second choice. The first is the named school.<br><br>
What concerns the Committee is whether, if the first school is not acceptable, the parent can go through the whole appeals procedure for the second, third and fourth school and so on—that is, to go to the appeals committee and after that to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
the sheriff. That is not the case because the provisions of new section 28C(3) prevent a further reference to appeal in respect of a child for a further 12 months. But in dealing with multiple applications I should expect authorities—indeed, I hope to advise them so—that as a matter of good administrative practice, they should give parents an idea of their likely decision on the other schools listed in their application so that the parents can decide which application they wish to pursue to the appeal stage.<br><br>
In other words, the local authority will consider a multiple request and if it rejects, say, the first two in that request, it might show that it would be prepared to admit the child to the third school. The parents would then know which to pursue and whether to accept the third choice or go through the appeal process on the first named school. That is the most flexible way of dealing with the matter. It is helpful to parents that the local authorities should advise them on how they will deal with such multiple requests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to get one point clear. What role will the school council play in those local authorities where school councils are given the first opportunity to consider an application—for example, in Strathclyde and Tayside?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the first sifting process, if the school council found that it could not meet the first school requested by the parents, it would be able to make inquiries on the prospects of the child being admitted to the second, third or fourth school and advise the parents accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that reply absolutely incredible. I had some reservations about an amendment, which I admit my name was on, in that on reading the rest of the clause I felt that, in a sense, the phrase " two or more " was not necessary because the clause states that it shall be the duty of an education authority to take the first school and call it the specified school if there are two or more. The Minister said that a local authority should break the law. He said that when a local authority receives a written request from a parent listing two, three, four or more schools it should go back to the parent and ask " Which one do you really want and which would you push right to an appeal in order to get? Is it school No. 1, 2, 3 or 4? ".<br><br>
That was my understanding of what the Minister said, but that may be because his advisers were on strike and his advice yesterday was not as good as it should have been because they were not there to advise him. I understood him to say that the authority could go back to the parent and say " You may choose any of these schools." But that is not what the clause states.<br><br>
The clause states quite clearly that it shall be the first school on the request that becomes the specified school in terms of parental choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple point is that when an education authority turns down the specified school and there is a multiple request from the parent,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
surely it is perfectly logical and helpful for that authority to advise the parent with which of the other schools listed by him he will be likely to be sucessful. In that event the parent may decide not to go through the appeal procedure in respect of the specified school but to apply again to the education authority and schools council and change his specified request at that early stage to one of the schools which the local authority has advised him is more likely to accept his child. There is a choice for the parent of whether to go through the appeal procedure or to say " Instead of going through all that procedure there is the likelihood of getting my boy into school B or C so I shall accept that."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I shall vote for our amendment because it is now absolutely clear that we are talking about hawking the children around schools to determine which school might best suit. If a local authority indicates that it might not allow the first school, the parent will be given the option to ask with which school further down his list he will be likely to be successful. I certainly do not believe that that is what parental choice should be about. In many instances, in my view, that would be in contradiction to the proposed new section 28A(3)(6)(iii) which says that it would:
<br><blockquote><p>"be seriously detrimental to the continuity of the child's education".</p></blockquote>
In many cases in Strathclyde, the range of options for choice open to a parent will be limited. In other areas it will be considerable. If one considers the secondary level in the city of Glasgow, one could argue that the choice for secondary schools is certainly across the whole of the south of Glasgow and that it would not be unreasonable for parents to elect for that option.<br><br>
However, to take the example of the town of Hamilton, in which I live, there are only two non-denominational secondary schools. The nearest secondary school outside the town is some distance away and it is my contention that for a parent to allow his child to go to that school would:
<br><blockquote><p>"be seriously detrimental to the continuity of the child's education".</p></blockquote>
because the distance to be travelled would be far too great. I believe that that could prove to affect the child's education because it would affect the amount of time he has for homework and other things if he arrives home later from school as a result of having to travel long distances.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Therefore, I believe that the request should be limited to two schools only. If the parent is refused both schools and goes to appeal in respect of one of them, then he will have to wait 12 months before he can reapply. If he feels so strongly that he wishes to apply for another school thereafter he can do so after 12 months. This is a very reasonable amendment in view of what the Minister said in reply to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill proceeds, its class nature is becoming more and more evident. A per-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
fect example is provided by our present debate: we are really discussing not parents' chance to choose, but the right of the hon. Member's friends on education authorities to select, under the present system. In fact, the Minister blew it when he said that, in the event of multiple applications, the education authority would indicate which of the schools listed' had been selected. What he was really saying was that there was no need for this part of the Bill, because the present regulations gave enough support to parents wanting to send their children to a particular school.<br><br>
The Minister really meant that there would be selection, based on the wishes not of parents but of education authorities. It will be based on their assessment, of where a child is to go. We are back to the nonsense of parental choice. When parents who wish to choose a school aproach the education authority they will be told that if they appeal it can be only in respect of one specified school. Most parents would accept that, not having the time, knowledge or expertise to fight it through some form of appeals system.<br><br>
Once again I must say that the real class nature of the Bill is coming out. Selection will be made, but not for the benefit of working-class parents; selection is already built into later parts of the Bill, which we will oppose as well.<br><br>
I think that the amendment has been very useful, but it would not improve the Bill very much. I would rather there had been no need for the amendment in the first place. Certainly, it has exposed the Minister and his Bill for what they really represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to add to the points made-by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross). Like him, I was concerned at the Minister's description of multiple applications. It appears to me that the obvious thing for a parent to do in this instance would be to perm his application—by the Jack Boulder method, perhaps—and say that after schools Nos. 1 and 2, there could be no further consecutive number appeals. If 10 schools were covered in that fashion, 45 doubles would be possible—as well as Heaven knows how many trebles and four accumulators.<br><br>
An intelligent and articulate parent would use this method, but someone else who was not quite up to it might select three schools and then be told by the authority that he had been refused his first two choices but would be allowed his third or fourth. He would have to choose between accepting that for his child and taking the opportunity to appeal for one of his first two choices. The logical next step would be to advise the parent that by appealing he might well forfeit his third choice, and that sort of skilful pressure will be applied to parents to deny them the freedom of choice which it is argued, the Bill will give them.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West for revealing what is really meant by multiple applications. As we delve into the archives the class differences are at last beginning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
to emerge, and will undoubtedly become even clearer as the Bill proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Either the Minister does not understand his own Bill, or something has gone wrong with his explanations. They do not quite fit in with the terms of the Bill. The amendment concerns multiple applications, but I do not think that is what we are discussing.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) used the phrase " seeking to restrict parents' choice. " But, in fact, we are trying to define more clearly the possibilities of parents having their child admitted to a school. We are really talking not about multiple applications but about multiple rejections.<br><br>
It is clear from the legislation before us that there is no opportunity for an education authority to say to a parent " You had better not put that school down as your first choice, because you would have no chance of success. " The terms of the Bill are specific. When a parent makes a multiple application the Bill places an obligation on the education authority to regard the first school on the application as the specified school, which is a very important phrase.<br><br>
Let us consider proposed new section 28C of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. One of the problems of clause 1 is that, if such questions are not raised as we go through the amendments, by the time we come to clause stand part—just before the Whitsun Recess!—the piling-up of questions will be enormous. Therefore, I intend to take every opportunity as we go through the Bill to have the various subsections explained. Proposed new section 28C refers to the appeals procedure with regard to multiple applications. In that section the only application that a parent can process to the bitter end—that is, before the Sheriff—is that based on the specified school.<br><br>
The Minister intervened to say that there would be a 12-month lapse between the dismissal of an appeal and another appeal being made. But he was not talking about a 12-month lapse on a specified school application. For a specified school—in other words, the first school on the application—the parents, according to proposed new section 28F which deals with appeals to a Sheriff, would have a right of appeal, but for no other schools.<br><br>
As I understand the matter—no doubt the Minister will explain it to us—if parents make an application for their child to be admitted to four or five schools, it is only the first school on the application that they can take to' the ultimate conclusion of a Sheriff's appeal. For schools 2, 3, 4 and 5 there could be appeals only to the education authority. Those would be the subject of the 12-month rule, during which there could be no appeal under proposed new section 28C. That is very important.<br><br>
I turn to the purpose of the amendment. It is in parents' interests to' have spelt out in the legislation their exact rights, which I have just explained. Although " cheating " is perhaps too strong a word,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
it seems to us wrong for the Government to give parents the impression that, if they apply to have their child admitted to five different schools, each application will be given the same consideration as the first one—namely, the specified school—because that is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman's flow but the Opposition have raised an important point and I am glad of the opportunity to clarify it.<br><br>
What the hon. Gentleman says about the specified school is absolutely correct. The specified school applies where one goes to the appeal committee and, thereafter, to the sheriff. But before that stage there is an opportunity for some flexibility in the discussions that the parent has with the local authority in deciding which school he wishes his child to attend. There is flexibility in the choice of the specified school—[HON. MEMBERS: " Oh, No".] Oh yes. The parent specifies the school and is able to have second thoughts, after the first refusal from the local authority, on whether to apply again. The parents' may decide, having been turned down for the specified school, not to go through the whole procedure of appeal committee, or sheriff, if one of the other schools in the initial application to the local authority has been signalled as having a place for the child. It is only then that the specified school would change in that a fresh application would be made by the parent for that school—[HON. MEMBERS: " Ah ".]—and the school in that fresh application would be the specified school. That is making a fresh request. There is no limit to the number of requests that the parent can make to the local authority. But there is a limit, as hon. Members have pointed out, in the number of times that the parent can go> to the appeal committee. Surely it is in the interests of parents that they should be able to have a second thought on the specified school.<br><br>
I am sorry for that long intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a very good intervention. That may be the Minister's intention but that is not the purpose of the Bill. If that is the Minister's intention, he had better tell the Committee that he will come back on Report with major amendments to clause 1.<br><br>
Whether the Minister likes it or not, there is no education authority in Scotland, nor COSLA, nor any other body which has considered the Bill, that understands a multiple application can be made and once the specified school on that multiple application has been rejected the application can be withdrawn and a further application made with a new school at the top of the list which becomes the specified school, and that if that application is rejected it can be withdrawn and another multiple application can be made with a new school at the top of the list. That is absolute rubbish. It is not true. If that is the Minister's intention, my advice to him is to throw the Bill away because the Bill serves no purpose.<br><br>
There is nothing in the Bill that complies with what the Minister said. I shall quote from the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
because the Minister is having difficulty in reading it. New section 28A(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the parent of a child makes a written request to an education authority to place his child in the school specified in the request, being a school under their management, it shall be the duty "—</p></blockquote>
the Bill does not say it shall be the option—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the authority, subject to subsection (2) below, to place the child accordingly."</p></blockquote>
Section 28A(2), dealing with multiple aplications, again does not say that it shall be the option, but states:
<br><blockquote><p>"to whom it is made, the duty imposed by subsection (1) above shall apply in relation to the first mentioned such school, which shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the specified school."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that the application is made and then wee Johnny's mummy and daddy are sent for by the authority which says " Now Mr. and Mrs. Brown, your child has no chance of getting into that school but he has a reasonable chance of getting into that one "? So Mr. and Mrs. Brown can pursue their claim, and take it right to the sheriff, who might then say " Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, wee Johnny has no chance of getting into that school." They can then take the application away and put in another with a different specified school. Is that what the Minister is saying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is doing very well. I give him 6 out of 10 for his description of what would happen. But he got the critical point about the sheriff wrong. As I have already explained, we are talking about an informal arrangement. In any legal matter the parties involved have every opportunity and right to settle their differences and to reach an agreement outwith the court. That is precisely what can happen here. If the parents and the local authority can agree on the school to which the child is to be sent and, if in reaching that agreement, they do not have to take the matter any further, surely to goodness it is in the best interests of the parents and the local authority that that settlement should be allowed to stand.<br><br>
We are not interfering at that stage, and that is why in the debates on the previous amendments I was most anxious to leave out of the Bill any restriction as to how the first applications are dealt with by the education authority. It is most important for the arrangement to remain informal.<br><br>
I am sorry that my intervention has been so long, but I must repeat that when the parents and the local authority disagree over the specified school—namely, the first school that is requested—the appeal court and then the sheriff enter into the matter. Those provisions are triggered off when there is disagreement about the specified school.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter becomes more interesting. We are being told that, although the Bill has 21 clauses and nine schedules, we are legislating for informality. I have never heard of legislation being introduced to create informality.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
The Minister is getting into great difficulty and is discrediting his own legislation. I understood that the claims that were being made on behalf of this legislation were much greater than what we are now being told. He is now saying that parents can reach agreement. That is what happens at present. Parents go to Fife, to Central region and to Strathclyde and reach agreement. The figures that were produced this morning and on Second Reading prove that. So why are we wasting our time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But what happens when they do not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now we come to the point concerning a small number of parents who do not reach agreement. We are interested in them as well, and that is why we are anxious to press the amendment. I must put this on record, because the Minster will have to return to it on Report. He said that that small number could submit a multiple application despite what the Bill says. The Bill imposes a duty—there is no option, no choice at all—on the education authority to regard the first school in that multiple application as the specified school. Then the hon. Gentleman says that, once it is discovered that the child has no chance of entering the specified school, the parents can withdraw the application and put in a new application with another specified school. Once it is discovered that that also cannot be granted, the application is again withdrawn.<br><br>
That is an outrage. It is not what the legislation says at all. If that is what the Minister means, he will have to come back on Report with major amendments. I strongly suspect that those of his hon. Friends who are not at present dealing with their constituency correspondence must be very worried about the way in which he is now interpreting the Bill.<br><br>
We are dealing with the matter of specified schools and multiple-application placing requests. Subsection (4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In section 135(1) of the principle Act (interpretation) there shall be inserted at the appropriate respective places in alphabetical order the following definitions—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'placing request'…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'specified school'…"</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if we were told the appropriate place in section 135(1) of the principle Act in which to insert the two definitions that we are discussing, because section 135 of the Education (Scotland) Act is very long.<br><br>
I return to the main burden of our case on the amendment. As always is the case, Opposition table amendments, they are moved, we have discussions and, lo and behold, we uncover a real hornets' nest. The amendment has done that. It has uncovered the Minister's lack of understanding of his own Bill and the hornets' nest of how the Minister envisages the Bill will operate. He told us that we were legislating for informality, which is the most astonishing definition of legislation that I have ever heard.<br><br>
Only very small numbers of parents are involved. Nevertheless, we have the interests of minorities at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
heart and we are anxious that those parents should not be misled. But they will be misled, despite what the Minister said, because he knows perfectly well that what he described of parents putting in applications, withdrawing them almost at will, submitting new applications, withdrawing them and so on will have no chance of taking place. Therefore, we are anxious that parents should not be misled; we want clearly to define their rights. If our amendment were accepted, that would surely define more clearly to parents where they stood in relation to the mutlple-application aspect of the legislation.<br><br>
First, I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment, which would be very helpful to him. Secondly, I hope that he will say that, in view of the confusion that he has caused, he will return to the matter on Report. If we have many more difficulties with the Bill of the sort just created by the Minister we shall need about a week on Report to clear up all the other problems that have arisen as a result of the Minister's explanation of his own legislation.<br><br>
The confusion has not been caused by the Opposition. Our understanding of the Bill is infinitely greater than the Minister's; we have a far greater grasp of every word, dot and comma of the Bill than the Minister has. Therefore, he should tell the Committee that in view of that confusion he will return to the matter on Report in order to clarify much of what he said.<br><br>
If what the Minister said is the interpretation of the Bill, to my knowledge that is the first time that that sort of interpretation has been placed upon it. No one outside the House who has considered the Bill is aware of that, among all the organisations involved. If that is the Minister's interpretation of that aspect of the Bill, he had better make that clear by amendment on Report, because in three or four years' time no one will read what the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland happened to say on 10 March. Another Minister will make a speech later today in the House which may receive a little more attention. I would hate it if the Under-Secretary's words to the Committee today were buried in the Budget Statement.<br><br>
No one will say in two or three years' time " That is what the Minister meant this legislation to be." The courts will interpret the legislation not on the basis of the Minister's speech but on the basis of the drafting of the legislation. The Minister has an obligation to clarify that point by amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already seen an example of that, of which my hon. Friend is aware, during the passage of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. During that debate a certain interpretation was given by the Minister of the Murrayfield ban on drinks. Since then it has been given a different interpretation by the legal officers. It creates problems when Ministers give one interpretation of legislation in Committees and the courts and other people interpret the law as it stands on the statute book.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a very fair point that legislation is not what the Minister says it is. it is what the legislation says it is, and that is what will be tested in courts. We have been put in the greatest difficulty by what the Minister said and I plead with him to give the Committee an undertaking that he will return to this matter on Report. Notwithstanding that, I am not trying to trade off amendment No. 6 against an indication that this matter will be considered again on Report. We shall want to push for amendment No. 6 because we now think that it is even more important than it was when my hon. Friend moved it. I hope that I have persuaded the Minister to respond to me in the way that I just invited him to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly summarise the position because I think that the hon. Gentleman has made this situation rather complicated when it it quite straightforward. I assumed earlier that he understood how the first process would be dealt with—the first application to the local authority. As I have said repeatedly to the Committee, we want that to be as informal and as easy for parents as is possible. We realise that for many parents it is an important decision to make about their children's education. We want them to have as comfortable a discussion as possible with the local authority, the schools council or whoever they apply to in the first instance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the applications will be made only when there is a disagreement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The application can proceed in one of two ways. A parent might be advised by the local authority that his child will go to school A and the parent disagrees or the parent may, in advance of that advice, tell the local authority that he wishes his child to attend school B.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is correct that in advance of the advice a local authority agrees that a child can attend school B, no application will be made there either. Therefore, we are discussing only applications when a disagreement occurs. It is important to get that on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the point that I was trying to make during my previous interjections. Because at the first instance we want the arrangements to be as informal as possible, there may be a certain amount of bargaining. A parent may be determined not to send his child to school A and that may be the main motivation of the parent's request It might be the parent's dislike for school A, rather than any great desire to get his child to schools B or C, that motivates the request for a transfer in the first place. In that event the parent will discuss with the local authority, either by writing or verbally, the prospects of getting his child into a different school acceptable to the parent.<br><br>
Assuming, for the purposes of this discussion, that the request has been made in writing, the first school on the application form will be the specified
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
school. But if in an informal discussion with the local authority the parent accepts a place in another school, not the specified school he will be at liberty to do so. That is an informal arrangement which has been arrived at.<br><br>
However, where a parent decides to pursue his case through the appeal committee, and perhaps thereafter to the sheriff, it is important that at that point, for the purposes of the Bill, the first school mentioned will be the specified school. There must be no confusion between the parent and the local authority about which school has been specified in the appeal procedure, and thereafter perhaps to the sheriff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that there could be some difficulty in relation to multiple applications. Will the Minister explain whether the phrase " two or more schools" might apply when a parent make an application, not for school A in the catchment area but for school B, C or D—in other words, where the parent says to the education authority " I am not happy with my child going to school A because of transport difficulties, but schools B, C or D are within easy reach." There may be some other educational reason why the parent prefers them. Although that is a single application covering a multiple of schools, how would that be dealt with under the system suggested by the Minister?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the local authority could not satisfy the parent, and the parent intended to appeal, the local authority would have to establish with the parent which school—it would be only a single school—should go to the appeal committee. That becomes a specified school. Thereafter the procedures would take place based on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that a parent should not be entitled to a choice of more than one school? It would seem to be helpful both to the education authority and to the parents if parents were able to put into the machinery at an earlier stage that they had an objection to school A and a preference for more than one of the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what multiple requests are about. We assume that by submitting a multiple request a parent is showing an order of preference, but where the parent is dissatisfied with the result of that initial request to the local authority, and where that request goes forward to appeal, in the words of the Bill it is the first mentioned school which is treated as the specified school. That is the only school on which the appeal to the committee and then to the sheriff can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say why there should be only one school in these circumstances? If a parent objects to school A, but has a general inclination to send his child to school B, C or D, why should not that choice be put to the appeal committee to exercise its decision on the part of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
the parent? That general choice could then be taken to the sheriff. I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to allow the maximum amount of choice to parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are giving the maximum amount of choice to parents. We are giving them the opportunity to consider multiple requests at the first stage. But thereafter, when the legal process as laid down in the Bill takes effect, the parent has to decide on which school he intends to go to the appeal committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said—he also said it earlier to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)—-that it is for the authority and the parents to reach an agreement on which should be the specified school. That is not what the Bill says.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is confirming that that was the reply he received. The Minister has just said that it is for the parents to decide on which school they will appeal. The parents decide on which school they will appeal on the day that they submit the application—the school at the top of the list. It says that in the Bill. The Bill says that it is the duty of the education authority to regard the first mentioned school as the specified school. The deed is done when the application is in the post. Nothing can then be done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not as inflexible as the hon. Gentleman suggests. Local authorities, including Labour-controlled local authorities, work with parents in a wiser and much more helpful way.<br><br>
In section 28A there is a duty on the local authority to comply with the request subject to the various subsections in the Bill. The local authority must try to comply with that duty. But if, in complying with that duty, it is handling a multiple request, surely any local authority will try to satisfy the parent on another school. It is only if they fail to agree that the parent will pursue his appeal to the committee and to the sheriff on the specified school. The specified school will be either the first school in the list submitted, or another school, because the first list submitted will have been withdrawn and the parent will have made a second request to the local authority specifying a different school. That is then the school which will go forward for appeal.<br><br>
The parents are entitled to make as many requests, in the first instance to the local authority, as they wish. It is only after the local authority consideration has finished and the matter has gone on to the appeal committee and thereafter to the sheriff that the parents are constrained to one school—namely, the specified school—as named in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Clearly the Minister and the Committee are in the greatest difficulty about the interpretation of the clause. Would it be in order for me to suggest that the Committee should adjourn, so that the Minister can speak to his advisers? We are dealing with very important rights for parents. I suggest that with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
the greatest respect, Mr. Gourlay, and with no gimmicks. The Minister must clarify matters.<br><br>
It is no use the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) sniggering. We are talking about parents in his constituency who will be affected by the sort of rubbish that the Minister has been trotting out for the past 20 minutes. Unless the problem is sorted out now, those parents whom the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire hopes to represent for the rest of his useful life in Parliament will be the victims of the type of stuff that we have heard. Moreover, I put it to the Minister that he should discuss the matter with his advisers and come back to the Committee with a sensible explanation of his legislation. It is outrageous for the Committee to have been treated in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It is perfectly clear that the Minister is out of his depth. I referred to that possibility earlier, particularly with regard to the legal complexities in the drafting of the legislation. Is not this an appropriate moment to adjourn the Committee until Thursday, and under Standing Order No. 63 to invite the Solicitor-General for Scotland to give his views? Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman could do what the Minister has failed to do—namely, convince the Committee that the Bill is intelligible and that he understands what he is doing. However, I doubt whether we would catch him now. He is probably having his lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should proceed with the Bill; I am not prepared to accept the motion for the adjournment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I was trying to address the Committee when the hon. Gentleman made his point of order, which was quite bogus. The Government are not responsible for Opposition Members being unable to understand the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his bogus point of order, the hon. Gentleman was anxious for me to take advice. I can assure the Committee and the hon. Gentleman that I have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for an hon. Member to refer to a point of order made by another as " bogus "? Surely, Mr. Gourlay, it is your responsibility to adjudicate on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I accept a point of order, it remains in order unless I indicate that it is bogus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Opposition have decided—for whatever reason—to refuse to understand the simple process of negotiation and consultation between parents and local authorities in respect of the first choice. The Bill is perfectly straightforward about that when it mentions the "specified school" case which can go to the appeal committee and then to the sheriff. But the parents will decide on which school the appeal will be made. I note that the hon. Member for Dundee, East is shaking his head. He asked " Why not more than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
one school? ", to which the simple answer is that a child can go to only one school at a time—and that is die school over which the appeal is being made. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should like to hear the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. Although I may be in danger of being called into order because of constant repetition, I shall take that risk and clearly restate how the Bill will operate.<br><br>
In the first instance, parents will apply to the local authority for their child to go to school. If it is a multiple request, the first school on the list will be—for the purposes of the legislation, if any further proceedings take place under it—the specified school.<br><br>
There is nothing rigid or fixed at that stage. The parent and the local authority are free to discuss the position. A parent might accept a school which is not the first school on his list. It might be his second or third choice.<br><br>
If the parent insists that the first school on his list is die one to which he wants to send his child and the local authority refuses, that is the specified school for the purposes of going to the appeal committee and to the sheriff. In the event of those approaches failing, the parent is barred from going again to the appeal committee and the sheriff for a period of 12 months, but not from making a further request to the local authority. He can ask the local authority for another school for his child as often as he likes, but he cannot take the procedure through the appeal committee and the sheriff.<br><br>
I believe that that procedure is completely' straightforward. The Opposition's refusal to accept it, to understand it or to believe in it, is something for which—happily—I have no responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has, in the last two minutes, shifted his ground quite substantially. Five or 10 minutes ago he said that by agreement with the local authority the parent could change the specified school.<br><br>
The record of this debate, when it is read on Thursday, will show that the Minister said that parents could change their specified school. That is not what the Minister has said in the last two minutes. He has shifted his ground because he has been given the advice that I suspected he should have been reading earlier—that the school on the application is the specified school the minute the application goes into the post.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I want the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind is that that is not a position in which the parent is stuck for ever more. There is room, for negotiation and consultation with the local authority at that point which may lead to a change in the specified school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So, " That may change the specified school" says the Minister. That is a very important point, because parents will be trapped. At present, after the application has been submitted,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
with a duty placed on the local authority to regard the first-named school as the specified school, there is room for flexibility. But there is no flexibility in the Bill. If an education authority seeks to use it, it can refuse to discuss with the parents what the specified school should be. The authority can say " That is the Bill and it says that it is a duty on us to regard the first-named school in your multiple application as the specified school."<br><br>
The Minister is saying now that an education authority can say to a parent " You have absolutely no chance with that specified school, so' our advice is to take school number three on your application and make that the specified school." But why would the parent make that the specified school if the education authority said that there was a chance of getting the child in there anyway? There would be no need to make that the specified school.<br><br>
The confusion that the Minister has added to this legislation today has been enormous, and in years to come he will live to regret it. It does the Minister no credit to try to> heap blame on the Opposition because we have been able to drag from- him this confused kind of explanation of how he sees his legislation working.<br><br>
In my usual generous moments I say to the Minister that we are prepared to accept his explanation and we give him notice that we shall table an amendment on Report to implement exactly what he is saying. We shall then test whether he is sincere—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should put the amendment down today for Thursday.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife-Central (Mr. Hamilton), drawing on all the valuable experience on which we depend, has advised us that we should table the amendment today for Thursday. We shall do so and test the Minister's sincerity and the sincerity of his Back Benchers who have been sitting nodding in agreement with everything that he said, even when he contradicted himself. We shall test the Minister's sincerity.<br><br>
If the Bill is supposed to say what the Minister says that is supposed to say, it needs to be amended. We shall have tabled a suitable amendment by Thursday, and we shall be able to see whether the Minister is sincere in saying that that is how he sees the Bill working.<br><br>
In the meantime, I advise all my hon. Friends—and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), too—that in view of what the Minister has said, we must press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this is a point of order, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that you will give me your opinion on that. I believe that if we put down an amendment affecting the financial effects of a Bill that has already been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
passed by the House, you, rightly would not accept it. However, on page v, under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Financial Effects of the Bill"</p></blockquote>
we read
<br><blockquote><p>"It is estimated that additional expenditure of about £100,000 in 1981-82 and about £300,000 in subsequent years could be involved for authorities in connection with publicity for school admission arrangements and the setting up of appeal committees."</p></blockquote>
If we accept the explanation of how the system will operate given by the Minister this morning, local authorities will be involved in the employment of extra staff to do all that informal negotiating, to go through everything three or four times before coming up with the final decision about the choice of school. Some examination by the local authority of each school in turn will be involved. Carrying out such a procedure as the Minister interprets it would involve extra staff. Surely in that case the Minister is suggesting extra finance in addition to that which has been approved by the House. Is not part of the Bill therefore out of order, because what the Minister has said severely disrupts the financial arrangements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman would speak to the amendment. The point that he has raised is not a matter for the Chair at this stage.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7 in page 2, leave out lines 17 and 18 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(i) make it necessary for the authority to take an additional teacher into employment; ".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 17, after " extra", insert " class or specialist" and Government amendment No. 31.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Government amendments is to make clear one of the grounds on which an education authority's duty to comply with a placing request is disapplied under the provisions specified in new section 28A(3)(Z>)(i) and in schedule 3, paragraph 3. The Scottish Consumer Council has suggested to me that the provisions as at present drafted are open to the interpretation that the duty to comply would be disapplied where the authority had been required by the circumstances of a case merely to move a teacher from one school to another.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
That, of course, is not our intention. The intention is to relieve an authority of its duty to comply with a placing request where compliance would involve the authority in taking an additional teacher into its employment.<br><br>
To put the matter beyond doubt, therefore, this amendment adjusts the drafting to make it plain that an authority will be able to refuse a placing request under this particular provision only where acceding to the request would require the authority to employ an additional teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 8.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that he is speaking to amendment No. 8, but he is not moving it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that at some stage we shall have an opportunity to vote on it, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should point out, in case there is any misunderstanding, that if amendment No. 7 is carried, amendment No. 8 automatically falls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for clarifying the position. I thought that you would say that, but in the light of our previous discussion I felt it would be helpful to have it confirmed.<br><br>
It had been our intention to seek to clarify what we consider a vague part of the clause. We make no bones about the fact that we do not regard unlimited choice for parents under the parental charter as being desirable. We feel that the children who are at present in school must be protected, too. It is not just the moaning parents or the alienated parents for whom we are legislating. We must protect the rights of all children.<br><br>
With a Government who are starving local authorities of the money with which to provide an adequate educational service, safeguards must be introduced. Our amendment seeks to introduce such a safeguard. We seek to limit the width of the parents' charter and want to make it clear that in talking about teachers we are referring not only to class teachers, but to specialist teachers, such as remedial teachers, who, in the primary sector, are often periportetic. We are talking about the specialist teachers who provide music lessons which we have heard in the past few weeks are as of right in certain parts of England, at least in the context of possibly charging for such education.<br><br>
We sought in our modest amendment to make sure that local authorities do not have to carry unnecessary burdens of expenditure or that unrealistic impositions are not forced onto the staffing arrangements in the schools concerned. We were frankly seeking on those grounds to limit the range of choice that parents would have. We felt that it was desirable and necessary to protect those children at present in school whose parents were satisfied with the education being received. Those parents are not making waves and are entitled to know that their children are receiving a reasonable education. Attempts by other parents to send their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
children to other schools should not interfere with that.<br><br>
However, the amendment has been superseded by Government amendments Nos. 7 and 31. The Government are showing once again that they have no real commitment to the wide-open parental choice which they heralded when they first introduced their parents' charter. But they are beginning to understand the educational and financial reasons why a parental charter, the like of which they paraded around the country, is nothing better than a delusion which is likely to interfere with the rights of parents whose children are in the local authority sector and attending the neighbourhood school.<br><br>
We may not have to push amendment No. 8, because Government amendment No. 7 may be carried—I imagine that it will be without support from anyone on the Opposition side—because the Government are entitled to their amendments. If amendment No. 8 has to fall, then fall it will. But we are intrigued to note that the Government have realised that to afford wide opportunities for parental choice is inconsistent with the best interests of those whose children are at present in local authority schools. It is inconsistent with the expenditure patterns that they are seeking to impose on local authorities and with the best interests of education. To that extent I suppose that we could say that the Government are beginning to learn something about the implications of unlimited and unfettered parental choice as envisaged in the original parents' charter, which was paraded as a breakthrough in education.<br><br>
To that extent we are not unhappy that amendment No. 8 is grouped with Government amendments Nos. 7 and 31, but we should like to think that at a later stage in our discussions the Minister will amplify his earlier remarks and explain why he has decided on this volte-face. We do not think that he has been nearly full enough in his explanation. We consider that amendment No. 7 is significant and has shown a major change in Government policy. I am sure that it does not necessarily enjoy the support of all Back Benchers.<br><br>
We are told on Second Reading that somewhere enshrined in our constitution was the inalienable right of parents to choose. We argued that that inalienable right was very dangerous, that it could interfere with the education of others, and that it had to have limitations. We are grateful in many respects for Government amendment No. 7, although we should probably have been happier with amendment No. 8, which is more explicit.<br><br>
Amendment No. 8 deals with the point about class teachers and specialist teachers. We recognise that there are probably a variety of headings under which they could have been designated, but in the light of the difficulties that we have already seen the Minister encounter with the Bill's terminology—</span></p>
