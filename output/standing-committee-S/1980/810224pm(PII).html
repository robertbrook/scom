	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) BULL</h1></div>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 29, line 5, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'21 A. In section 14(1X6) (termination of certain existing grants in respect of rural bus and ferry services)—
	<ol>

	<li>for the word "and" where it first occurs, there shall be substituted the words ") or under subsection (4) of that section (towards expenditure incurred".'</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to rectify a six-year-old drafting error, which has only recently come to light, in regard to subsidies to local authorities. I am sure that the Committee will agree that drafting errors, even if not discovered for six years, ought to be rectified. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 29, line 5, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>21B. In section 1 (appointment of licensing board by council of district or islands area)—
	<ol>
	<li>in subsection (3), after the word "divided" there shall be inserted the words "(or continue to be divided)";</li>
	<li>in each of subsections (6) and (7)—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>(i) after the word "elections", there shall be inserted the words "of those members—</li>

	<li>at the end there shall be added the words"; and</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(b) where a determination under subsection (3) above is made (whether or not at such meeting of the council as is mentioned in paragraph (a) above), either—</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<ol>
	<li>at the meeting at which the determination is made; or</li>
	<li>at the first meeting of the council held after such meeting as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (i) above"; and</li></ol></ol>
	<li>in subsection (11), for the words "a fresh" there shall be substituted the word "an".'</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment will correct an omission in section 1 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, under which licensing boards of districts, divisions and islands areas are constituted. Recently, the Western Isles council wished to merge the two divisional licensing boards within its area, and found that section 1 of the Act precluded it from doing so. The Act provides for areas to be divided for licensing purposes upon the determination of the district or islands council concerned, but not for existing divisions to be merged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no good reason why a council
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
cannot choose to reverse an earlier determination when circumstances demand, and the amendment will enable mergers to take place. The amendment also provides for the election of members to newly divided or merged licensing boards to take place at the same meeting of the parent council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 29, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'23A. In section 2—
	<ol>
	<li>in subsection (6) (time within which offer to sell dwelling house may be accepted by tenant)—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>after the word "shall" there shall be inserted the words ", subject to subsection (8) below,"; and</li>
	<li>in sub-paragraph (iv), for the words from "section" to "offer" there shall be substituted the words "subsection (2)(a)(i) of section 5 of this Act has been served on the landlord, the service of a relative offer, or refusal"; and</li></ol>
	<li>(b)in subsection (8) (notice of wish to have fixed price option), at the end there shall be added the following proviso—</li></ol>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"Provided that where, as regards the dwelling-house, the tenant has served a loan application in accordance with subsection (2)(")(ii) of section 5 of this Act, he shall be entitled (even if the said period of 2 years has expired) to serve a notice of acceptance on the landlord within 2 months of whichever is the later of—</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<ol>
	<li>the service of a relative offer, or refusal, of loan; or</li>
	<li>where section 5(7) of this Act is invoked, the decision of the court."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>23B. In section 5 (loan to assist tenant in purchase of dwelling-house)—
	<ol>
	<li>in paragraph (a) of subsection (2), the existing words from "within" to the end shall be sub-paragraph (i) of the paragraph and after that sub-paragraph there shall be inserted the word "or" and the following sub-paragraph—</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(ii) within one year and ten months after service of the application to purchase if the tenant has, in terms of section 2(8) of this Act, a fixed price option as regards the dwelling-house;"and</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>(b) in subsection (5), after the words "2(6)" there shall be inserted the words "or (8)".'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Although the amendment looks complicated because it deals with two of the most technical aspects of procedure relating to the right to buy under the Tenants Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, it boils down to one simple change which is to allow the tenant who qualifies for a fixed-price option to re-apply and make a second application for a loan when his financial circumstances improve. That is consistent with the original intention of the Act, and with the provisions in the legislation elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee on what may be a technical amendment, but as soon as we see the words "tenants' rights" cropping up, a sort of Pavlovian darkness comes over the brain, and I am unable to accept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Darkness; not light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I chose the word carefully and modestly. I am never certain that technical amendments in this field are really technical. I want to assure myself of this, particularly as it refers to one of the most remarkable provisions in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act—the right for a very small deposit—if I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
remember aright, it was £100—to acquire an option for a period of two years at the original fixed valuation. That is a remarkable bargain—I use the word in as neutral a way as I can manage—given the continuing escalation in property values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain a little more slowly what he is doing here? I understood him to mean that the amendment deals with the right to apply for a loan to the housing authority. Was there a technical reason why, if a loan application had been made originally, it could not be made again? Presumably if it was simply an option that was being bought, it could be bought without the necessity of applying for a loan. If the Minister can say a little more about what is involved, I shall shut up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an offer which I could not possibly refuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act as it stands provides for a tenant who has received an offer of loan from his landlord authority, which is insufficient to enable him to buy his house, to take out a fixed price option. However, section 5(2) of the Act unintentionally prohibits a tenant from making a second loan application when his financial circumstances improve. A tenant who saves up a deposit sufficient to enable him to buy with the benefit of the original offer is clearly not affected, but a tenant whose income increases would be prevented from applying for a larger loan. Therefore, unless he could save up a larger deposit or obtain finance from an outside source, he would not benefit from the option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can explain it, because I suspect that the hon Gentleman is still uncertain about the significance of what I am saying. If a tenant has applied to buy a house and he has applied for a loan, and he finds that, with the income that he has at the time of his application, he will not get a sufficiently large loan to enable him to purchase the house, he can take up a fixed price option. However, it is possible that before or when the fixed price option expires his income may have increased—he may have received a promotion or a wage increase or something of that kind—which would entitle him to a larger loan than the one for which he had originally applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For purely technical reasons, the tenant is unable under the present provisions of the Act to apply for the larger loan, not for any reason of policy or anything of that kind but because of the way in which the provision was drafted. It is to deal with that technical situation that the amendment is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was beautifully read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the second half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the second half was total extempore, and I am lost in admiration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me slightly illogical that, because a man's salary has risen, he needs a larger loan. The Minister said that the man would be in a position to apply for a larger loan than that to which he would have been entitled under his previous salary. Presumably under his previous salary he could not meet the gap between the loan and the price. That is the intention of the option.
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
Of course, the man might go to the option not intending to buy at that stage, but merely knowing that at some future date he will want to buy, and he wants the advantage of the two-year price freeze when all other property values are rising. That is the fundamental fallacy behind this option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If every circumstance in which the option were used were of the kind outlined by the Minister, I can see a case for it, but it will not be so. However, I am reasonably convinced that there is nothing sinister in the amendment and I do not intend to obstruct it further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I be to move amendment No. 125, in page 29, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'25 A. In section 15(1) (power of sheriff to adjourn proceedings for recovery of possession), for the word "6" there shall be substituted the word "7".'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is similar to an Opposition amendment moved during the Report stage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act. I said then that I was not convinced about the need for such an improvement. The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and his hon Friends placed great emphasis on their belief that it would facilitate the application of the Act. So strong was their feeling that it was natural that I should give their amendment further thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to say that I was wrong and the hon Gentleman was right. On balance it makes more sense to have a provision of the kind recommended by the hon Gentleman at that time. I could say that I am accepting an Opposition amendment in moving this amendment, albeit slightly later than the hon Gentleman intended. This is a drafting matter which meets the point raised by the hon Gentleman when we last considered these matteis. Naturally, in these circumstances, I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful. Our only regret is that a tabled amendment was not selected because it was similar to this one. It would have been so nice if the Minister had been able to rise and say that he accepted our amendment. It would have given an air of variety and surprise to our proceedings that would have titillated our jaded palates, even at this late hour. However, as the effect is the same, I shall make no further criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to a Government manuscript amendment, which I understand has been circulated to the Committee but which is so far not numbered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move as a manuscript amendment, in page 29, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"26. In section 27 (duty to publish rules governing housing lists etc.)—
	<ol>
	<li> after subsection (1) there shall be inserted the following subsection—</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>'(1A) It shall be the duty of every registered housing association (within the meaning of the Housing Act 1974) to send forthwith—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>to the Housing Corporation; and</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
	<li>to every islands, or district, council within whose area there are dwelling-houses let or to be let by the association under secure tenancies,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
a copy of, and of any alteration to, any rules which it may have governing such matters as are mentioned in paragraphs (a) to 	<i>(d)</i> of subsection (1) above; and the council shall publish, in accordance with subsection (2) below, the rules within six months of receiving such copy or, as the case may be, alteration,'; and </li></ol></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>in each of subsections (2) and (3), after the words 'subsection (1)' there shall be inserted the words 'or (1A)'."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment originally before the Committee was an amendment in the name of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) which sought to require publication of rules governing admission to waiting lists, allocation of houses, and so on, by housing associations in Scotland. We considered the hon Gentleman's amendment to be a perfectly reasonable and highly desirable proposition. However, the drafting was not appropriate and as we had the opportunity to invite the Chair to agree to a manuscript amendment which would have the desired effect, it seemed sensible to do that. I commend the manuscript amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish to complain that we had notice of this amendment only a couple of hours ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is purely a drafting amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not purely a drafting amendment; a principle is involved. I am not complaining, because the Opposition had tabled an amendment which had the same intention. Therefore, I presume that we can overlook the lack of time given to Members to study the Government amendment. It is basically a copy of the intention behind our amendment. Nevertheless, we should comment on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that the Government do not have a housing policy. They have neither the resources nor the will to do anything about the public sector. Although I support the Government amendment, I want to make it clear that the Committee has not examined adequately the developments taking place in housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We stress the need to have community-based housing associations, but there is a line to be drawn between a genuine community interest and something that becomes so parochial that it is not concerned with the wider implications of housing policy. While I agree with the need to publish the rights and responsibilities of transfers, admission of applicants to any housing list, priority of allocation of dwelling houses, transfer of tenants from dwelling houses owned by other bodies and exchange of dwelling houses, I should like the Minister to assure me that there has been adequate discussion with the Housing Corporation and with housing associations. I do not take this as a matter of personal affront, but I hoped that the housing association movement could be brought into the public ownership sector in Scotland in terms of the responsibilities placed upon local authorities. That is why I accept that the amendment has a sound principle behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the stage where we need some promotion outlet for the staff of housing associations, otherwise we shall attract young people into the housing association movement and they will become either
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
political revolutionaries or they will have no outlet. They should have been absorbed, or talks should have been started aimed at bringing them into the mainstream of housing management. But the Government, in their zeal to abolish quangos and for all sorts of other gimmicky reasons, have done away with the Housing Management Training Council. That would have been an ideal body to start talks with the Housing Corporation to bring in housing associations and to encourage staff to acquire qualifications. That would have afforded a greater degree of interchangeability between housing management staff, whether in new towns, local authorities or housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the greater accountability behind the amendment, but the Minister should give some assurance that there have been discussions with the Housing Corporation and the housing associations. I hope that he will go further and take on board the point I put to him, which is relevant to the success and future of housing associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to welcome the fact that the Minister has taken up the spirit of the amendment tabled by my hon Friends and myself and has embodied that in more skilful and, of course, inevitably more complicated wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps this is an example of my hon Friends and myself not having thought the matter through, but I am a little curious. I presume that the form of words which is used puts the housing corporation, in terms of publication of its rules governing housing lists and so on, in exactly the same position as a local housing authority. I notice in the terms of the manuscript amendment that there is a duty to send forthwith the rules to the housing corporation—I can well understand that—and to every island or district council. Again, 1 can see the point of their being informed. But it goes on to say that the island or district
	<br><blockquote><p>"council shall publish, in accordance with subsection (2) below, the rules within six months of receiving such copy".</p></blockquote>
I am not clear what the words "shall publish" mean in that context. Do they mean that they will have the rules available on application by any interested party, or is there something a little more positive in the words "shall publish"? Originally, I had merely envisaged that the rules should be available from the housing association for anyone who wished to ask for the rules as someone who might be interested in taking up accommodation under that housing association's development. Such a person could ask "What are your rules of allocation? I am an interested party and want to be informed." But the duty here is on the local authority—the district council in most cases—to receive a copy and publish it. That seems a little surprising. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in more general terms, there is a warm welcome for the provision, as I have indicated. The housing associations have become almost the principal agencies for the provision of sheltered accommodation. Local authorities have largely opted out of that sphere and left housing associations to act on their behalf. Certainly from my experience in my constituency of developments, for example, by the Bield housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
association, that of Hanover and a considerable number of the other larger organisations, I know that when they put up some of their splendid developments I greatly welcome them and admire the standard of accommodation that is provided; but, inevitably, they are very much oversubscribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to suggest for a moment that there is anything other than a lot of thought and, in most cases, a great deal of equity embodied in their approach to the allocation of that housing. For example, I know that in one of the Bield developments in Garscadden, those concerned went to a lot of trouble to try to get a mix in terms of health, previous area of origination and so on, to have a cross-section coming into the new development, and I do not necessarily quarrel with that. That information was very courteously and immediately given to me when I inquired, but I know that there was a great deal of doubt and some confusion about the exact basis on which the allocation was being carried out. There was an enormous oversubscription for the accommodation that was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is that sort of shortage, rules about allocation of flats become a matter for genuine public interest. It is absolutely right that housing associations should have to make that information available in the same way as a local authority that supplies housing opportunities, perhaps on a wider scale but in the same public sector as it presently has to do under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will comment briefly on the point I have raised. These late-night sessions seem to be very good for the Minister. He shows an amenability and general willingness to compromise— belatedly. I begin to worry that our civilised habit of allowing him to go home early has resulted in that spiky sort of party defences remaining in place. I only wish we had tried late-night sittings a little earlier. In any event, for what we are getting we ought to be grateful. The amendment is very much in line with our own thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the final remarks of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I gave the hon Gentleman an opportunity to have late-night sittings several weeks ago, but it did not appear that there was much support from both sides of the Committee to pursue that proposition.

The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) referred to the Housing Management Training Council. The main reason why that was not proceeded with was because the local authorities were unable or unwilling to give it any degree of financial support, although its responsibilities would have been for the training of their own staff. On that basis, the Government thought that it would be inappropriate to do the local authority's work for them, but what we have done is to provide a grant to the Institute of Housing, which now employs, on a Government grant, a person with a specific function of giving advice both to local authorities and to housing associations. There has been improvement here as a result of Government initiative.

The consequences of this amendment, which has the support of the Housing Corporation, are simply in relation to the publication of the rules referred to in the clause. The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
(Mr. Dewar) asked what the question of publication involves. It refers to publication in accordance with subsection (2) of section 27 of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which states that the rules to be published shall be, first, available for perusal; secondly, on sale at a reasonable price; and thirdly, available in summary form on request to members of the public at all reasonable times when they might be sought. They are the same principles that will apply to local authority rules of a similar kind. It seems sensible to put the matter on all fours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record and to clear my mind, will the Minister say what he expects to be included in the duty to publish rules governing housing lists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, it will include the same matters as are required of a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister go a little further? He said that the person responsible for housing management training works with the local authorities. Will he make it clear that this also includes the housing associations? It is vital that this should be brought in as soon as possible to the general housing management training set-up on a voluntary arrangement. I am sure that the Housing Corporation would back that up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon Gentleman specifically on this point. The training officer employed by the Institute of Housing as a result of the grant given by the Government devotes her energies to both local authority and housing association staff. Also, the housing associations are represented on the Institute of Housing's advisory committee on training matters. They are fully involved in this aspect of training, which I am sure will please the hon Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
matters. The substantive matters are to be found in the two new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first speak to new clause 10 and the abolition of the Scottish Food Hygiene Council. The organisation was founded in 1956. Although it started by providing much valuable service, more recently, because of other statutory requirements and by custom, there has been an increasing trend of direct consultation with the interests represented by the council, which accordingly no longer fulfils a distinctive or particularly useful role. Its abolition apparently will not leave a gap in the consultative coverage of interests affected by proposed food legislation. The council was told of the Government's intention to seek its abolition, and I understand that there has been no dissent. The proposal has also been intimated to the bodies represented on the council, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and no representations have been made to the Government opposing their intention on this matter. The council has not met for about three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the other organisation, the Advisory Council on Social Work, the amount of suitable work for the council to do has been steadily falling in recent years. My right hon Friend has therefore decided that it should be abolished at the earliest convenient date. The social work committee of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities together with those bodies covering the voluntary sector and other social work interests are now considered to provide adequate sources of practical and continuing advice on all aspects of social work in Scotland. There are a substantial number of organisations from which the Secretary of State will continue to receive advice on the matter. I mention just a few of them, although there are many others—the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, the British Association of Social Workers, the Residential Care Association and, in the voluntary sector, the Scottish Council of Social Service, the Scottish Voluntary Organisations Groups and a large number of other organisations, all of which are by no means reluctant to give advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Secretary of State announced his intention to seek the abolition of the group there have been no representations from COSLA or any other organisation trying to persuade him to change his mind. That would appear to confirm the Secretary of State's view that there is no continuing need for the group and that the advice which will be available to him from the many other sources to which I have referred will fully meet the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the Secretary of State introduced the two abolitions was noticeably different. The reasons given for one were totally different—understandably so—from those given for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the abolition of the Scottish Food Hygiene Council, I have no quarrel with that on the ground that, as the Minister stated, that there have been no meetings recently. In reply to questions about whether the bodies that nominate members to the council wanted it to continue, we were told that they did not want this. But the Minister did not say, in res-
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
pect of the Advisory Council on Social Work, whether specific requests had been made to the nominating bodies on the subject. That is an important difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also did not tell us whether the council had met in the past year or two, as the Scottish Food Hygiene Council clearly has not met. In fact, the Advisory Council on Social Work has met in the past few years, and in my submission it has done a valuable job. Indeed, it has made a number of suggestions to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to what I said in a previous discussion about the abolition of a quango. The sort of suggestions that the advisory council has made have not been very welcome to the Secretary of State. It has proposed increased expenditure on the care of the elderly, and the mentally handicapped, for example, which the Government may feel to be irresponsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Profligate!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has pointed out in some well-documented studies—indeed, there was a joint subcommittee with the Scottish Health Service Planning Council on the needs of the elderly—what should be done. Of course, the Government are embarrassed by that. They find it awkward, because the council has highlighted some of the gaps in provision and what the Government should do. The council has pointed that out in an independent, non-partisan and professional way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although our suggestions are on a factually correct basis, clearly the Under-Secretary will try to dismiss them as being partisan and made for propaganda purposes. No doubt that is partly true. But when proposals come from a distinguished body such as the advisory council, plainly they are much more impartial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) tell the Committee of any suggestions by the council that could not have been made by the other organisations which my hon Friend mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can, and I shall come to that shortly. The Under-Secretary dwelt at length on the alternative advice that can be given. He cited a number of examples, such as the Association of Directors of Social Services—which I know well—the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, the Residential Care Association, the Scottish Council of Social Services and the Scottish Voluntary Organisations Group, with which I was associated for a number of years in a previous incarnation. Indeed, I was involved in setting it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great importance of the Advisory Council on Social Work is that it is different from all those disparate groups because it does not represent simply one strand—that is, not just the voluntary organisations, the social services, residential care or the interests of directors of social services—but social work in Scotland as a whole, both statutory and voluntary, and brings them together. It considers matters in a co-ordinated and global way with regard to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With my radical views, I should have liked to see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
many of the council's recommendations go much further. But it has been a responsible body and has tempered the need which it clearly sees with the understanding that resources are limited. The council has come up with some good recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned at the way in which the Under-Secretary of State glossed over some aspects of the matter. He did not state—I hope that he will do so— when it had been publicly announced that the advisory council was to be abolished. Furthermore, he did not say that specific requests had gone to nominating bodies asking them whether they agreed with the winding-up of the council. He said that no representations had been made. But I suspect that a number of interested bodies —particularly local authorities—are preoccupied with what the Secretary of State is telling them about their budgets, and with their inability to carry out their statutory responsibilities because of the guidelines that are being forced on them, and the council is not in the forefront of their thinking at present when the Under-Secretary of State is trying to slip its abolition through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that a number of those bodies are reaching the stage when they feel that making representations to the Government is just a waste of time—particularly on such issues as the abolition of quangos. Until recently, the Government have seemed so resolute in their determination to carry out their policy that representations have been a total waste of time, and therefore some bodies have felt that it would not be worth while to make them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Under-Secretary has second thoughts on the matter and that he will answer my questions about when the announcement was made and whether specific requests have gone out. I suspect that the Minister—it is interesting that the proposal appears as a new clause, and not as part of the original Bill, as with the River Purification Advisory Committee—is trying to sneak the measure through with as little publicity as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I predict that there will be a great loss to social work in Scotland. Many in education and elsewhere—I do not know about housing, but I suspect that it will apply there as well—have envied the way in which the Advisory Council on Social Work brings together the statutory and voluntary interests, from the Islands in the north to the Borders in the south, to look after social work as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the issues that the council has been considering recently is the establishment of minimum standards in the provision of services—that is, home helps, meals on wheels, sheltered housing for the elderly, and so on. I understand why the Government are worried about any move towards that. They know that in almost every instance the provision that they are allowing for would make local authorities fall below the minimum standard. Therefore, the Government are worried about a nationally-agreed and recommended level for any service from a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a despicable little act by the Government. I say that from some experience of working professionally in the sphere of care of the elderly. They are trying to save a few thousand pounds by doing away with a body that has served us well. Indeed, I believe that it has not fully realised its potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some Conservative Members—I see a few
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
receptive glances in their eyes, if nothing else—will give thought to that, and bring pressure to bear on their Front Bench to reconsider the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the strictures that I placed upon the Minister with regard to clause 10, it would be churlish of me not to congratulate him on the two new clauses. The love of quangos of the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is well known, so there was nothing unexpected in his speech. The Minister is to be congratulated on looking in the local government area for quangos that have not proved themselves necessary. Nothing that the hon Member for South Ayrshire said revealed any suggestion that could not have been made by one of the other existing bodies. Will my hon Friend give some idea of the number of people involved, and the cost of running the committees, including the cost of administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That speech could have come only from the chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party. It was full of ideological prejudice and adds nothing to the debate that we expect in Committee. I shall compliment my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). Without wishing to be patronising, I must say that that was one of his better speeches. It was in order, and it was based on my hon Friend's considerable practical experience. I am not being funny, I am complimenting him. I thought for one horrible moment at the beginning that he would say that, because of the pollution of the river Girvan, so many anglers in the area were suffering from depression that he had asked the social work advisory committee to investigate the problem. I did not think that you, Mr. Gourlay, would take too kindly to his pursuing that line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriously, however, I say to the Minister that he should not be misled or attempt to mislead the Committee when he makes the same naive point as the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) and says that there are adequate bodies to give him advice— COSLA, directors of social work and so on. All those bodies have vested interests. If Ministers ask for the views of any of the organisations that the hon Gentleman mentioned, that is exactly what they will get— vested interests. One role of an advisory committee is to enable Ministers to use it to come up with recommendations on difficult problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such committees have a value, even to the Secretary of State. Yet they are to be abolished simply because of the dogma of a Member of Parliament who has run a successful campaign against quangos. In the absence of sound economic policies, and of any other policies, the Conservative Party and the Government have to go along with that gimmicky approach to kid on the troops in the Edinburgh, South Conservative Party— Heaven knows what they must be like if they are taken in by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that there are no representations does not impress me in the least. I do not say that this is the answer to all the problems, but I suggest to the Minister —in case he has forgotten 1 remind him that Report stage is still to come—one topical subject that could be remitted to such a body. That is the allegation made by Strathclyde regional council that the DHSS has put into the wastepaper bucket a lot of postcard claims for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
exceptional needs payments from people who were encouraged to submit them before November. That whole issue of whether the Government are right could be investigated by an objective body. The Government do not want claimants to take up their rights with the DHSS or anywhere else if it costs money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not have been better if the complaints had been sent to the ombudsman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter has not yet reached such a high level. Anyway, I cite that only as an example. I hope that the hon Gentleman will accept that. He often gives us the benefit of advice based on his experience in various areas. I should expect him to agree with me in that case. There is no doubt that many people do not know their rights to benefits, whether cash benefits or the provision of social work. What are the areas where there is no take-up of benefits or services? That is precisely the role for an impartial advisory body with no axes to grind, no vested interests. As my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire knows, the COSLA social work committee could not even agree with the housing committee. Sometimes we need someone to haud the bunnets, to stay slightly above the battle and give the Secretary of State objective advice
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act is relatively new in social work terms, and the Minister has not given us any evidence that the provision has not been working. Perhaps the body has run out of work because the Secretary of State has not given it any remit recently. A wee bit more thought should be given to the matter before we agree to the abolition of the body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my hon Friends have spoken with the benefit of great experience in the area of social work. 1 shall direct my remarks to new clause 10—the abolition of the Scottish Food Hygiene Council. It is not coincidental that at the outset of the Committee stage we received a memo on the Food Hygiene (Scotland) Regulations and the registration of food premises from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. That document makes depressing reading. This is a non-party issue because the delay in revising and modernising the regulations has meant that the matter has spilled over into the periods in office of Governments of different political persuasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter accompanying the document says that the Secretary of State has not given food hygiene the priority that it deserves. The document itself spells out how important it is that the preparation and sale of food should be carried out in the most hygienic conditions. The regulations used to achieve that end are the Food Hygiene (Scotland) Regulations 1959— they are more than 20 years old. The memo says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Regulations made in 1959 are not up to the task. The Scottish Institute of Environmental Health recognised this as far back as 1973, when they published a paper called 'Food Hygiene for the 80s'."</p></blockquote>
If the local authority finds premises that are not adequate, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"fails to persuade the owner of a business to bring about improvements to meet the standards of the Regulations, its only course of action"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
is to go to the sheriff court. That process is burdensome and expensive.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Registration would ensure that only businesses which were satisfactory from the point of view of food hygiene commenced selling food."</p></blockquote>
COSLA is asking for the Government to act, to bring in modern regulations to ensure that food is properly prepared and properly sold in hygienic conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am using the amendment as a peg on which to hang an argument. I am asking the Minister to use the opportunity to tell us what is in the Government's mind. Why are they now abolishing that body, which has presumably been in abeyance since 1977? The document says that the proposed new regulations were discussed at
	<br><blockquote><p>"a meeting in October 1977 between the Scottish Food Hygiene Council (the statutory body responsible for advising the Secretary of State but now in abeyance)".</p></blockquote>
That is the body that it is now proposed to abolish. It must have been in abeyance for some years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what part, if any, that body played in seeking to bring pressure to bear on the Secretary of State to modernise those food regulations. If its disappearance means that those modern regulations will be still further delayed, that is an additional and powerful argument why it should not be abolished. Any independent body which can bring pressure to bear on the Government to bring these regulations into the modern age is worthy of keeping until such time as the Government see fit to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view with great suspicion, with my hon Friend, the abolition of these bodies for abolition's sake. Everybody knows that I am not in favour of quangos. The hon Gentleman knows very well that I would abolish many more, including the Scottish Office, but the Government must convince us that the abolition of this body will not put back even further the modernisation of food hygiene regulations that have been in operation for over 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Riveting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not say "riveting". I notice the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) managed to read half of the Church of Scotland magazine 	<i>"Life and Work"</i> during the course of it. 1 hope that he has been morally improved. It will be a great comfort to the editor, Mr. Kernohan, to know that anyone reads it, even if under the duress of being trapped in the Committee stage of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the debate has been interesting because it has illustrated the important principle that the onus is on the Government to establish a case for abolishing bodies of this nature. I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) for raising this issue of the future of the Scottish Food Hygiene Council. It is not a very romantic area and I accept that it is often ignored. But we have had very positive recommendations—not, I accept, about the council itself but about the area in which the council operates, or could operate. The council has apparently been dormant for a number of years. One might reasonably assume that that meant there are no problems with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
food hygiene, and that there is a happy state of harmony between the Scottish Office at St. Andrew's House, the local authorities and, presumably, the trade. But we know from the representations which my hon Friend quoted that that is far from being the case. There is a very unhappy state of disharmony and disunity in this important sphere. COSLA, speaking for all local authorities, not just Labour-controlled authorities, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities are therefore left with unsatisfactory and in many respects out of date regulations to protect the public from the effects of unhygienic food."</p></blockquote>
I do not have the technical expertise to take sides on this issue and I have not had the opportunity of looking into it in any depth. I would be out of order if I invited the Committee to take sides on this argument. However, clearly, COSLA feels that it has been let down by central Government. Central Government presumably feel that COSLA is being over-protective and perhaps is insisting on dotting "i"s and stroking "t"s when it is not necessary. There is a case for thinking that the views of a food hygiene council operating with independent expertise within its membership might not be as redundant as the Minister makes out in tabling new clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same point arises on the registration of food premises. This power has existed since the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956, but apparently it has never been used, although I do not necessarily object to that. Perhaps the Minister is right in saying that there is no need for its use. But, again, COSLA— a powerful and informed pressure group with an executive arm in this sphere—says that that is not so and that it ought to have been used. COSLA heavily criticises the Under-Secretary's fellow Minister, the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), because he will not even meet it to discuss the matter. In such a situation—I do not enter into the rights and wrongs— it is extraordinary that at least a meeting has not been arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there not a role for the council? Could it not be resurrected rather than buried as is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of the Advisory Council, on Social Work, I cannot claim to have exactly the same level of personal experience as my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), but at one time— it is now rather ancient history—for about four or five years I operated uneasily on the fringes of the social work world. The body was then performing a useful function. I know nothing which suggests that it has suddenly become redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of social work administration and of social work priorities are still as pressing and as difficult to deal with as they have ever been. There is a case for having an advisory body which can act, to some extent, as honest broker in exchanging ideas and opinions and perhaps be a catalyst for discussion when, quite often, relations between local government and St. Andrew's House are not as easy and as straightforward as probably all Committee members would like them to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is a great temptation for the Minister to say that anybody such as a social work advisory council which believes in the value of social work is a dangerous organisation. But he must try to
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
put those prejudices on one side and recognise that there may be a role for this body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to think again about this matter. I am reluctant to suggest to my hon Friends that we should press the amendment to a Division, but if we do not get any change out of the Minister, particularly on the social work issue, we will divide the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has a long way to go—through Report and to another place and so on—and I suggest that a way out would be for the Minister to take this away and think about it. That would also give us a chance to talk to some of the nominating bodies ourselves to see whether the real fears expressed by my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire are more widely shared, not only by the advisory council itself but by those which it is supposed to serve and, I suspect, usefully serves at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a graceful concession by the Minister. This is a new clause; it was not an integral part of the original legislative strategy, and there is no reason why we should not have a breathing space for further consideration. When we have had time to talk and consult, the Opposition may not want to oppose the new clause if it is put down again in Report. We do not have closed minds on the issue. We do not believe in preserving councils for the sake of preservation— because they have been there, they shall be there always. We are not conservative in that sense. I would do some soundings with an open mind, but I am not prepared to acquiesce in the ending of this body now on the flimsy case made out by the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can inform my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that the Scottish Advisory Council on Social Work has a chairman and 18 members. The cost of that body is about £23,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the remarks of the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), which illustrated that the Opposition have not been able to bring forward any convincing reason for the retention of this organisation. The only example that the hon Gentleman sought to put before the Committee was a suggestion that the advisory council should look into the practice of the Department of Health and Social Security in throwing away forms that had been given to them. With due respect to the hon Gentleman, I hope that that was not meant as a serious suggestion. Nevertheless, it was the only suggestion that he put before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express no comment on what the Department of Health and Social Security may or may not have been doing in Strathclyde, but perhaps the hon Gentleman will wish to raise that matter with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security. However, it is not a matter for an advisory committee on social work, which is answerable to the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can be fairer than that. He is trying to make a slick point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action taken was taken by a social work department. Is the Minister now saying that that expenditure was illegal? 1 am suggesting that perhaps other social work departments in Scotland should do the same as Strathclyde. The Minister knows perfectly well the point of my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it should and perhaps it should not. But what we are talking about just now is not whether the social work department of Strathclyde was sensible or whether the Department of Health and Social Security was sensible, but whether the Advisory Council on Social Work should be abolished. I do not have to express a comment on the point raised by the hon Gentleman. It has nothing to do with the amendment before the Committee. Even if the council were to exist for the next 100 years, it is not remotely conceivable that this is a subject that it would choose to consider. Apart from anything else, this is a matter for the Department of Health and Social Security and not one for my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.

It is important to note that that was the example that the hon Gentleman chose. It illustrates that the advice that the Secretary of State for Scotland needs—we are talking about the Scottish Office and not the DHSS— is available from the many organisations which I listed. The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) should be aware that many of these organisations do not have a specialist interest. I should not have thought that the Scottish Council of Social Service would take kindly to the suggestion that it represents a specific sectional interest which is in some way narrower than the Advisory Council on Social Work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister concede that it represents voluntary organisations? That is separate from the statutory organisations represented through COSLA and the Association of Directors of Social Services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that. If that was the only organisation, the hon Gentleman might have a point. But 1 read out the names of seven organisations; I could read another dozen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They all have interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, they all have interests. That is what consultation is about. Any organisation which submits representations, either to this Committee or to anyone else, has an interest to put forward. That is why those organisations have a relevant interest in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) in regard to the Scottish Food Hygiene Council used the opportunity to bring into the debate the representations from COSLA on the registration of food premises. That does not arise directly out of the amendment, but the concept of statutory registration with closure of the business as the ultimate sanction has in any event been overtaken by the Control of rood Premises (Scotland) Act 1977, which allows the court to order the closure of a food business when the premises contravene the food hygiene regulations and there is a risk to public health. One statutory system providing for the closure of food businesses is enough at any one time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that COSLA has suggested that the 1977 Act is not operating satisfactorily, and the Government are willing to consider whether adjustments can be made to improve its effectiveness. With that in mind, the Scottish Home and Health Department has already been in touch with the Society of Directors of Environ
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
mental Health and the Crown Office, so action is taking place on that front. But, in any event, it does not arise out of the amendment before the Committee. I thought that the hon Gentleman would like to know the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to tempt the Under-Secretary out of order, but, in passing, will he not accept that there is a big distinction between registration of food premises, which ensures that before they can open and operate they are of a reasonable standard for the sale of food to the public, and waiting until an unsatisfactory situation has developed in a shop that is operating and then going to the courts to try to close retrospectively, as one might say? That is a much less satisfactory situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may or may not be so. No doubt there will be other opportunities when we can debate the matter. It may be a proper subject which should be debated so that matters can be clarified. However, I thought it was useful to give the present position on the consultations that the Scottish Home and Health Department is having with the Society of Directors of Environmental Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been no representations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I specifically asked when it was publicly announced by the Scottish Office that the Advisory Council on Social Work was to be abolished and whether a specific request was made to the nominating organisations to express their views on the proposed abolition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), who has responsibility for those matters, saw the advisory council in January and a public statement was made almost immediately after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Jauary this year—it was approximately a month ago. An announcement was made at that time and it was reported in the press. It presumably is known, as it is to the hon Gentleman himself, to the other interested bodies. All the members of the council know, of course, and no doubt, if they felt strongly about it, they would have ensured that representations were made by the interested bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is suggesting seriously that outside bodies do not know. The hon Gentleman himself said "Of course, they may know, but they have other matters on their minds at present." That does not suggest that they consider it an important issue. If they felt strongly about it, they would make representations to my right hon Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly pass on to my hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West, the points that have been raised in the Committee. But nothing that has been said today suggests that the absence of representations to the Secretary of State is anything other than an acquiescence in what is being proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is not an appropriate citation for the Bill.

I have already referred to the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act and to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act. I could equally refer to the so-called parents' charter, the Education Act, which has nothing to do with education at all. I feel that this Bill, rather than being cited as the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, could better be described as the local Democracy Destruction and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, or even the Lothian Region Emasculation Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important new clause, but I shall be brief, because this matter has been the subject of public debate and hon Members are probably well aware of the issues involved. The amendment looks very esoteric, but perhaps I may summarise it for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause contains a significant difference of approach to valuation for rating purposes of large industrial plants as between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. The introduction in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of changes in valuation regulations in 1960 and 1974 had the effect of excluding from valuation items of moveable plant and machinery. In Scotland, however, there has been no updating of the relevant legislation since 1902.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a consequence, because action wsa taken in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and not in Scotland, plan and machinery inside buildings is largely exempt throughout the United Kingdom from rates. Plant in the open air, however, is largely exempt in England and Wales but is highly rated in Scotland. It is an important matter. In certain cases the burden in Scotland can be as much as five times that in England and Wales, and the sums of money involved can be as much as £4- million between comparable plants north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of the anomaly are threefold. First, it is in principle highly undesirable that this state of affairs should exist. Successive Governments have tried to equalise the rating burden on manufacturing industry north and south of the border. That is, for example, why we have industrial derating in Scotland. Secondly, it means a higher cost burden on industries such as petrochemicals in Scotland, making them less competitive. Thirdly, such a burden clearly could be an element in an investment decision about the location of such a plant north or south of the border. I believe that we should do nothing artificially to discourage petrochemical and similar industries in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that the courts cannot provide a remedy for this anomaly. There has been a test case, and it is clear that legislation is necessary. I know that the Scottish Office has taken action. A review body was set up in 1979 under the working party on local government finance in Scotland. A test case was considered at

	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
Ardeer in Ayrshire which concluded that an anomaly existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, apart from the technical problems, which is the simple one of who pays. My hon Friend the Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) received representations on behalf of Fife regional council. There have been others from Falkirk district and from Central Region. There is the general financial problem that, if accepted the new clause would reduce the total rateable value in Scotland by 1.75 per cent., and there are specific problems also because we must recognise that individual authorities would suffer especially seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is accepted that there is an anomaly, the cost must be borne by other ratepayers or by central Government. Precedents suggest that financing changes in the rating system are met by central Government. The precedents are that in 1929 there was a substantial exemption of agriculture and industrial subjects from rating, in 1956 a full exemption of agriculture in Scotland, and, in 1974, plant and machinery of the kind we are discussing was exempted in England and Wales, the cost being met by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon Friend the Minister will accept fully the principle of the amendment. If he cannot accept it and take action now, I hope he will accept that there is a clear anomaly and that it is highly undesirable that these important industries should be rated more highly in Scotland than in England and Wales but that there is a difficulty over financing. Work has been done by the Scottish Office, and I hope that at least my hon Friend will be able to announce a clear timetable for a decision on this important matter. There would, if necessary, be an opportunity next session for him to bring forward the relevant clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise because I have received strong representations from an important company in my constituency that is engaged in the processing of Air Products. It has installed a considerable amount of plant in the constituency, and I am interested in the Government's reaction to new clause I for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there is a major problem in that if the Government were to take on board new Clause 1, it would cause new problems for some local authorities, not least my own. They would find themselves with a considerable cash shortfall, and I am interested in knowing the Government's reaction to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern, especially when companies are granted certain incentives to set up in Scotland, that they can be diminished by the fact that the companies then have to meet a rates burden that was not anticipated when they chose a Scottish location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am conscious that local authorities could find themselves in difficulty if they were not in receipt of the rates which they have been receiving from these companies, so I want to know exactly how the Government intend to deal with the problem. I hope that the Minister will undertake that if the new clause is accepted, the shortfall in rates for local authorities will be met by the Government in the rate support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend also seek an undertaking that before the Government do this, they have full consultation with COSLA and the other public bodies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important factor and I think that the widest possible consultation should take place with industry as well. I am sure that my hon Friend agrees that there should be consultation with the industries involved and with COSLA. I hope that it will be possible to find an answer to that problem, because we want to be able to attract industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have those assurances, I am sure that my hon Friends will wish to seek some sort of accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is probably one of the most important matters that we have considered in terms of job creation and the changes occurring in the Bill. I believe that we must examine it very seriously because, when companies in Scotland are forced to pay anything up to five times the valuation costs compared with elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and given the present scarcity of jobs in Scotland, we must do everything we can to encourage new companies to come in for inward investment. Probably what is more important is to encourage those companies already there to remain and not to remove their investment somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In simple layman's language, if those companies had a roof over their plant and machinery, probably they would be all right. That is rather sad, because BP tested the complaint before the land valuation appeals committee in Stirling in November 1980, proving that the present law is quite clear on that matter. The remedy for any changes lies here in Parliament and, if we are to have the same conditions in Scotland as those existing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Parliament— that means us—has to make the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman accept that, if we do that, the problem is that the rates burden becomes widespread over all the ratepayers within that local authority? That, too, is a situation which the hon Gentleman would wish to avoid, as I wish to avoid it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon Gentleman for that intervention. He came in just at the point when I was about to say that, of course, as with all such matters, there is a simple solution, because the plants in existence in Scotland and those which are envisaged—there are at least three others of that sort—will be substantial contributors to local rating, now and in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities have based their expenditure and all their plans on the fact that these companies exist and are substantial contributors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point I made at the beginning of my remarks. If we are to encourage inward investment in that type of industry in Scotland, something has to be changed, and Parliament and the Government will have to consider ways in which that can be achieved so that the effects can be mitigated elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As local Members concerned with the BP and ICI interests in the new clause, my hon Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and I have had some discussions not only with BP and ICI but with the Central Region and Falkirk district. I wish to refer to some of the submissions we have received from some of those local authorities because their plight is central to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) has the firm of Air

Products in his constituency, but I believe that primarily the interests of ICI and BP are behind the new clause. I believe that it is fair to say that in some respects the view expressed by the Central Region finance depart ment, which called the clause special pleading by vested interests, was not a jaundiced view. Certainly, had BP and ICI been doing better in earlier days, they may well not have troubled about that. One of the regular appearances at rate payment times was a photograph published in the 	<i>Falkirk Herald</i> of the biggest cheque being paid by BP to Central Region. There was a time when BP took some pride in paying rates, which may seem rather strange as a PR exercise. In some respects, the firm is now being hoisted with its own petard. Certainly, the financial difficulties in which it finds itself at present force BP to look for ways of making savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i> —</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is concerned with the rating of certain industrial property. There is certainly no dispute on either side of the Committee that there is an anomaly in the law of Scotland compared with the law south of the border which, in the eyes of industry, has led to a considerable disadvantage to industrial concerns operating in Scotland. We know that British Petroleum at Grangemouth and one or two other concerns have drawn hon Members' attention to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the coin is that any substantial change that affected industry would have a considerable on-going effect for the local authorities in whose areas these industrial plants are to be found and could lead to their losing a substantial amount of assets, which could have considerable implications for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say to my hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) and to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who I know is concerned in this matter on behalf of his local authority, that we are conscious of the problems which could arise for local authorities if a serious change of this nature were to be introduced. Any hurried changes to Scottish valuation law could well upset the balance achieved by derating and put Scottish industry at an advantage over industry in England and Wales, but at the same time it would increase the burden on Scottish non-industrial ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While British Petroleum has provided its estimate of the effect of a change in the valuation of plant and machinery on local authority rate income, my right hon Friend has not yet received any such estimate from Scottish assessors. It would be wrong to anticipate the result of the inquiry which has been proceeding for some months now at official level and which will, I hope, shortly have an estimate of the financial effects of a change, which they can then consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, a good case has been made for con
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
tinuing the investigation of this matter, which was begun in 1979, and for pursuing the matter as vigorously as possible. We certainly do not want to continue indefinitely with a system that appears to penalise those who have established a particular kind of industry in Scotland and that might discourage such an industry from settling there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, however, that no case has been made for embarking precipitately on action without completing our consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and in particular without giving proper consideration to the interests of authorities such as Shetland, Central Region and Falkirk district which have high concentrations of plant-intensive industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would therefore be undesirable in our present state of knowledge to add this clause to the Bill. I hope that my hon Friend will feel able to withdraw it on my assurance that discussions with the convention and others concerned will be pursued as a matter of urgency in the coming months. 1 say to my hon Friend that if, at the end of the day, these consultations suggest that an important change of the kind that he proposes is desirable, there is likely to be a legislative opportunity next year when the recommendations of the Stodart Committee, if they lead to legislation, will be considered. That might be a useful vehicle for a change of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government at this stage do not wish to go beyond saying that we acknowledge that there is an anomaly that could have a significant effect for industry, but that it would not be right to go ahead at this stage with a matter of this importance without the proper consultations with COSLA and with the particular authorities most seriously affected, as the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire and others have pointed out. On that basis, I hope that my hon Friend will feel able not to press this new clause at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed the Minister's opening remarks. Perhaps if we had started earlier, I would not have been late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that part of this case rests in the differences between Scotland and England. The comparisons which were made between ICI Ardeer and ICI Wilton suggest that considerable problems are facing firms like ICI and BP. I was in the process of making the point when we adjourned that the problems of rating are such that even the big multinational companies cannot hide from it. One of the arguments which those who are enthusiastic for the abolition of rating forget is that taxes such as corporation tax can be avoided with consummate ease by multinationals, but that they cannot get away from ratings. Therefore, it is all the more irksome for firms such as BP and ICI, which can share their tax burden across the world, to be confronted by what has been called in other contexts "a little local difficulty". The difficulties in Central Scotland are of a considerable nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the finance department of Central Region has been concerned lest the law should be changed because of only one example. It takes the view that the precedent for changing law on the basis of one particular form of example is not a very strong case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be pointed out to the hon Gentleman that another example has been given this evening by one of his hon Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I was arguing not that about five firms in Scotland are in that position, but that it is this type of industry that requires a change in the law. To that extent, there is only one example. We are talking about external piping and the 200 cubic metres question which is one which we do not confront in any other issue of industrial rating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked to change the law on the basis of only one particular form of anomaly. The assessors and finance officers are reluctant to accept that this is a big enough breach or anomaly to require that change. But I take the point that in the areas concerned it is important for the firms and equally for the local authorities. The assessors and valuers are not, as we have said in earlier debates, of the local authority but they relate to it and therefore have a responsibility in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon Gentleman's clarification that he does not wish Scotland to be at a disadvantage and that when multinational companies are looking at costs they should not find advantages in having similar plant in England instead of in Scotland. If that is the case, we must understand it. Otherwise the impression given to me and others is that we must support the local authority, as that is the local authority view. The important view is that we should get the right balance in order to get and retain the jobs in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point in a minute. I take the point about the importance of attracting inward investment. I have held that view for some time but, unfortunately, in other circumstances it did not have the currency that it appears to have this evening. However, with regard to this matter, I am not saying that Scotland should be disadvantaged, but I want to make the point that if Scotland is to be disadvantaged in this area it could have repercussions in terms of other industrial and commercial ratepayers. Hon Members must take this point on board, because it is not only petrochemical firms that want to come to Scotland. If others wish to come to Central Region and are told that the rating system is to be changed in an arbitrary manner and that they will have to pay more rates, their chances of investing in our areas will be that much more diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make the point, in order to develop this argument, that the finance officers representing COSLA and other groupings are concerned about the impact on the rate poundage. They are also concerned about the ratable value, It would result in a reduction of ratable value, for example, in Falkirk district from £14 million to £7.5 million, which is a substantial reduction in the ratable value of a relatively small district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also to be considered is the effect on the calculation of the national standard amount of RSG distribution if this were to be carried through in a simplistic manner. There would also be the need for additional RSG compensation were the balance to be altered very quickly. I know that the assessors are still in the process of reporting, and that they are very conscious of the fact that the new clause would help only particular firms, with plants in the open air. It would have a detrimental
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
effect on other firms which would have to pay rates to compensate for that if no other adjustment were made by the Scottish Office. From what I can gather—I think that the Under-Secretary made this point—the Scottish Office wants to look at the impact on other ratepayers and has to take a far wider view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central region provided me with some information about the new clause. It said that subsection (2)(e) was unexceptionable, but that the definition of "item" in subsection 	<i>(2)(b)</i> was rather vague. The region is concerned that the word could be used to cover areas that were not originally intended and would like to see the provision sharpened. It also believes that the definition of "substantial" could cause difficulty, because it would contradict other parts of the Bill. It considers that the exclusion in subsection (2)(c) would be too broad, because to exclude from valuation machinery which includes moving parts of machinery could open a veritable can of worms and cause many difficulties for other ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very conscious in Central region that in some respects we are the industrial heartland of Scotland. Although the BP and ICI complexes form a substantial part of the rating system and the employment profile of the area, many other firms would then feel disgruntled, and we might hear on the next local government miscellaneous provisions legislation a great deal of special pleading. We are not legislating just for one group of hard-done-by companies. If we make the wrong decisions now we shall, as I think the Minister has pointed out, end up creating as many anomalies for the next group that we leave aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may give an example in respect of subsection 	<i>(2)(d).</i> The comprehensive exclusion of the system of pipes in designated types of premises would appear in some respects to exclude equipment in the petrochemical industry that was previously covered. It could even exclude such things as the central heating system in premises designated as part of the petrochemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to see ICI or BP forced to pay taxes. As one who spent a fair bit of last summer on the Committee considering the Finance Bill, I recognise that there are many multinational companies which do not meet their financial responsibilities. But if we are to get firms to meet these responsibilities, we should not be doing it through the mechanism of the rating system. I accept that such firms as BP, ICI and Air Products in Cumbernauld, in the constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), are at a relative disadvantage which can inhibit potential investment from other parts of the United Kingdom and provide our colleagues in England with an added attraction to justify their own areas. Nevertheless, we do not think that this is the appropriate mechanism by which these adjustments can be made, because we do not have much confidence in the Government's capacity at present to carry through the adjustments which would prevent the ratepayers of Central region and Falkirk district from having to carry an even heavier burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister has taken these points on board. We ask him to reconsider the position. I know that he has hinted broadly that there may be changes in the overall rating system in the next 12 months, if he is to provide an election bonus to the ratepayers by doing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
away with domestic rating, and there would certainly be a legislative opportunity to consider this anomaly. By that time the valuers and assessors will have come to a conclusion. We think that later rather than sooner would be the best time to deal with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the case, which is a sound one in equity in terms of the rights of one company against another within the United Kingdom, is not made out in terms of equity between ratepayers. In questions of rating, this area of industrial rating seems to have been forgotten about. Perhaps BP should have been wiser sooner, but in those days it was making much bigger profits than it is now. Perhaps these firms could have done something sooner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are talking not about history but about the years that lie ahead. If the Minister is prepared to concede that there is an anomaly here that should be dealt with, but that at the same time the local authorities should be given some assistance through rate support, and that an attempt should be made in the very near future to reconsider the matter, we should be happy to look sympathetically at whatever the Minister presents. But, until such time as he is prepared to give those assurances—to judge from his remarks this evening he seems extremely reluctant to do so—I hope that the Conservative Members who have tabled the new clause will think again and perhaps seek to withdraw it, and give us an opportunity to look at the issue at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a constructive debate on the new clause. My hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) emphasised two aspects—first, keeping in Scotland the jobs that are there and, secondly, attracting jobs to Scotland and ensuring that Scotland is not a disadvantaged location for very important jobs in a modern and important industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the general support given by the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) and for the case that he made on behalf of Air Products. It is important to note—I come now to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill)—that we are not talking just about BP at Grangemouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire made a constructive response to the proposal, although it became less constructive in the last half-minute or so. I accept his point that there would be implications for other industrial and commercial ratepayers if changes were made in any direction. As to whether we should deal only with this anomaly or leave it for a general reform of the rating system, I argue that this anomaly has resulted from changes to the law which were made in the rest of 'the United Kingdom but not in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman made a number of detailed criticisms of new clause 1 on behalf of Central region. He will be delighted to know that I agree with the suggestion that it should be withdrawn. Therefore, as there will perhaps be further consulta
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
tions, there is no need for me to detain the Committee by replying in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon Friend the Minister for his assurances that he recognises that there is an anomaly and that the inquiry will continue—speedily but not precipitately I think was his definition. I accept that. It is a matter of urgency that we should reach a conclusion. The Stodart committee legislation next year would provide an opportunity for a change in the law, if that is generally agreed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is the result of an initiative taken by community councils in East Lothian. They made representations to the district council, which in turn made representations to me. This is an example of how community councils can provide constructive ideas which can be debated at these exalted heights, even at this time of night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport is a special problem in rural areas, especially for remote communities in Scotland and for the elderly people in them. I should perhaps stress that Lothian regional council provides an excellent concessionary travel scheme for pensioners, which applies to buses and trains. We are not sure whether the new scheme, which gives a free pass rather than tokens, will apply to British Rail's trains. I understand that that is under negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, a significant number of old people live in areas that can never be efficiently served by buses or trains. It is not feasible to run transport services up to every farm road end in the Lammermoors, the Highlands or other remote rural communities. Most pensioners in these areas cannot afford to run cars, so to all intents and purposes they might as well be stranded. They may have concessionary travel tokens from local authorities, but they cannot use them, because they cannot get to buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister wants to prevent local authorities from improving services, because each time they talk of doing it they are accused of being profligate, so he may not sympathise with my sug
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
gestions about adding to services at this stage. However, there is clear justification in terms of need, if nothing else, for extending the scope of concessionary travel for pensioners so that taxis can be brought into the scheme for elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister need not worry, because I am not asking for additional money at this stage. All that I ask through the new clause is for the power for local authorities to extend their concessionary fare schemes to cover taxis. At present it is not legally possible for them to do so. Section 138 of the Transport Act 1968 restricts concessionary travel schemes to travel on buses and trains. I am not even sure that there is specific reference to trains, although it has worked in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 2 is to give local authorities the discretion—no more than that—to make special arrangements for remote rural areas within their boundaries, for instance. It has the support of community councils, certainly in East Lothian and no doubt in other parts of Scotland. It has the support of the East Lothian district council and of the taxi operators there—perhaps not surprisingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would not in itself involve additional public expenditure now. It would simply remove an unnecessary statutory provision, as I see it, which prevents local authorities from providing concessionary travel facilities under the circumstances that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that one of the stated purposes of the Bill is to remove unnecessary restrictions from local authorities, so I am extending an opportunity to him now to remove another unnecessary restriction. I commend new clause 2 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman said twice that the new clause would not lead to any extra financial obligations on local authorities. He is correct, but on one assumption only which is that no local authority would seek to use the powers provided. If a local authority did decide to use them, 'they would inevitably lead to an increase in expenditure, because surely it is not seriously being suggested that a local authority would reduce its expenditure on buses and trains in order to finance taxis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must accept that the hon Gentleman's proposal would have a significant effect on public expenditure if it were to toe used as widely as he advocates. Taxis are not exactly the cheapest form of public transport. We are considering journeys from distant parts of rural areas, and I am not surprised that taxi operators are in favour of a provision of this sort, because I suspect that the fares which they would collect from the local authority—and therefore from the ratepayer or taxpayer—would be substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not question the hon Gentleman's assertion that existing forms of public transport often do not reach some of those most in need of them. But some of the schemes that have been promoted in recent years to try to deal with that problem have been extremely imaginative and have helped to make significant progress. The Border courier service is an obvious example which will be familiar to the hon
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
Gentleman. Then there is the development of the post buses. I travelled on one of those in the borders some months ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a wonder the hon Gentleman was not lynched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I was most impressed by the way in which a postal service, which clearly has to go to all parts of the rural areas, is able at the same time to provide a service that meets transport needs—particularly of the elderly and disabled—in small villages. That seems to me a sensible way of proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would also be enormous practical problems. If we are simply considering a local authority reimbursing a bus operator or the operator of a public transport service, that is a fairly straightforward matter. But, the relationship 'between a local authority and all the taxi operators in the locality would be a significant factor to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend aware that there are a number of taxi firms, including some in Edinburgh, that operate concessionary fares off their own bat? Would he consider it worth examining that to see whether similar arrangements could be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, if some taxi owners wish to provide that sort of service and feel that it is in their interest as well as that of the community to do so, we would wish to encourage it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may indeed be current practice that for a journey for a specific purpose a service of that sort should be provided. Clearly, the expenditure implications are reasonably modest. But the new clause proposes a wide-ranging facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Facility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That facility would provide for general travel by anyone who happens to be either elderly or disabled, or who comes within the category for any other reason. The expenditure implications of that—one must assume that the hon Gentleman hopes that his new clause would be implemented and used by local authorities throughout Scotland—would be substantial. Clearly, if people are entitled to free travel by taxi they will use that facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that my hon Friend does not expect that such travel will necessarily be free although I suppose that in extreme instances it might

	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
be. But the provision allows a reduction—that is, a concessionary fare or a rebate on an agreed fare structure. It would be rather a brave suggestion that taxi fares should be met totally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister is being over-zealous in his argument to suggest that there will be an inevitable additional expenditure, because nobody would want to reduce present expenditure on concessionary fare systems. As he has been the first to say, what local government does within the totality of its budget is for itself to decide, provided it keeps within that. There might well be a switch of resources from something else. That would be a difficult priority to judge, but perhaps it should be left to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. If the hon Gentleman can give me an absolute assurance that should the power be implemented the local authorities would not come to the Government some weeks later asking for an increased allocation in grant to cover their costs in respect of that, I might be more attracted to the proposal. But I would be surprised if, although the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian said that he was not seeking additional resources to cover the costs of such a facility, that did not become a permanent feature of any such measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the question of whether the fares would be concessionary or free, I accept the point made by the hon Gentleman. But at present some local authorities wish to introduced free travel for such groups, and no doubt would provide free taxi rides for all elderly people. One authority that I am thinking of is not far distant from the hon Gentlemen's constituency. The point that I am making is not entirely hypothetical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I am unable to commend the new clause to the Committee. I appreciate the reasons Why the hon Gentleman wishes such a facility to be introduced, but I honestly believe that the extension of the Border courier or post bus services will more adequately meet the transport needs of the groups to which he referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been less than helpful in his reply on this occasion. He has demonstrated that there is a need for a flexible — and in many instances non-conventional—approach to public transport in rural areas. He cited the Border courier service, which is an extremely interesting experiment in public transport for remote areas, and post buses, which also operate in parts of my constituency and certainly perform a useful function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I have said, it is absolutely out of the question that public transport systems—whether they are minibuses, large buses, trains or anything else— will go to every remote community. So under the present restrictive legislation it is simply not possible for many pensioners in remote communities—of whom there are many in my constituency and in the constituencies of Conservative hon Gentlemen—to take advantage of the concessionary travel schemes that should be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
A number of people have written to me saying that their travel tokens—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Division in the House was called, I was emphasising the need for a flexible approach to public transport in remote rural areas. I wish to make two brief points before concluding my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if local authorities wish to provide public transport for remote communities nowadays, they often have no option but to send a big bus, which must be extremely costly. Such services as there are in some small communities—I can cite examples, such as Oldhamstocks in East Lothian—can be so restricted as to consist of only one bus a week. People are taken by bus from Oldhamstocks to Dunbar to do their shopping, but they cannot get a bus back because the next one does not leave until the following week. That is a fairly useless state of affairs. Those people have to take taxis back, and do not get any assistance with the fare. Savings could actually be generated by running a hire car or taxi rather than a bus to such places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I stress again that I do not seek to impose an obligation on local authorities to provide such services. I simply emphasise that there is a clear need in certain restricted specific areas for such a flexible approach, whereas in section 138 of the Transport Act there is a specific statutory provision preventing local authorities adopting a flexible approach that would take into account hire cars and taxis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot answer for my hon Friends, but I feel that the Minister is being unduly inflexible. He is unnecessarily determined to maintain the restriction on local authorities, and I certainly intend to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon Gentleman comes to a firm conclusion, I ask him to reconsider the matter. His new clause is an open-ended invitation to local authorities to allow free transport by taxi whenever an elderly or disabled person wishes to travel. If the hon Gentleman wishes his new clause to be used, he must appreciate that he cannot possibly justify saying that it does not necessarily have any financial implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument could have been used against ever providing even a train service. It is not rational.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, if anyone wished to provide a rail service but said that it would have no public expenditure implications, we should be entitled to doubt the validity of the observation. I do not comment on the merits of the hon Gentleman's suggestion. I merely tell him that it is utter nonsense to say that the Committee should be happy to accept the new clause because no financial im-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
plications will necessarily arise from it. The hon Gentleman must be aware that that is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also point out that we are concerned with improving public transport, which can be provided by means other than normal scheduled bus services. The post bus system reaches out into all the remoter parts of communities. It there are gaps in local authorities' existing provision, there is no reason why the post bus should not be used. It is irresponsible to suggest that a person who has gone shopping should be able to use a taxi to go 10, 15 or 20 miles at the ratepayers' expense. I ask the hon Gentleman to consider carefully before committing himself to it in the way that he has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will force the new clause to a Division, so perhaps I should comment briefly. I had not intended to speak, but it is only fair to my hon Friend to do so. We should be grateful to him for drawing attention to a genuine problem in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister's comments were somewhat unfair. I believe that we must trust local authorities to some extent. Someone who listened to the Minister's speech in a superficial way might form the impression that the new clause will open the floodgates and that a mass of irresponsible local authorities will spatter the geography of their electoral areas with free taxi services for the elderly. That is not what is in my hon Friend's mind. Perhaps this machinery could lead to such a situation, but only given a rash irresponsibility on the part of local authorities which—despite the dire suspicions that are sometimes harboured on the other side of the Committee about local government—it is unreasonable to assume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, my hon Friend wants to free local authorities to take decisions about 'the best way of spending what they can afford on transport. He says that there may be special circumstances—he gave an instance from his constituency—in which it may be a good buy to put on a taxi for the very small number of people who may be travelling father than to run a whopping great public service vehicle at a substantial loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some situations—we do not suggest that they would be commonplace—a taxi might be cheaper than a bus rumbling down small country roads for a houle of people and cunning up substantial deficits in the process. It is suggested that that option should be open to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that any power given to a local authority can have public spending implications. But if a local authority wants to avail itself, in a limited number of cases, of a right to run a subsidised service such as my hon Friend has outlined, it will have to find the money at the expense of some other service, unless the Government generously increase its overall allocation. Neither the Under-Secretary nor any other Scottish Office Minister is likely to be guilty of such weakness or—to use the jargon phrase of the Committee—irresponsibility. The Ministers are not likely to hand over money on
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
the basis of a permissive power when they consider it wrong to do so. The local authority would therefore have to decide what priority this possibility should have. If it wanted to set up this service at the expense of some other service, that would be a legitimate choice for it to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's condemnation was somewhat sweeping. It would have been better if he had given a more sympathetic response at least to the possibilities and the arguments that lie behind this initiative. If he had done so, I suspect that my hon Friend might not have wanted to divide the Committee on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this had been my amendment, I would not have pushed it to a Division, but I recognise that my hon Friend feels very strongly about the matter. We have now either to express our support for the principle of helping rural transport—our action may be misunderstood and no doubt will be unfairly described by the Under-Secretary of State as irresponsibility—or face the misinterpretation of lack of sympathy, and being lumped in with the Tories, if we are forced either not to vote or to vote against the new clause. I shall bravely face that cruel decision. As I believe in the heart and believe it is important to identify the Labour Party with the cause of right—right with a small " r "—I think that my hon Friends and I should express our support for the need for a more sympathetic and energetic approach to the problems of rural transport. I speak only for myself. I am in no position to instruct or ask my hon Friends, but I shall support my hon Friend if he feels that it is necessary to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>VALUATION APPEALS BY DOMESTIC RATEPAYERS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled new clause 3 as a result of what I believed was fairly widespread frustration created by the way in which appeals were dealt with following the revaluation of rates in 1978. Those who appealed against their new valuations were issued with an explanatory booklet that set out the procedure, which seemed very simple. Advice was given that preparation of a case could qualify for legal aid, but that presentation of the case could not. There was nothing to warn ratepayers who, after all, are ordinary citizens, about what they were expected to face. A number of people with whom I discussed the matter expected that there would be a relatively informal hearing at which they could put forward their cases and have them considered sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They found that the reality was very different. Proceedings were conducted on the lines of a court case. Everyone was sworn in. Assessors and their staff were prepared with expert witnesses and questions with which to cross-examine the unfortunate appellants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those to whom I spoke say that the atmosphere came as something of a shock that inhibited many of them from making the best of their cases. There was widespread feeling that the proceedings were somewhat one-sided, with all the experts on one side and the unprepared ratepayers on the other. They felt that there was an imbalance in expertise and knowledge of procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 3 refers particularly to domestic ratepayers, but I believe that the problem could go wider —small businesses and shops face the same situation. A large firm may be able to afford the cost of properly fighting its way through the legal procedure, but most firms would find that ruinously expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I feel that there is a need for this or some similar amendment to ensure that, in any future revaluation, appeals against the new valuations are not dealt with in a way which leaves a feeling of unfairness among the appellants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying to my hon Friend the Minister that I do not necessarily wish to press the new clause. Secondly, the matter is not desperately urgent, as we do not know when the next revaluation will take place. However, I hope that he will be able to give an assurance to the Committee—if he cannot accept the new clause—that the matter will be discussed so that, if there is another revaluation, the feeling of unfairness which I believe was fairly widespread does not recur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has correctly pointed to the sense of frustration that was felt by many thousands of appellants about the valuation appeals procedures following the effects of the 1978 revaluation and the way in which those appeals were heard and ^considered by the valuation appeals committees. Clearly, a number of the facts to which he referred are in common with the problems that often arise at public inquiries. The ordinary person—the domestic ratepayer in this case—who is without significant means of his own feels that the matter is loaded against his interests in a way with which it is difficult for him to compete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
12 midnight
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, the matter is perhaps misunderstood by many domestic ratepayers, because facilities are available which are sometimes not taken up. For example, the new clause refers to a model scheme which would ensure that the domestic ratepayer receives
	<br><blockquote><p>"adequate advice on the preparation of their appeals".</p></blockquote>
To some extent, that advice is already available under the legal advice and assistance scheme, which enables those ratepayers with modest means to consider whether they might be entitled to advice and assistance. Although it would not involve representation at the actual hearing, it might nevertheless be useful to them in the preparation of their cases or in establishing their rights at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon Friend is aware that if a ratepayer writes making inquiry of the assessor after receiving a valuation, in the Lothian region, certainly, he receives a form telling him that the inquiry will be treated as an appeal. After a period of time, he is sent a notice reminding him that his appeal is coming up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is considering this question, he might look at the extraordinary anomaly whereby a simple explanation to the ratepayer might avoid a number of appeals in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has raised a viable point. The number of appeals, which always seems frighteningly large, might be substantially reduced if a simple explanation of that type were adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friends new clause would also appear to require the local authority to ensure that there was representation for the appellant. That would have substantial expenditure implications, and I am sure that my hon Friend would not wish to pursue that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, on the whole matter, I can give my hon Friend the assurance that he sought in his concluding remarks, because my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has asked the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council to review the whole question of the 1978 (revaluation to see what lessons can be drawn from the experience of that revaluation, and, in particular, to look into .many of the objections, complaints and concerns expressed by members of .the public as a consequence of the revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope, therefore, that the council will be able, after considering the matter, to come up with a number of useful recommendations, to which we shall be only too anxious to give urgent consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. My hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) raised an important point on which he has received an assurance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to contribute to this debate, but perhaps the hon Member for Ren

frewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) could take up the point made by the Minister when he said that he was sure that he, the hon Gentleman, would not wish to pursue the possibility of legal aid in these proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that a safe assumption, or is legal aid implicit in the new clause? Does the Minister think, at least in theory—it might be difficult in the present financial climate—that the legal aid scheme should be extended beyond the LAA 3 formula to representation directly at appeals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I think that it is at least implicit in the new clause that the legal aid scheme would be so extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In introducing the new clause, I said that I would not necessarily push it to a Division. The Minister replied, and recognised the problem. I accept that the matter is being discussed by the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council together with other evidence about what happens to appeals and complaints about appeal procedures, and on that basis I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 31 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 disqualifies, among others, local government employees from serving as councillors on the local authorities which employ them. The object of the new clause is to amend section 31 to permit local government employees, other than chief officers or deputy chief officers, to serve as councillors of their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many thousands of local government workers in this country who are unable to seek election to their employing local authority. All local authority employees can 'be councillors. If they are employed by the region they can serve as a councillor in the district or, if .they work for the district, they can serve as councillor in the regional authority; but none may serve on his employing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
The principle which motivates me to raise the matter through a new clause is that this is a severe and unreasonable restriction of a civil right. For that important reason alone I would have tabled the new clause. But it is also the case that we lose the services of many talented people for our local authorities and there is a loss of expertise which would enhance local authorities and improve the quality of our local government. We leave out from service on local authorities many .people. We lose the services of teachers, large numbers of manual workers, transport workers and local authority staff. That adds up to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in times when it is important to extend democracy and democratic control. I would not like it suggested that what I am proposing tonight in any way denies democracy or reduces or dilutes democratic control by involving the local authority employees themselves in the affairs of their employing authority. I shall say why in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is offensive to many people who work in local government and who are local authority employees that they are treated as second-class citizens and that somehow their rights are greatly diminished by the present law. Parliament has a duty to defend the freedom of individuals and to defend their rights to seek election to authorities. That is why I am seeking this extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy behind the new clause has been widely supported throughout Scotland and throughout the country. It is the policy of the Labour Party and of the trade union movement. I believe that even if the new clause is not accepted tonight, we are not far from the time when it will be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would not include designated chief officials or deputy chief officials. They are specifically excluded because they advise the authorities. I do not believe that .the Committee would accept that those who advise authorities in matters of policy can at the same time be local authority councillors. I believe that the chief officials would accept that and recognise that as a proper position to take up. In order that they may be easily identified, it should be noted that the new clause makes specific reference to who they are. There can be no question of any difficulty in identifying them if the new clause becames part of the Bill and, subsequently, part of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, as I say, that the new clause would be very popular in the country. I have not had a single objection put to me to the proposal, although I have made sure that it is widely known that I place the matter before the Committee tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new clause is watertight. I hope that the Minister will not say that my proposal is bad law. I do not believe that it is. It is sound in every respect and beneficial to our political and public life. For those reasons I hope that the Government will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether at this late hour I can have a few moments tolerance from colleagues on this Committee. Labour Members welcome the new clause—also in the name of myself and other of my hon Friends—which was moved with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
a great deal of concise good sense by my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a cause we have long fought and it is a good opportunity for the Minister to show a little graceful flexibility and accept the new clause. I can assure him that we would hurry to give him due credit for so doing, and I say that in an optimistic spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the broader the base of democratic involvement the better. I accept that there is a point at which there is a potential clash of interests for an employee of an authority who is also an elected member of that authority. But my hon Friend is right in saying that that point arises where there is direct contact between the elected members and an official who is involved in the policymaking process. If those two are confused there are very real and genuine difficulties. The new clause as drafted deals adequately with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that it could be argued that there will be grey areas and that there may be difficulties on the margin. But the advantage of being able to harness the talent, industry and enthusiasm of a large number of people who at the moment are arbitrarily disqualified could well outweigh any difficulties that might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our political system as a whole—I shall not elaborate at length—there are many examples of people who might be thought to have an interest but who are, very properly, allowed either to vote or to participate, but where the possibility of a clash would appear as great as in the area we are now discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that a large number of Labour councillors, but by no means exclusively Labour councillors, live in council houses. But that does not disqualify them, although they are tenants of the authority for which they are elected members, from taking full part in group discussions or council discussions on housing policy. There would be very little point in being on a district council if they could not take part in such discussions. In a sense those people have a direct interest in the decisions they are taking. Indeed, all elected members are ratepayers within the local authority on which they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a councillor I would have to admit that I had a distinct interest both in the level of services being provided and the impact of rates upon my own purse. One or two of my colleagues were talking to me earlier today about the impact of rates decisions upon their family budgets and why they thought that, on the whole, they would have to grin cheerfully and bear it in the interests of adequate and humane services. [Honourable Members: "Oh."] It may very well be that, as the caterwauling rises from Government Members, this level of objective ability to stand away from a problem is beyond their comprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone on a local authority has to do that, because everyone is a ratepayer. I am not sure that that level of apparent interest is any greater than that, for example, in the case of a teacher employed by a region who would clearly not wish to be involved in direct discussions about his school, or about
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
staffing of schools which might involve colleagues he knew. He would have to keep out of that. But Why should he not be able to contribute, for example, to the general discussion of education policy in the same way as anyone who is a parent with pupils in the school with a similar direct interest?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could go on arguing this point, but we all have that sort of interest in our local authority and ought to have it. That should not disqualify anyone from taking the ultimate interest of offering himself for election or offering him enthusiasm or knowledge in the cause of that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that the balance of justice is on the side of generosity and that we ought to enfranchise, in this ultimate way, those employed at the levels envisaged in the new clause. I have no hesitation in wishing it well and saying that, if my hon Friend pushes it to a Division, there will be no ifs or buts, and I shall support it wholeheartedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) begin his remarks by saying that this was a cause for which he and his party had long fought. I was waiting to hear why, having long fought for it, they had done nothing about it during the six years of the previous Labour Government, but we were given no answer to that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is one of those delightful areas of policy in which Labour Party policy and Labour Government policy tend to be different animals and, therefore, one does not necessarily lead to the other. However, that may be a matter for private grief rather than public discussion, into which my hon Friends and I ought not to intrude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman does not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. I certainly do not understand it, and I never claimed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the proposal's merits, the hon Gentleman who tabled the amendment made no reference to the fact that the matter has been extensively considered twice in recent years and on each occasion the recommendation of those considering the matter has come down firmly against the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Commission considered the matter and paragraph 937 of its report came down firmly against changing existing arrangements. The Prime Minister's committee on local government rules of conduct reported to the last Labour Government in the summer of 1974—and that may explain why they did nothing about it. Its conclusion was that the existing rules of conduct are appropriate and should not be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the evidence taken by the Redcliffe-Maud committee there was evidence from the Scottish local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
authorities who supported its conclusions. We have heard nothing to suggest that anyone has changed his mind since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Royal Commission and a special committee set up to consider local government rules of conduct, both concluded, with the support of the Scottish local authorities, that no change in the existing rules would be appropriate. Opposition Members have demonstrated no reason for going against that advice. The Redcliffe-Maud committee spoke to three different areas when recommending against the change. First, it argued that it is necessary to avoid any conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict 'between the individual public duty as an elected member and his personal interest as an employee. Secondly, it is important to preserve the political impartiality of officers of local authorities at all levels and one should avoid any suggestion that could encourage employees to declare their political views if they were employed by the local authority concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it is necessary to maintain sensible working relationships at all levels of an authority's organisation and to avoid divided loyalties. Clearly, it would be inappropriate if, for example, the director of parks in a local authority found that one of his junior subordinates was chairman of the leisure and recreation committee. That would create a difficult relationship between the employer and employee which would not he satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) was wrong to suggest that local authority officials are second-class citizens because they cannot stand for office in the local authority of which they are employees. That would be like suggesting that civil servants are second-class citizens because they cannot stand for Parliament. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps hon Members believe that, but I am sure that civil servants do not believe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister repeat that? The cheering for the civil servants drowned what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that the hon Gentleman's suggestion that local authority employees are second-class citizens because they cannot stand for a local authority, is no more justified than it would be to say that civil servants are second-class citizens because they cannot stand for Parliament. Similar considerations may apply to local authority employees which would lead them to a similar conclusion. I have no evidence that large numbers of civil servants or local government employees would be anxious to become elected Members as they have probably seen too much of what being an elected Member means to seek to emulate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that I came across a member of the House of Commons staff the other day who is paid less than a Member of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an unusual phenomenon
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
and it is right of the hon Gentleman to draw the public's attention to such a unique experience as he has enjoyed. Clearly, as the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) suggested, such a person must come below the poverty line if he falls into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I simply say to the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East that he has not raised a new issue. It was extensively considered in recent years and the recommendations of the bodies specifically appointed to look into these matters came down unanimously against it, with the support, at the time, of the Scottish local authorities. On that basis, I obviously could not commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unable to accept that. First of all, the Redcliffe-Maud committee did not deal specifically with the Scottish local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it did not do that. There was a similar Committee meeting at the same time dealing with Scotland. That was the Wheatley Commission, to which the Minister referred earlier. Notwithstanding that, even if they reached those conclusions, it does not stand for ever and a day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon Gentleman is confused. Lord Redcliffe-Maud chaired two committees. One was the Royal Commission on English local government reform, and the hon Gentleman is right that that had nothing to do with Scotland, but the committee to which I referred was the Prime Minister's committee on rules of conduct in local government. On that matter evidence was taken from the Scottish local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I thought that the Minister was referring to the Redcliffe-Maud committee dealing with the structure of local government in England and Wales. None the less, even though the committees sat and took evidence in the 1970s and reached a conclusion that it was not appropriate at that time to introduce the provisions which I am proposing here this evening, I think that we have moved on and that public opinion is now ready to accept this proposition and it is widely supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities undoubtedly expressed their view at that time. I do not argue with the Minister that that was exactly what they said. The view of local authority staffs and manual workers on the same issue was not reported. Their view was and remains that they have diminished civil rights as a consequence of the law as it stands. I must therefore urge my hon Friends to divide the Committee on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
