<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention in this group of amendments to try to firm up the Government's resolve. If we were to exclude consideration of the financial implications of the Bill there would not be much disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on their approach to these matters. But the fact is that the Government have not seen fit to provide financial backing for the Bill to any extent. Therefore, we seek to extend the scope of provision for special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 seeks to impose a power, rather than a duty, on an education authority to provide for children in its area. We feel that it is necessary at this time to impose obligations on local authorities. We think that with the best will in the world, local authorities, although their financial grants are reduced, should have these obligations imposed upon them, and consequently they must try to find the money or they must pressurise the Government to make money available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the provision of adequate educational facilities for those youngsters with special educational needs must be given as quickly as possible. I am sure that we shall return to the fact that this is the International Year of Disabled People. We feel that the Government cannot simply hide behind this legislation and say that this is all they will do. We believe that it is the Government's responsibility to put their money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 seeks to place an obligation on the local authority to provide for special educational needs. Simply to say that there should be a power is not sufficient. Over the years local authorities have done what they have seen fit to do to deal with these matters, but their performance has not been good enough. Following on the recommendations of the Warnock report, we hope that in the first instance there will be an obligation on local authorities to provide for special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We make this point in respect of those children who have not yet attained school age, because the provision of nursery education in Scotland is uneven, especially in the regions resulting from the aggregation of old local authorities, which in the past had differing priorities. Consequently the level of provision across a region such as Strathclyde is not consistent. Therefore, amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
No. 76 seeks to ensure that the obligation on local authorities to provide for the special education of young people below school age should be irrespective of nursery provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may seen contradictory in the light of the calls that have been made for integration at every level of education, wherever possible, but an exception has to be made for children with special educational needs, a group which is poorly enough served by normal nursery or pre-school playgroup provision. The legislation should reflect the commitment of giving high priority to the special educational needs of the under-fives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children under 5 are in some respects probably the most sensitive group. Their parents are having to come to terms with the children's disabilities and they need as much relief as possible and assistance so that they can adjust to the children's special needs—not only educational needs. Nursery provision is a tremendous help in this respect. But when these children get older and their natural school life has ended at the age of 16, a variety of problems can confront them. It is desirable that during this crucial time between the ages of 16 and 19 they are retained, where necessary, within the school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that in some parts of the country there are intermediate centres. Unfortunately, there are far too few of them, and in certain circumstances they are having to be closed because of expenditure cuts. Nevertheless, there ought to be an option for young people between 16 and 19 to be included within the school system without any prejudice to their subsequently being provided for elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking to this legislation for a comprehensive system of care for those with special educational needs, and we do not envisage those needs stopping at the age of 16. Some groups could benefit from continued education within the school system. Others might do better at an intermediate centre, if that were possible. If it were not possible, and if there were places within the school system, we would prefer these children to remain within the school system until places could be found for them elsewhere. We think that the extesion of age from 16 to 19 would be preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment opportunities for this age group are probably more limited than for any comparable group of young people aged 16 to 19, and with present high unemployment it would be desirable to keep them within an environment where they would feel settled and at home, and where their emotional development could be sustained in a way which would not cause undue anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there would be problems for the 16- to 19-year-olds in terms of the sheer age, weight and, size of many of the youngsters, but we feel that there should be an adequate back-up system to meet the challenge of this extension of educational provision. At this stage, we should not talk only about youngsters with severe special educational needs. We would also want to make sure that implicit in the Government's approach in an attempt to ensure that these young people can live as full a life within the educational system as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some weeks ago I visited Lawrence Hill academy in Alloa, a high school in my constituency. It was built in the late 1960s as a purpose-built comprehensive with
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
community facilities and a special education unit. It serves the area of the county of Clackmannan, extending into parts of Sterlingshire around Dunblane and Bridge of Allan. The children with educational difficulties are mostly educationally subnormal. I do not think that there are any with physical difficulties. They are included within the normal timetable of the school so far as that is practicable. They participate in un-streamed tutor groups. Although they spend a fair amount of time in the educational unit receiving remedial education and the basic educational skills, they are a part of the life of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night on the local government Bill we had a long and interesting debate on access and disability. I touched on this matter this morning, and I am the first to recognise that, even though Lawrence Hill academy has excellent facilities for young people with certain special educational needs, the physically handicapped cannot be accommodated in the building. We hope that as a result of the initiative which the Secretary of State took last night, in response to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) and others, an attempt will be made soon by local authorities to begin adapting their existing facilities to ensure that the maximum degree of access and egress is available to the physically handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the Government have set their face against making the financial provision which would enable this to become a reality overnight. Nevertheless, we feel that, within this legisalation, obligations ought to be imposed on local authorities and the Government ought to recognise the desirability of this approach. We ought, to be working towards the maximum degree feasible of integration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that some of our school buildings— particularly in the older schools in the urban areas— do not lend themselves to the integration envisaged by the Bill. Nevertheless, we wish to ensure a fairly comprehensive programme of examination of the existing educational facilities to see what aids can be provided and whether it will be possible for the young people to be accommodated on the ground floors of schools, whether ramps can be built or facilities provided for youngsters to alight from and board the buses required to bring them to school. We should like priority to be given to the question of integration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am endeavouring to avoid the worst excesses of party prejudice, as I appreciate that there is no small amount of good will on the Government's part. However, good will without financial backing is not sufficient. We hope that even if the Minister is not prepared to put his money where his mouth is on the subject of integration, he will give us an undertaking, following consideration of this part of the Bill, that there will be a detailed examination of Scotland's needs, set against the recommendations of the Warnock report and the requirements of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that integration is essential if the disabled and those with special educational needs are to realise their full potential, not in the narrow academic sense, but as social animals able to participate in the life of the community. More importantly, they must be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
accepted by the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the biggest problems facing those with special educational needs is the fact that in the eyes of many people they are not part of the community, but are separate. I do not really want to use the word, but there is a kind of apartheid; they are put in a separate compartment, which invariably means that such young people grow up lonely and without full exposure to all that life can offer. Opposition Members feel that the opportunities available in other countries should be afforded to the young people in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 75 were accepted, it would go some way to achieving what has already been accepted elsewhere in the. world. The text of the amendment is based on the thrust of legislation passed in the United States of America in 1975. We believe that the provision for the handicapped in other parts of the world is, by and large, much better than that in the United Kingdom. We feel that this legislation provides the opportunity to look afresh at our commitment to those with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The American legislation that I mentioned was the Education of All Handicapped Children Act 1975, whose basic principle was that the handicapped and non-handicapped would be educated together as much as possible. It also said that the handicapped would be placed in separate classes
	<br><blockquote><p>"only when the nature or severity of their handicap is such that education in regular classes, even if they are provided with supplementary aids and services, cannot be achieved satisfactorily."</p></blockquote>
The resulting commitment achieved a gradual change in the United States which took account of the special needs of this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that local authorities will have a duty to see that the children who were assessed as being in need of special education would be educated whenever possible in ordinary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman, but I do not think that his present argument is relevant to the amendments under discussion. We are discussing the functions of the education authority rather than the general aspect of the provision of special educational needs. The clause sets out the powers and so on which can be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to fall foul of you, Mr. Gourlay, so early in the afternoon. I merely referred to amendment No. 75 and cited a description of the American legislation on which it is based. I am trying to point out that if the local authority has functions in respect of children and young persons with certain educational needs, those functions will depend on the facilities provided. I tried to show that there were precedents in other parts of the world. I do not wish to take up the Committee's time, but it is significant that our attention was drawn to that legislation in a handout kindly provided for us by the Advisory Centre for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways the American experience is different from ours, but it is clear that the Americans have assumed a responsibility for the education of the handicapped in a way that we have not. While I accept the good intentions of the supporters of this legislation, there are parts of it that could be firmed up. I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
taken the American legislation as an example and I hope that if amendment No. 75 is agreed the education authorities will have a duty to make provision for special educational needs in ordinary schools unless the nature and severity of the handicapped make that impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that it is not possible to afford a carte blanche provision, because we cannot say that everyone will be integrated. That may be because of the nature of the handicap or because of the distraction that would be caused to others. I return to point that I made about the parents' charter—that we must see the needs of the community in totality. It is not enough to look after one minority if, in some respects, the provision for that minority undermines that for the rest of the community. I know that the Minister would not use such an argument to undermine what I am trying to suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not suggest that integration should be complete because the nature of the handicap could distress other children and could therefore undermine the provision of education generally, which is the responsibility of the local authorities. I have yet to see the film "The Elephant Man", but I have seen clips of it on television. Although the film is set in Victorian times, and although the nature of the deformity is hideous, there are still people in this country who suffer from that disease. If they were allowed to enter schools they could cause a great deal of anxiety. I say that in the recognition that one of my colleagues has some knowledge of a case of someone suffering from this illness. It is very difficult to help people who suffer from disabilities of that type, and we feel that someone with such a complaint might well create many difficulties in the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not endeavouring to list categories of people who would not be acceptable in schools; I am merely pointing out that problems can arise. We would not wish to give the impression that every child with a handicap could be allowed into the system. I am not endeavouring to put up barriers, but we must be responsible about this matter. There are children who are disturbed or who have problems that could well undermine the education of the others in the class. We hope that the thrust of amendment No. 75 will be acceptable to the Minister, and that if the form of words is not wholly to his liking he will be able to suggest an alternative wording which we can return to on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has tabled some amendments which are in some respects very similar to ours. I am sure that he will wish to discuss his amendments. At this stage we have not decided which amendments we will wish to press to a vote. We will wish to hear, first, what the Government have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an area on which we hope for constructive discussion not obstructed by hard party differences. Notwithstanding the question of financial provision, there is a fair degree of unanimity about this matter. I hope that the tyranny of the Government Whip will be lifted, and that Conservative hon. Members will be able to participate in the debate. I am confident that my hon. Friends will be here and will participate fully, as the record shows that they have done over the weeks, but it is unfortunate that two humanitarian issues should fall for consideration on the same day—the question of overseas aid, which is being considered in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
the Chamber, and the question of the provision for those with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government will be able to reconsider their position in respect of local authorities, and that they will impose an obligation on local authorities to provide educational facilities for the under-fives. The provision of nursery education in Scotland is uneven. In some areas, far from improving, it will deteriorate, because of the financial constraints being imposed on local authorities. Nevertheless, we feel that priority should be given to the under-fives, where in many respects one is endeavouring to assist the parents as much as the individual youngsters, because the parents are probably at the time of greatest stress. They often have other young children, and the relief given by nursery provision and the assistance from professionals would be of great help to the family as a whole—to the other young children and to the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also make the point that those who are outside the school age at the other end of the spectrum—the post-16 age group—should be afforded an opportunity where appropriate to stay on at school, where their educational development may be assisted or when there is nowhere else for them to go. One of the most worrying aspects of the present cuts in public expenditure is that no intermediate provision is being made for youngsters between 16 and 19 years. One can argue the same case for the non-handicapped as for the handicapped, but we feel that the needs of the latter group should be a priority and that they should be helped to get through a period often of severe emotional adjustment. In the absence of intermediate facilities, it would not be unreasonable for the school leaving age to be extended for that group of 16- to 19-year-olds, so that they can be included in the ambit of the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that there will be integration in schools wherever possible for all young people, and that this integration will be consistent with the degree of handicap and with the aids and services which the local authorities will provide. We are not being unreasonable on this subject. We are asking local authorities, with the assistance and the positive backing of the Scottish Education Department, to look at the needs of their area and to seek to adjust their buildings. We hope that from the provisions of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, which was discussed last night, fresh impetus will be given and that local authorities will meet their responsibilities. If these facilities of aids and services can be achieved and if at the same time it can be clearly understood that the education of the other children will not be detrimentally affected, we hope that there will be a far greater degree of integration than there is at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish now and allow my hon. Friends to speak. I hope that we can have a debate that is as wide-ranging as possible. This group of amendments—their selection in this respect has been most helpful—provides us with an opportunity for a very broad debate on a subject which we think is of considerable importance and which we hope will not be considered in a spirit of party controversy or in any partisan way. I hope that we can discuss this issue in a serious and civilised manner and that we shall receive reasonable compromises on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
points which we have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am here in the nick of time to speak to my amendments and perhaps to rescue the Opposition from the embarrassment of being rather short of Members on the Benches at present. The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has done a valiant job in virtually maintaining the Committee single-handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 85 and 86 in my name. We are dealing with a part of the Bill which has considerable all-party support. The only grudging note that any of us would utter is that although the legislative sanctions are provided to a greater or lesser degree in the clause the resources have still not been willed by Government. We hope that once the skeleton has been put on the statute book at least some of the flesh may follow to fulfil the duties in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first amendment, No. 85, seeks to strengthen clause 4, and to create a "duty" in relation to the under-fives. My second amendment, No. 86, following that paving amendment, would give an authority power in accordance with
	<br><blockquote><p>"section 61 of this Act (Examination and assessment of children and young persons) to establish which of them have special educational needs which are such as require continuing review and to open and keep a record of each such child and young person."</p></blockquote>
When I looked at clause 4 I felt that there was a weakness in the assessment position. In the Bill the Government are giving local authorities the task of making special provision for over-fives who require special educational assistance. At the same time, they are giving a non-mandatory power to local education authorities for under-fives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP amendments intend to make it a duty for education authorities to cater for under-fives with special educational needs. That is in line with the recommendations of the Warnock report, published in 1978. The report, probably the most authoritative document available on special educational requirements, said at page 57:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since a handicapping condition can become manifest at any time from birth, and since early education is crucial to the development of young children with special needs, we see no justification for any limit to the age at which steps can be taken to provide for the special educational needs of children."</p></blockquote>
At present Scottish authorities have power to assess children from birth and a statutory duty in the case of children over 5. Hence the amendment extends a provision which is already in existence. It should not require the employment of vast numbers of psychologists, specialist teachers and other experts, but there would be a value to parents and society as a whole which would far outweigh any addiitonal public expenditure which might be necessitated by the change.

	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
had not yet been supplanted by the right hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Lady was Secretary of State for Education and Science she made great play of the need for adequate nursery provision and pre-school education. Therefore I can say first to the Minister responsible for health and social work, who will be replying to the debate, that anything that he is prepared to concede to strengthening the recommendations made by the Warnock committee which are incorporated in the Bill will have the agreement of the Prime Minister. I am sure that the right hon. Lady would not like to go back on that part of her previous work as Secretary of State for Education and Science although I should not necessarily go out of my way to underwrite or underpin everything that she did in that controversial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the role of the under-fives who may be disabled or need special education. The Warnock report goes on to say—and from page 73 onwards the report merits reading by members of the Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The earliest years of life have enormous significance for all aspects of a child's development. … The period between birth and four years of age is generally accepted to be that of the fastest intellectual development, while the years between one and three to four normally see a rapid development in language … children with disabilities or significant difficulties will need to be elaborately taught things which other children learn and can learn spontaneously. Their education, therefore, must start as early as possible without any minimum age limit."</p></blockquote>
A whole range of educational works exist which emphasise the need for early assessment and education. Indeed, the Warnock report refers to a work by Swann and Mittler entitled "Language Abilities of ESN Pupils" of March 1976. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is evidence that for children with severe learning difficulties the years before six may be critical for their grasp of language."</p></blockquote>
For all children with physical or sensory disabilities, or who show signs of learning or behavioural problems, early education is the key to their individual development and the prevention or mitigation of later disturbances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its final recommendations, the Warnock committee —which sat for four years and instigated a wide range of research into the problems being dealt with by the Bill—defined the problems of the pre-school handicapped child as one of its two priorities. The second, incidentally, concerned the education of handicapped youngsters after the age of 16, to which the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Sterlingshire referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third priority was the expansion of teacher training in this area. On page 323, at paragraph 18.18 of the report, under the heading "A Special Education Staff College", the committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our proposals in this and other chapters, particularly for the development of in-service training, for research into the needs of children who require special educational provision and for a special education advisory and support service are all of them designed to enhance the quality of special education. There remains the question of who the competence of experienced administrators, advisers and teachers in special education can be further enhanced. They must be helped, through multi-professional conferences and courses, to develop approaches consonant with those of other professionals, particularly psychologists, doctors, nurses, social workers and careers officers. We know of no existing body able to co-ordinate and develop high level conferences and courses in this complex field."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
It therefore recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a body responsible for the further training of senior staff, which might be known as the Special Education Staff College, should be established. We hope that the facilities of the college would be available to senior staff in special education in Scotland and Wales as well as England."</p></blockquote>
At this point I could suggest that instead of closing one of the colleges of education, the Minister responsible for education would be far better advised, in the light of the Warnock report, to take care of the needs of children in Scotland, and devote one of the colleges under threat to specialisation in the needs of handicapped children requiring special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments carefully. I emphasise that this part of the Bill is not controversial in party political terms. It has a large degree of acceptance by all members of the Committee. I therefore ask that the Minister be prepared to accept advice on these matters, which is intended to be given helpfully, to improve the position for those of our Children who need special education and who, because of their disabilities and difficulties, deserve special treatment and a better start to life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is designed essentially to try to bring the clause more into line with the proposals of the Warnock report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having criticised the Munn and Dunning reports in the Committee, I should like to say that the Warnock report, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) has said, was one of the most substantial and far reaching educational reports we have had for some time. It made recommendations part of which—only a small part—the Government have incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome that small part, although we have reservations, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said earlier, in that there is a danger that if we try to implement those recommendations without giving sufficient finance we are raising hopes and perhaps creating further difficulties for the handicapped and those with special educational needs, because there may not be the resources in staffing or equipment to deal with them properly. Further difficulties will be created if that is allowed to develop without proper financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to help two major groups: first the pre-school and post-school pupil in need of special education, and, secondly, pupils of school age already in schools. The Warnock report is clear in two respects about what should be done. First, it says that there should be identification of children with special educational needs from an early age. Secondly, they should then be treated on an individual basis and not on some wide aspect of general disability. Thirdly, as far as possible—this is where amendment No. 75 comes in— the child should be integrated into the normal schooling process. According to Warnock, that was not to apply only to children of 5 to 16, but beyond that, too. The report recommended that they should be incorporated into the normal education service where it was feasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have one reservation about my hon. Friend's speech on the requirement of amendment No. 75—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do so would interfere unreasonably with the provision of the efficient education for the children with whom he will be educated."—</p></blockquote>
it is that he was using the example of the elephant man. I understand that that case was one of physical appearance disability rather than of mental disability or one that made it difficult for him to move or get around. We must be wary about that. If Warnock were fully implemented, physically and mentally handicapped children, particularly some with physical deformities, would be brought into the normal education system from a very early age. If those children were part and parcel of their peers who were normal and had no disabilities, that would go a long way towards their acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major problems of people with a physical disability that makes their appearance unpleasant and unacceptable is that they are often treated as a side show or horror show to be scorned and laughed at. If we bring these people into the education system as much as possible, as Warnock suggests, we not only get rid of the problem for that person but we get rid of the fear of the strange and the abnormal in the minds of other children, which will go a long way towards helping handicapped children to deal with society better than they do at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for coming back to the case of the elephant man. 1 chose that example because it is the subject of some concern at present. My reading of the situation is that it would be unfortunate if we were to go too quickly. In an ideal world these people would be part of the community. In many respects I was trying to cover my lines, but we could find our case undermined by people taking examples and saying that right away we would have the problems of total integration. Therefore, there is a considerable case for gradual acceptance. These people are members of the community, but their integration into the education system requires care, presentation and thoroughness, which the training suggested for teachers and for the community as a whole would have to encompass as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's point. I am sorry if I appeared to be hitting too hard at his example, but I believe that it was one of the underlying principles of Warnock that people with physical or mental disabilities should be integrated into normal society as far as is possible and that that process, to be effective, had to start at the earliest possible age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments, say, first, that local authorities should have not just a power but a duty to provide some form of pre-school education for those children identified as requiring special educational provision. Warnock was very clear on this point, and suggested four major components of such provision. First, it asks for
	<br><blockquote><p>"greater recognition and involvement of parents as educators."</p></blockquote>
To some extent, the clause takes account of that recommendation. Secondly—this is where we begin to hit more clearly at what the Government are doing— the report seeks
	<br><blockquote><p>"a substantial extension of nursery education for all children, since this would have the consequence that opportunities for nursery education for those with special needs would be correspondingly increased."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
Thirdly, it wants
	<br><blockquote><p>"an extension of peripatetic teaching services to cover all types of disability or disorder in young children."</p></blockquote>
Fourthly, it wants
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of professional help and advice from members of the various supporting services, including the proposed special education advisory and support service, to playgroups, opportunity groups, day nurseries and, above all, parents."</p></blockquote>
That is what Warnock said about nursery pre-school provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is worded, an education authority would have the power to make such provision, if it so wished, but it would have no responsibility to do so if it did not wish. In our view that is not good enough. It means that those education authorities which at present are not very good at providing nursery education for all children, or as many children as possible, would equally be those which would not provide special nursery education or the support services for pre-school playgroups and other groups of that nature required for special education. There is no question but that early identification and the earliest possible help for children with these learning difficulties are required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even at this stage such provision should be within the normal nursery school provision and not in special nursery schools, except for the few that are often provided. Those who work in nursery and play schools should have the ability, experience and training to be able to deal with children who have learning difficulties. Therefore, we are trying to provide two things. First, nursery education should be extended, which would automatically provide for those with special educational needs. Secondly, there should be training, expert advice and equipment provided by the local authority to nursery and pre-school institutions to help them to deal with children with special educational needs. That is the element of early identification and the element of ensuring that sufficient expertise is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment also seeks to bring the post-school educational needs into line with the proposals in the Warnock report. I accept that the report was written during the period of a Labour Government and not that of the present Conservative Government. It suggested that there should be expansion of post-school education in non-advanced further education as well as in schools. In other words, there should be two major prongs for children over the age of 16 who were still in need of education. First, if staying on at their secondary school was the best way forward, the school should have the staff to cope with that problem adequately. Secondly, the report suggested that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The expansion of further education provision planned by the Government over the next few years should afford considerable scope for improvements in provision for young people with special educational needs. As part of the education service's contribution to the provision of unemployed young people, 10,000 non-advanced further education places are to be provided in England, Scotland and Wales by 1981 -82."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, some places in non-advanced education should be made available for children over the age of 16 with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that most of us appreciate that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"The expansion of further education provision planned by the Government over the next few years"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
was obviously not written under the present Government, but under the last Labour Government, who were planning such an expansion. 1 shall be grateful if the Minister will tell us whether there are still to be 10,000 extra non-advanced places throughout the United Kingdom and how many of those places will be allocated to children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the last in the group of amendments— amendment No. 75—which deals with the core of the Warnock report. An education authority should have a duty to provide for special educational needs in ordinary schools. However, the report makes two provisos which, I think, are right. A child with a mental age of two could not cope with normal children aged 12 and upwards in a secondary school. That would be unreasonable, both to the child and to the other children. But where there is a minor disparity, perhaps of one or two years, between the mental and physical age of a child who in the past might have gone to a special school for the mildly mentally handicapped, we suggest that he should be integrated as far as possible into the normal school system, though his mental age may be below that of his peer group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of other children, and that proviso has to be included. However, the issue has to be examined as broadly as possible, and we ought to integrate as many children as possible, although it has to be accepted that the appearance of some mentally and physically handicapped children would create behavioural difficulties in the other children in the school and it might be better to send them elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the major provision is that as far as possible children should be integrated into the ordinary school system so as to train them to be part of normal society. Many of them would develop more in that situation than they otherwise would. However, it is not sufficient merely to state that and put a duty on the local authorities to carry it out. It requires far more than that, because many—though not all—schools in Scotland are not equipped at present to deal with the physically handicapped, nor do they have the equipment or, appropriate methods of working to train and help the mildly mentally handicapped child. If the amendment is passed the local authority will have a duty to provide the facilities and equipment to do that. I hope that the Government will be required to give some funds for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that many teachers do not have a clear idea of the needs of those requiring special education, and many do not have sufficient training in that area. I know that I may be lapsing into an area which you would not wish me to discuss at this stage, Mr. Gourlay, but there would be a need for teachers who are already in service to get some training in dealing with children with special educational needs. That would have to be done in colleges of education, but 1 know that you would not wish me to tread too heavily on that subject at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Warnock report to become too much of a Bible, as all major reports have some weaknesses as well as their great strengths, but Warnock was quite clear in suggesting that teacher training was an important element of the report and that, in all courses in colleges of education, there should be some form of
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
training in child development and in special educational needs. That would probably require a teacher training course longer than most present ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on to suggest that there should be a recognised qualification for some teachers in that area, and that there has to be special in-service training. All of those elements would be required if the amendment were passed, because if the education authorities have a duty to make that provision, they will need teachers in the schools who are capable of making it. Teachers, more than anyone else, provide education in that sense. If the amendment were passed we would have to have special courses of training for all teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly support all these amendments, because in my view the Warnock report was of considerable distinction. We all ought to be supporting it and doing everything that we can to ensure that its major proposals are carried out. Our suggestions in the amendments are in line with what the Warnock report suggested. We feel that the Government are going only a small part of the way towards what Warnock wanted. If we are genuinely to help those children with special educational needs, more is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our amendments will be supported by the new Government Back-Bencher—the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) seems to have resigned his Front Bench position; I think that everyone in education in Scotland will give three loud cheers at that. I hope that Conservative Members who express concern about children with special educational needs and about the handicapped will—in this International Year of Disabled People—vote for the amendments to ensure that we not merely pay lip-service to Warnock but do something specific about, it. The amendment are the means to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are very important. They refer to one of the priorities which were picked out in the Warnock report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report identified three areas of utmost priority in catering for the educational needs of disadvanted children. First, it had a provision for children under 5 years with special educational needs. At a later stage in the debate we shall come to the other two priorities: the provision for young people over 16 years with special needs and the priority of teacher training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to see that the Government are not giving enough priority in the Bill to the provision in the report for children under five years with special educational needs. We must remember that this is the International Year of Disabled People. The Ministers responsible for education and for health and paying lip-service to the needs of the disabled yet, when it comes to channelling resources to cater for their needs, there is little active response from the Government. If the Government were serious in their intent during this special year, the opportunity is now, in the Bill. It contains many bad elements but one of its better aspects is the beginning of a better legislative framework to deal with the needs of these children. I do not doubt that in general this part of the Bill is a slight improvement on the status quo. Nevertheless, unless the Bill is backed up by adequate resources, the Committee is wasting a lot of time and perhaps raising great expectations in the minds of many parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
All members of the Committee must have spoken to some of their constitutents who had a handicapped child in their family. At first, in many cases, it may appear to be a grave shock to the parents, particularly to the mother. The Warnock report refers to the importance of giving adequate support to both parents and to any other children in the family to help them cope with the arrival of a disadvantaged baby in the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disadvantage and deprivation begin at a very early age. Even children who are not physically or mentally handicapped can suffer from environmental deprivation. A great deal of psychological and educational research has been done in this area. It has pointed out the need to try to improve the opportunities for such children long before they reach school-entry age. If we wait until such children—particularly those who are severely handicapped—reach the age of 4 or 5, we will miss a great opportunity to improve their condition and the situation of their parents and the other children in the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing provision for the under-fives, the Warnock report referred to the need for greater recognition of the role of parents, and for the involvement of parents, wherever possible, as the main educators of their children during the earliest years. I think we would all accept that, not just for disadvantaged children but for children in general, the primary responsibility should rest with the parents. The parents should therefore be given the utmost support by the various advisory and back-up services, both at local government and, one hopes, central Government level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finding that there is a disadvantaged child in the family can be very difficult for parents. It can be, initially, a very traumatic experience. Yet although the arrival of a disadvantaged child may at first be seen as an extreme difficulty, in good families it often happens, oddly enough, that the presence of the disadvantaged child brings out in the family a great feeling of mutual respect, of respect for human rights and for other people's humanity, whether or not they are disadvantaged. I have often seen the bonds of family life, and the love between parents and their children, strengthened by the arrival of a disadvantaged child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Warnock report stated that there must be greater recognition and involvement of parents as the main educators of their children during the earlier years, it also referred to the need for a substantial extension of nursery education for all children. In fact, recommendation 10, drawn from chapter 5 of the report, is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"nursery education provision for all children should be substantially increased as soon as possible, since this would have the consequence that opportunities for nursery education for young children with special needs could be correspondingly extended."</p></blockquote>
The next recommendation is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Special nursery classes and units should be provided for young children with more severe or complex disabilities."</p></blockquote>
The report also emphasises the need for the continuation of parental involvement not just at home but also
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the work of nursery schools and classes."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the Government are doing enough
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
to implement those Warnock recommendations. The best way in which they could implement the recommendations on pre-school children would be to put a statutory responsibility on local education authorities to provide for the educational needs of a child as soon as that child had been identified and "recorded", to use the word in the Bill. If the child is recorded as being in need of special education, there ought to be the back-up of a statutory requirement on the part of the local education authority to fulfil that need. What is the point of identifying and assessing something and realising that there is a problem, unless we do something about it? Yet there is no statutory requirement at all in the Bill—until the child reaches school age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the reasonable amendment No. 79 in my name, and also some of the points raised by the other amendments which we are debating. The position is far from satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In chapter 5, paragraph 50, the Warnock report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nursery education has expanded modestly in recent years, mainly on a part-time basis. The extent of the provision is still insufficient. The proportion of two, three and four year olds attending maintained nursery schools and nursery classes in maintained primary schools in England and Wales in January 1977 on a full-or part-time basis is shown below."</p></blockquote>
The figures then show that at the age of 2 the proportion is 0.5 per cent, of the child population; at age 3, 15.3 per cent.; and at age 4, 14.9 per cent. The report, however, goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Scotland the position was marginally better, with nursery education being available in nursery schools and nursery departments in September 1976 for 16.6 per cent, of children aged three and four years."</p></blockquote>
Nevetheless, although we appear to be marginally better than our colleagues in England and Wales, all members of the Committee will agree that there is no room for complacency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing out the Scottish experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, will he refer to Dr. Margaret Clark's study of 1977 in the Grampian region? I am sure that as a Member of Parliament for that area he is well acquainted with the report. The report had a background of good will, in that not much opposition was expressed by teachers in playgroups and nurseries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that playgroups are voluntary organisations, as are opportunity groups. Will the Minister say whether he thinks that Dr. Margaret Clark's study could be extended to the rest of Scotland and whether the lessons which could be learnt from her research could be implemented as quickly as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information, and we await the Minister's reply with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember last year the proceedings on that wicked Education (No. 2) Bill relating to England and Wales, and also in parts to Scotland. The Government relaxed—from memory I think that they completely abolished—the statutory requirement for local education authorities to provide nursery education. I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
bitterly disappointed that Government Members who I was sure ought to be concerned about pre-school education once again saw fit to follow the Government Whip's instructions and to vote against the interests of pre-school education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is now water under the bridge. That decision was taken on the Floor of the House. Despite the constraints that have been put on the education budget—whether or not hon. Members agree entirely with those Treasury constraints, which 1 do not—when it comes to the provision of pre-school education we should all agree that the utmost priority should be given to children and parents who are most in need. It can be very demanding for a young mother, who may have other children, when a disabled child arrives who takes up a tremendous amount of her time, energy, devotion and sheer emotional effort. We should give priority to such families primarily in respect of better educational opportunity, to improve the education of the child. But it will also help the parents, especially the mother, and possibly the other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we want to see parental involvement in preschool education, there is a limit to the amount of time that a mother may be able to devote to the child if there are other children in the family. In many instances, the mother's first instincts are to devote more time to the disadvantaged child, so that there may be an interraction affecting other family members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when we think about priorities in respect of pre-school education, the first priority should be given to children with special educational needs. The best way to achieve that would be to place a statutory responsibility on the education authority to ensure that the special education needs of a child were met from the moment he was recorded as needing special education. It would not matter whether he was aged 2, 3 or 4. As with many aspects of this part of the Bill, it is not enough merely to place the statutory responsibility on local education authorities. They should have such responsibilities, but unless they receive Government back-up through the rate support grant, or through some new form of educational grant or increased capital allocation for special education at pre-school level in particular, the mere legislative framework will be seen as inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to respond both to the point about placing additional duties on the local education authorities, and to reply to what I said about the need to ensure that they receive enough encouragement and resources to carry out those duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is nice to be in charge of those parts of the Bill that are connected with my other responsibilities.

In your usual efficient way, Mr. Gourlay, you proceeded so quickly that the great speech that 1 intended to make on clause 3 stand part has gone unheard. I am not greatly worried about that.

I had intended to begin by thanking the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) for his kind remarks this morning in introducing the Warnock clauses. He said that he considered me to be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
person of some compassion. I hope that he will not have to change his mind when we reach the end of the two clauses, although I do not think that I shall be able to meet many of his requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing clause 4. The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire spoke of some of the amendments in his name. We were also pleased to have speeches from the hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr Wilson), Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). The hon. Member for Dundee, East said something which ran through the speeches of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, who is leading for the Opposition, and the speeches of all the other speakers. He said "Resources are not willed" and "The Government should inject finance". The Government are trying to set the framework of what the Bill can do for Warnock. Thereafter, if the finance is available, naturally it will be put to good use.

There are frequent remarks about "resources not being willed" or the injecting of finance. We all know— and I know especially in the other area of my responsibilities—that one could easily spend twice the present amount of money on the Health Service, but it cannot be so easily earned. Therefore, before the Opposition talk about the injection of finance and willing resources, they must decide in what other areas the money will not be spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The expenditure that the Government will undertake in areas such as defence—the £5 billion expenditure on Trident, for example—could endanger the lives of those that we seek to assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no sympathy with the Government's priorities. I am sure that savings could be made elsewhere, which would enable the Minister, if he had the will, to assist those whose expectations, for whatever reasons, have been raised by this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister will concede that we have not tried to raise the expectations of those who should benefit from the legislation, but the legislation will result in their expectations being raised, and it is up to the Minister to find the money and put his money where his mouth is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither a Minister nor the Government have any money; it is the taxpayer's money. The hon.

He is entitled to his opinion, but we believe that the first duty of a Government is the defence of the realm which, includes the people dealt with in the amendments. They need to be defended just as much as the rest of us do. If the Opposition have different priorities for spending the taxpayers' money, so be it. They are entitled to their view. Our order of priorities was endorsed at the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart started off again about willing finance, printing or borrowing money, or doing what we have been doing for 20 years. I turn to the two specific questions which he asked about nursery schools being the main providers of special education for under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
fives. That is not the case, because the majority of the provision for under-fives is made by home visiting, which even now is being developed by education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of places for the handicapped within further education, again it is a matter for education authorities to decide the extent of the provision for non-advanced further education. I am satisfied that the handicapped will be given a growing number of the places available. The White Paper recognised that this is an evolutionary process, rather than a change in direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Grampian survey of 1977 suggested that the largest area of provision was in day nurseries, and a connection between physical handicap and social deprivation was made. Will the Minister tell us what the percentages are for nursery schools, pre-school playgroups and opportunity groups, and day nurseries? In 1977 those figures in Grampian were 5.7 per cent, 10.3 per cent and 16.8 per cent. Will the Minister give figures to support his assertion that there is more care for the handicapped by means of home visiting than by any other means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member would not expect me to give the figures off the top of my head, although 1 shall certainly get them for him. But, as he is referring to his intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire, I can advise him that the answer to his question is that Dr. Clark's study, as he knows, of pre-school education and handicapped children was made in the Grampian region and was undertaken on behalf of the Warnock committee. In the light of that study, the Warnock committee recommended that the provision of nursery education be increased. The Government do not disagree, but, again, regard it as a matter for the education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with the amendments,! shall go on to the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire's contribution. He suggested that the Government had paid lip service to the International Year of Disabled People. I should like to refer him to a speech made recently by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), who used more than two pages to detail exactly what the Government are doing in the International Year of Disabled People. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire knows full well what we are doing, centrally, via local government, and via the various committees that we have set up. But I shall ask my hon. Friend to send the hon. Member a copy of his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know whether the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) can speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Chair would far prefer that I deal with the amendment, rather than make a speech about what we are doing for the disabled in Scotland this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it will be simpler and easier if I deal with the amendments in the way that the Opposition took them, because they do, as is said, hang together—a phrase that some of us may remember from a certain Scottish Grand Committee some years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
First, I refer to amendment No. 72. The position of pre-school children was raised on Second Reading, with particular reference to the importance of early identification of deaf children. We have, as promised, looked again at this, but we remain satisfied that it would not be right at present to place upon education authorities the additional financial and organisational burden of compulsory assessment at the pre-schol stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As at present, authorities will be obliged to comply with reasonable requests from parents for assessment. We are satisfied that, in practice, the service providing for pre-school deaf children is of a high standard. There is an additional objection to the compulsory assessment of the over-16s. Our approach to them has essentially been one of recording with consent, and we attach great importance to the involvement of the young person himself in educational decisions whenever possible, and we remain opposed to compulsion in this sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said covers amendments Nos. 79 and 85.1 turn now to amendment No. 76. Instead of making a long discourse, perhaps I may point out the effect of the amendment, which will explain why we cannot accept it. It appears to proceed on the false assumption that an education authority is required to provide education for recorded pre-school children. This is not so. New section 62(3) provides only that, where education is provided, it must include provision for special educational needs. The term "nursery provision" would include the day nursery provision made by social work authorities as well as nursery education provision. This again connects with amendments Nos. 72, 79 and 85.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We assume that a fair-minded Committee will support amendment No. 72, and that amendment No. 76 will be consequential upon it. If it is accepted that there is a duty on local authorities, it follows logically that there will then be an opportunity for the local authorities to make nursery provision available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are essentially dealing with children of school age, but I said that amendment No. 76 connected with amendments Nos. 72, 79 and 85, although that does not make it any easier to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I shall try to make some short remarks on amendments Nos. 77, 75 and 86, since I know that the Committee wants a short, brief and factual answer rather than long discourses. The problem about amendment No. 77 is that it raises to 19 the school leaving age for all recorded children and young people. It would therefore render inappropriate all references to young persons in clauses 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no quarrel with the intention which no doubt underlies amendment No. 75, of furthering the policy of integration. Indeed, I doubt whether anybody questions the desirability of placing handicapped children in ordinary schools wherever possible. Not only is the policy accepted in principle; it has been carried out in practice, as is shown by the fact that the number of children in special schools and classes is steadily falling, and would be falling even faster but for the fact that the constant development of special skills is helping to survive children who in earlier years would not have survived. For this fact alone all of us in the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
must be extremely grateful to the medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These facts also mean that there are more children in the years of schooling with very severe handicaps and multiple handicaps. It is recognised that some of these children need, and will continue to need, special schools. There is widespread understanding that the policy of integration, which was the whole thinking behind Warnock and on which we all agree, however desirable in general, must not be allowed to operate so as to deny severely handicapped children the special help and the special environment that they really need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Warnock committee was well aware of the situation. Although it, like everybody else, was in no doubt about the general desirability of integration, it emphasised also that the quality of education to be provided for handicapped children was the important thing, and that mere integration, divorced from participation on equal terms, was a meaningless concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I submit that the amendment is both unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because, as 1 have said, the movement towards integration is continuous and positive and also because the Bill will provide any further impetus that may be necessary by giving parents the right to appeal against any proposal to place their children in a special school if they think that a place in an ordinary school would be preferable and, if necessary, to have their request considered by the appeal committee in the light of a reconsideration of the professional assessment of their children by the Secretary of State. It is undesirable because I believe that there is a delicate balance in this sensitive matter and that a statutory provision of the kind that the amendment proposes would tend merely to upset that balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to make two points about amendment No. 86, which we have also discussed in this interesting debate. I cannot really understand the amendment. The words "young person" are defined in section 135(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person over school age who has not yet attained the age of eighteen years."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make section 	<i>62(a)</i> (ii) refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"young persons who are of school age",</p></blockquote>
but clearly no such young persons can exist, and the amendment would be of no effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the case of a young person who has left school and that he is trying to provide that the authority should have a duty to assess any such young person. That would not be appropriate, because, first, I would not want to place a duty on a public authority in such a case, since it is for the young person to decide whether he wants that kind of help. Secondly, the education authority's responsibility for him as a pupil has ceased, and the social work authority would have to consider what, if any, help he needed, and what help it could give him. I have no doubt that that authority would stand ready to give any help or advice that it could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In asking the Committee to reject the amendments, may I say that I have tried to deal with the specific amendments to the best of my ability, but I have also tried to answer the points raised during the debate by Opposition Members. There is much agreement in the Committee on the whole of the Warnock provisions,
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
but we return to the point of our wishing to get the framework right, and we shall continue to do what we can as soon as the finance is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed, although not entirely surprised, by that unhelpful reply. I shall deal first with amendment No. 72, which raises the question of deaf children, which was mentioned on Second Reading. I think that the rejection of this amendment will be a source of great disappointment because the Royal National Institute for the Deaf was not happy with the existing state of affairs, and specifically asked hon. Members to raise this question on Second Reading. Although the Minister undertook to look at it, we are disappointed that he has not accepted the case put forward by that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76, when taken in conjunction with amendment No. 72, means that the nursery provision available in a local authority area should not hinder the provision of nursery education for those with special educational needs. It is regrettable that the Minister has not been more sympathetic to the under-fives. My hon. Friends the Members for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and I have all made the point that this area is one of crucial importance, because those with special educational needs require educational opportunities. None of us here would be prepared to say that the existing facilities are adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not impressed by the macro-economic arguments which the Minister chooses to put forward to support this Government parsimony. Of all the groups, this is the most critical that Warnock was concerned about. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire made all too clear, the parents of this group are probably in the greatest need of assistance. It is a gross distortion of priorities to argue that the Conservative Party went to the election on a manifesto which said that Trident was more important than the needs of the under-fives—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without Trident there would not be any under-fives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that sedentary intervention as irrelevant. Since we do not yet have Trident and under-fives are surviving, the Minister's grasp of defence matters is about as strong as his grasp of educational issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point about the role of parents is that they themselves are educators. They have a special role, and they require the kind of assistance which would be available through an extension of nursery provision. While they would have the opportunity for some relief in the sense that the children would be taken off their hands, there is also the other important factor that the parents would be helped better to assist their children. I accept that the expansion of the health visiting system which has taken place since Warnock goes some way to assist them. Nevertheless, the opportunity to mix with other parents with similar problems and to be exposed to influences such as those which the nursery movement would provide would go a long way towards assisting parents and be of long-term good in helping the young
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very disappointed about amendments Nos. 72 and 76. There was an opportunity here for the Minister to break new ground. If he wanted to make a name for himself as a Minister, he had an opportunity here, where there would be no political opposition and no reluctance to spend public funds, since everyone is united in support of this cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 77 and the 16 to 19 group, the Minister seemed to suggest that our amendment was defective in that it would result in all young people being kept in special schools to the age of 19.1 tried to convey the Opposition's view in introducing this amendment, and I made clear that we did not want all youngsters between 16 and 19 to be kept at school. If the Minister does not like the wording of our amendment, he has the opportunity on Report to draft an alternative to tidy it up. If the Minister's only objection is that we should be committing all youngsters to remain in school with their special educational needs catered for, that is not the intention that we tried to convey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reconsider his view on amendment No. 77? Alternatively, if he will not reconsider it, will he accept that he has a responsibility, in the light of my correction of his misconception, to take the opportunity on Report to introduce an amendment of his own which would give young people between 16 and 19 the opportunity to stay on at school if that was desired by the parents? I know that they have an opportunity to stay on until the age of 18, but I do not think that at present they can stay until they are 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We chose the age of 19 because we realised that in these straitened times, where there is nowhere else for them to go, if the young people were allowed to stay within the educational establishments, where appropriate, for a longer period it would be of considerable assistance both to them and to their parents, who, when their children are at that age, suffer considerable anxieties about their future well-being. I said that the under-fives are at a critical age, but parents who see other youngsters who are not handicapped realising their full potential must find it all the more galling that, at the age of adolescence, when youngsters should be able to enjoy a degree of independence, their own children are still so dependent on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to amendment No. 75. We have endeavoured to make as many qualifications as possible. We do not want blanket integration. We reliase that there can be different forms of integration, and that integration in the form of units in schools is taking place at a reasonable pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has produced in evidence the reduction in the rolls of special schools. One could cynically observe either that there may well be a falling birthrate and consequently fewer children being sent to those schools or, alternatively, that there is not the money to support youngsters at special schools. We view with some caution the Minister's assertion that the fall in the number of youngsters at special schools necessarily means that the rate of integration is accelerating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we take on board the point that the locational form of integration affords opportunities to families to go to school together, and we recognise that the spin-offs in terms of the social aspects of integration —youngsters working together and growing up together
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
in the classroom—are very valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to brush those aspects aside. His attitude seemed to be that as the Government are all in favour of integration, it was not necessary to say any more about it. But this legislation, and the relaxed atmosphere of the Committee stage, give the Minister an opportunity to make the Government's commitment to integration clear and specific and to spell out the advantages of the different forms of integration. He has lost a great opportunity tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have qualified our acceptance of integration, but the Minister's somewhat cursory dismissal of what lies at the very heart of Warnock has greatly disappointed us. Perhaps most crucial of all, in what Warnock calls the functional form of integration, which involves either part-time or full-time participation in the work of the regular classes in schools, we expected the Minister to spell out the Government's view a bit more clearly and give some encouragement to those who are endeavouring to introduce that form of integration in a very unsympathetic economic climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not for a moment deny that integration has considerable financial implications. We do not deny that integration will probably necessitate smaller class sizes, better equipped classrooms and more time for teachers to prepare their work, to take account of the varying needs within the classroom. In the areas of integration, there would probably have to be a degree of back-up from the social workers, from health visitors and so on. All of this would cost money, but for the Minister simply to dismiss integration as being per se a good thing and not to go into any detail about it is a most unfortunate approach. Perhaps that was an error of omission on his part which he did not intend, and perhaps he would like to come back and express the Government's full commitment to this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of integration is at the very heart of Warnock. The parents' charter, for example, would probably afford to whole families the opportunity to go together to those schools which offer the units for integration. We do not assume that every school in every local authority will have a special unit, because that would probably involve too great a duplication of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school in my constituency which I instanced serves a fairly wide area, and it is working very successfully. But one would imagine that with the extension of parental choice authorities which have hitherto been unsympathetic would now be willing to allow the doors of those high schools which contain the units—the locational form of integration, to use the Warnock expression—to afford families the opportunity of going to school together. That would provide the necessary emotional support of which my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire spoke at some length, and with great feeling, in a moving part of his speech. I am not being cynical or trying to evoke false emotion. My hon. Friend's points were extremely important, because we are dealing with families who are under extreme stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a source of great disappointment to the Opposition that the Minister should have chosen, in the interests of brevity, to be so dismissive of this problem. I said earlier that he is a man of compassion, and I do not withdraw the description, but it is most unfortunate if he is so determined to push through the legislation that the obvious concern of parents in Scotland is to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has repeated one remark quite frequently. I hope that he does not think that sincerity and longwindedness necessarily go together on matters of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister speak at great length on many occasions, I am all too aware that that association is not necessarily correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the Minister has chosen not to accept any of the other amendments in the group. We shall obviously wish to return to them on Report, and therefore shall not push them to a vote now. We recognise that as the discussion on the Warnock report develops there will be a certain amount of to-ing and fro-ing on the different parts of the report and its relationship with the legislation. We hope that at the end of the day other influences will be brought to bear in that way. The Minister may then wish to reconsider some of the points which we have made, and perhaps a positive reinforcement of our message may get through to him eventually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to employ repetition, but we may make the same points in different ways in relation to different parts of the legislation. Therefore, at this stage we are not prepared to press the amendments to a vote. We hope that the fact that we are not doing so will enable us to return to them. I suspect that the debate will generate interest—though not in the press, since its representatives are sadly absent tonight—but we know that the pressure groups which have been in contact with many of us will be getting copies of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings and will see what the Minister has said and come back to us. We therefore hope that, in the light of this and subsequent debates, the Minister will be able to reconsider, if not the detailed wording, at least the thrust of the amendments. We want to see the local authorities' obligation extended to the under-fives and to those who at present we would regard as of post-compulsory school age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will therefore look again at his commitment to integration to see whether something along the lines of the American legislation would be possible, so that the Government can show that they believe in the principles of education, accept the message of Warnock and are prepared to provide the necessary financial backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not take kindly the Minister's view that somehow we are entering into something which is completely new. He says that he is creating a framework which will subsequently provide opportunities for local authorities to consider the best way of helping those with special educational needs. Over the years many pieces of legislation have been intended to do that. The fact that Warnock has been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman with some patience, but his speech has been largely repetitive, not only of his own arguments but of those of other members of the Committee. 1 should have thought that he could come to a conclusion in a fairly reasonable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have pre-empted me, Mr. Gourlay, because I was within about three sentences of the end of my remarks. 1 shall endeavour to complete those three sentences so that we may proceed and allow other hon. Members to take up some of the Minister's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that it is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that somehow the Warnock recommendations and this part of the Bill provide a brand new opportunity. There has been a variety of opportunity before and there is a great deal of knowledge and experience. It is wrong for the Minister to suggest that only after this legislation is passed will local authorities be able to start to consider how much money they need. If local authorities were given the opportunity and the encouragement, they would produce schemes tomorrow which would give the Minister the opportunity to find the finance. Given the opportunity and the Government's commitment, I am sure that the finance would be available. Certainly, there is a demand for such provision from the parents and the local authorities, and there may well be a mute demand from those youngsters who at present have special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up much of the Committee's time, but I wish to respond to one or two points that the Minister made in response to what I had said earlier. He said at the beginning that this was his first proper speech in the Committee. Having heard it, I have some reservations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the Minister used phrases in connection with financing this aspect of the Bill which he said that I had used but which I do not remember using. I believe that we have to have extra finance in education generally, but in the present situation that implies not spending more money but spending the same amount as before but on fewer children because of the falling rolls. Per capita the amount would go up, but the sum that we have spent over the past few years does not have to be increased. It can be left at the same level. The Minister should realise that we do not have to spend more money on education. If we spend the same amount, spreading it over fewer children, we shall have a better system. This Government are not spending more but are cutting the money for education. We argue that the same amount should be spent as Governments in the past have spent on education, to make some sense of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept some of what the Minister says about some local authorities having already moved to integration of the mildly handicapped into our schools —which is right—I believe that if we just set up this framework and go through the system of recording and ensuring that the children are identified, we shall be raising parents' hopes that something will be done about their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that we are not talking only about handicapped children. Some children who have learning difficulties at an early stage are not mentally handicapped in any way. They may have an emotional problem or a block that has to be got over, and they require special attention for a brief period. Once they are through that, they are all right, and they are not handicapped in the normal sense of the word. If we set up the framework without allocating funds to it, we shall be raising false hopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard the Minister give such a warm welcome
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
to the whole idea of integration of these children into schools and all that that will eventually mean to schools in terms of the methods by which teachers will have to teach in the classrooms, I am surprised that his hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is neither present nor taking part in the debate. The hon. Member for Argyll consistently attacks the idea of mixed-ability classes in secondary schools. If there are to be mildly mentally handicapped children in secondary schools, inevitably there will be mixed-ability classes. I am surprised that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A ridiculous argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, with respect, it is not a ridiculous argument. The whole methodology of schools will have to change if those children are to be properly integrated into the system. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 14, line 17, after "age", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(c)shall be under a duty to ensure that those young persons between 16 and 19 years of age shall be entitled to mandatory grants.'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment assumes that there will still be young people between 16 and 19 in institutions providing some form of special education. The provision of mandatory grants for the 16 to 19 age group is a controversial educational issue. I have great sympathy with those who are now enjoying full-time education courses, and I do not see the amendment as a dilution of the case for the expansion of the grant system to cover youngsters between the ages of 16 and 19. However, we are here dealing with a special group in the community who require financial assistance to a greater extent than probably any other. Depending on the type of disability there is often need for special clothing; depending on domestic circumstances there is often need for special furnishings in the home; depending on the type of disability, the diet of the youngsters could be more expensive. At a time when various forms of assistance are not being kept in line with the cost of living, and there is a fall in living standards, this group are more at risk and more in need than they have ever been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look to the provision of mandatory grants for the 16 to 19 age group as a small step towards the provision of financial assistance and, in some respects, a degree of financial independence for young people who will not be able to do the kind of things that other young people of their age can do. It is often argued that young people undertaking courses of study should be encouraged to take Saturday jobs, do paper rounds, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
find additional ways of earning money. For many youngsters that is an important part of the education process. But for the disabled and those with special educational needs, such avenues are not open. Such youngsters cannot easily get a Saturday job, do a paper round, deliver milk and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, account should be taken of this group's special economic circumstances. These youngsters are entitled to the dignity that economic independence affords. Even if the Government are not sympathetic to the grants and award system for young people between the ages of 16 and 19 in the community as a whole, this particular group merit assistance and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not gone into detail about the way in which the grant system would operate, the level of awards, or whether it would be means-tested and so on, because we wish to argue the principle in this instance. We are keen to make clear that the forms of assistance open to many disadvantaged groups in our society should be extended to the young handicapped. We realise that in some instances this is already part of the social security system, but we think that assistance through mandatory grants would afford these young people who are intellectually capable of being helped to achieve and enjoy a degree of independence and confidence in their ability to do the things that other young people can do. One of the most important is spending money. If people have money to spend, they can contribute to the economy and provide a variety of things for themselves for which at present they must look to their overburdened parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would not be a particularly expensive exercise. Because we have not indicated the level of grant, it would be invidious to ask the Minister how much such a scheme would cost, although if he is that hard pressed to object to it, I am sure that figures will come to hand eventually to show him how much it would cost, given certain levels of payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that this would be an important breakthrough for the help of the young handicapped. We recognise that there could be an arrangement, certainly for the 16 to 18-year-old group, for family benefits, although adjustments may be necessary, and for the 18 to 19-year olds, there may be need for flexibility. We are trying not to be too specific because we are seeking to give the Minister the opportunity once again to break new ground. If he is to be a reforming Minister for social work in Scotland, this is an opportunity that he should seize with both hands. Let him take on the hard-faced men of the Treasury. Let him seize this opportunity for a breakthrough. He should make a genuine attempt not merely to help the parents of those with special educational needs but to give those youngsters who are capable of spending it some money to spend. Unlike any other group of youngsters in that age range, they are not able to earn the money for themselves, because in most instances they are not capable of so doing.

I ask the Minister to look at this proposal sympathetically and give us the opportunity to say that at least some part of the Bill is worthy of a small measure of pride. We look to him to provide this group of youngsters with a degree of financial independence, which many of us believe lies at the heart of dignity in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). Again, we are dealing with a priority identified by Mrs. Warnock—the educational needs of 16 to 19-year-olds. I am in favour of a statutory responsibility being placed upon local education authorities to provide for those educational needs, but obviously that must be tied in with adequate financial assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the present system of financing students, particularly handicapped students, requires a great deal of re-examination and improvement. Many parents of handicapped children may not be aware of this, but it is already possible for assistance to be given through the Supplementary Benefits Commissions. Warnock understood that the commission took the view that
	<br><blockquote><p>"benefit can be paid to a young person aged 16–19, even though he may be continuing at school or in further education, if he is physically or mentally handicapped and his prospects are so poor that, were he to leave school or college, he would be unlikely to be able to enter employment within a reasonable period of time."</p></blockquote>
I know that some voluntary organisations, such as the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, are going out of their way to try to advertise that among parents. I only wish that the Minister also would go out of his way to explain it—if that is still Government policy and if they are still encouraging the Supplementary Benefits Commission to take that view. If so, will the Government make greater efforts to inform parents of handicapped children of their rights in that respect? I know of several parents who would never have known of their rights had they not learnt them of through membership of a voluntary organisation, or perhaps by coming to my surgery. Thus, there is a scheme for certain categories of young handicapped people who decide to stay on at school or go on to further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree in principle that any recorded young person should have that right, and there should be a financial incentive for him to continue his education. I believe this to be a good educational principle for all children. It would encourage them to stay on at school, because at present a financial penalty is imposed on many families. The present critical unemployment affects particularly children and young people suffering from handicaps. Surely, we should encourage as many young people as possible, particularly handicapped young people, to stay on at school if the type of course offered will benefit them. In many cases such financial assistance would be a form of investment because it would improve their training opportunities and thus improve their employment opportunities, thereby giving them the chance to contribute something to the betterment of the economy or society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not make sense that some young people— including the handicapped young people about whom we are now talking—should suffer a loss of income if they leave college. Both the individual young person and the family suffer a loss of income. It also seems strange to me that if they go to junior, or even senior, occupational centres they qualify for supplementary benefit, but they may not qualify for supplementary benefit if they continue at school or take a course at a college of further education, unless they come into the categories that I have just defined of the Supplementary Benefits Commission's interpretation according to the Warnock report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
The best way to deal with the anomalies in the system is along the lines of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire. Warnock points out that in Scotland the responsibility for the financial support of handicapped young people who wish to continue their education is divided between the education authorities and the Scottish Education Dept. At present the Scottish education authorities have discretionary powers to assist persons, including handicapped students, who are ordinarily resident in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main kinds of assistance. There are higher school bursaries for those who remain at school beyond the statutory school leaving age to complete their secondary education, and there are further education bursaries for students attending full-time courses of non-advanced further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a handicapped young person goes on to higher education, whether at university, a college of education, a central institution or any other courses that qualify under the Scottish Education Dept's. Scottish students awards scheme, he's entitled to a mandatory grant. Some physically handicapped students go on to university. Some at Stirling university in my constituency have attained high achievements in higher education and gone on to do research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a better approach to the financing of students. The Opposition favour the introduction of a mandatory awards scheme for all young people undergoing full-time education beyond the statutory school leaving age. It will certainly not be done overnight by the Government, but if we draw up a list of priorities, handicapped young people who want to stay on at school or who want to go on to college or university should be put at the top. If they are sufficiently able to enter university they qualify for a mandatory grant, possibly with a supplementary allowance over and above the minimum grant that comes under the Scottish Education Dept's. student award scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it strange that we cater for the special educational needs of the high flier in that respect, yet we do not cater to the same extent for the educational needs of the more severely handicapped and disadvantaged. The best way to put that right is by means of amendment No. 78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that when the Minister replies to the debate he will give us the same old story about a shortage of resources, but how on earth can he justify dishing out £3| million—a sum that will increase over the years— to those who want to go to private fee-paying schools? He could start by scrapping the assisted places scheme and by putting that money into a mandatory award scheme for the young who are most in need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) began his speech in support of the amendment he quoted the first part of paragraph 10.109 of the Warnock report, which explains how the Supplementary Benefits Commission has a discretionary power to award grants to 16 to 19-year-olds under certain circumstances. The report was produced before the reorganisation of supplementary benefit, and discretionary awards have been changed. Will the Minister find out how that affects those who have been in receipt of such grants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend omitted—I think rather unfortunate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
ly—to continue his quotation from paragraph 10.109 of Warnock, because it went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were concerned to learn that in 1976 only about 700 handicapped people were receiving benefit on these grounds."</p></blockquote>
That is 700 in the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the report, which refers specifically to Scotland, continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In practice there seems to be a considerable variation between different areas in the way in which the Commission's discretionary powers are exercised and a greater readiness to pay supplementary benefit to young people with an easily recognisable physical disability than to young people with learning difficulties"—</p></blockquote>
the Bill provides for those who have obvious disabilities, as well as for those who have learning disabilities but who might appear to be perfectly normal physically—
	<br><blockquote><p>"even though the employment prospects of the latter"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
that is those with learning difficulties who appear to be normal physically—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be very poor. We recognise that to attempt to define more clearly the group of handicapped people for whose benefit the Commission may use its discretionary powers in this way could in practice restrict it even further than at present. In the interests of greater uniformity of practice, however, we urge local officers to consult the local careers officer and the Disablement Resettlement Officer as to whether or not a handicapped young person is likely to be able to enter open employment."</p></blockquote>
That is a recommendation for action which does not cost money and will therefore attract the Government. They are all for anything that is free, even if it is just a promise, a declaration of intent, which is really what these clauses are. We shall return to that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
