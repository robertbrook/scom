	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly respond to the potential problems raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). Although he is not here to hear my reply, no doubt he will read the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was slightly concerned that my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) was inclined to accept his amendments and was anxious to know their implications for any grants that might be made by the Countryside Commission to an applicant under these provisions. I was telling the Committee that, although, if the amendments were accepted, a maximum percentage would no longer be laid down by the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend would, through his normal relationship with the Countryside Commission, be able to ensure that there was no abuse of public funds. The likely procedure would be the issue of a circular to the Countryside Commission and to local authorities, ensuring that the proper criteria were applied when any payments of this kind were contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these words will reassure those who were concerned about this issue. On that basis, I am sure that the Committee would be safe in accepting amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8, although, for the reasons that my hon. Friend correctly pointed out, amendment No. 5 tabled by the Opposition would be inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for his absence from the Committee today. I understand that he has an urgent constituency engagement and that he is at this moment in Glasgow. I therefore have the doubtful privilege, as one of the sponsors of the Bill, of standing in his stead as devil's advocate on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the sponsors of the Bill, including myself, have accepted this group of amendments. It might be worth our while to raise one or two further points in a stand part debate, but I do not think that there is much to be gained from further detailed debate on these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thankful that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) accepted the group of amendments that the Committee has just agreed to. A number of hon. Members thought that paragraph 2 of schedule 4, with its references to resolutions by the Houses of Parliament and so on, seemed to bring statutory considerations into what were supposedly voluntary agreements between local authorities, the Countryside Commission and landowners. In those circumstances, it appeared that the hon. Member for South Angus was trying to introduce an entirely new phenomenon into British statute law—namely, compulsory agreement. However, we have overcome that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman and the Minister some questions about the further provision of access agreements and about the access agreements themselves. How have they worked in the past, and how is it envisaged that they will work in the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the transactions covered in the clause will in effect be payments made for access agreements out of Countryside Commission money, through the agency of local authorities. They will involve three elements. First, there will be a capital
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
contribution towards the value of the access— whatever that might be. I have no doubt that district valuers will have considerable difficulty in working out the capital value of an access which does not in itself include the ownership of land, or of anything else so far as I know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there will be an element for the legal costs involved in the operation. Thirdly, there will be an element to cover the cost of facilities which will be made available to the public so that they may take advantage of the access. I imagine that the latter will include stiles, bridges, fences, signposts and such things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this the best way of carrying out this provision? Will the introduction of these rather complicated access agreements stand the test of time? A given landowner may be happy to undertake obligations under such an agreement now, and to tie himself up in the machinery set out in these clauses, but might not these arrangements fall into abeyance in due course—either under the present landowner or under his successor? I am thinking of repairs—to footpaths and, in particular, to bridges. They should be covered by this legislation, but they could fall into disrepair, and we might find that no real progress had been made in spite of the high-sounding intentions lying behind these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might there not be a better way to approach this matter? If the local authorities were given the responsibility for maintaining stiles, bridges, footpaths, and so on, they would at least be accountable to the public. Under these provisions the obligation will be placed, by the agreements, on landowners, and it will be difficult to compel them—except through the courts—to carry out their obligations. Therefore, public money could be paid to landowners under these new arrangements, but the obligations which the money is to fund might not be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of umpteen examples. What could be more important than a footbridge for public access? However many rights of way and paths are provided, if there is a great gaping gorge with a deep burn flowing through the bottom of it, and if the bridge has fallen into disrepair and is unsafe, the public access is hardly worth having. I am concerned that we could find ourselves with bridges which, in time, even after they had been repaired and set up in the enthusiasm generated by the introduction of the legislation, would fall into disrepair and become unsafe. Who will ensure that they are repaired, after public money has been contributed towards their repair? It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could say more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has given me copious notes— which I am having great difficulty in interpreting. He was concerned about references to resolutions of either House of Parliament. He said that they were not necessary. The hon. Member may have included these provisions in the original drafting
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
because he was worried about extravagance. But surely section 13 of the 1967 Act, which says that local authorities may make grants with the approval of the Secretary of State, covers extravagance? However, perhaps it is not relevant to go into that issue because the hon. Member has already accepted the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have said enough on the clause stand part debate, but I should be grateful if the hon. Member would say how he envisages that the access agreements will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably useful if I say a few words now about access agreements and the improvements which clause 3 will make in the arrangements for their introduction in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spelt out before that under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 provision was made for planning authorities to enter into access agreements. The problem had been that it was virtually impossible for the district valuer to work out the amount he should pay the landowner to secure that access. In very beautiful and important parts of Scotland there were examples of that—in Torridon, Glencoe, Ben Lawers, and so on—where access, although secured, could be secured only at a nominal figure because there was no way that the district valuer could assess the value of the access to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that it is a matter of agreement. Some points which the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has raised seem to proceed on the basis that in effect there is a rigid agreement into which the local authority, or anyone else, such as the Countryside Commission, might have to enter. That is not so: it is a matter of agreement. A number of such access agreements already exist in Scotland. No fewer that 53 have already been concluded, and about another 20 are presently under negotiation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member made a fair point about the upkeep and repair of bridges and footpaths. That would vary according to the access agreement entered into by the local authority and the landowner. In some circumstances, the local authority would itself assume the responsibility for the upkeep of the bridge or the path. On the other hand, if the landowner were using it for his own purposes as well as providing access to the public, it would be more appropriate for him to continue to have incumbent upon himself the obligation of repair and maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not rigid within any confines: it is a matter of agreement and can be varied to suit the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explanation is helpful. Would the same apply to public liability insurance on these accesses? That is probably an important consideration, and insurance ought to exist wherever there is public access. Someone could be injured by falling over a bridge or by a branch falling on his head. Public liability considerations are relevant, and it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could say whether that liability will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
still lie with the landowner, or whether it could be tied up in an access agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that public liability would be covered by occupier's liability as enshrined in statute already. Insurance to deal with that particular liability could be covered by agreement. Responsibility in such circumstances is set out clearly in the occupier's liability legislation. So far as I am aware, there has never been a problem about who should bear the cost of a public insurance policy premium when setting up access agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RELAXATION OF POWERS OF SECRETARY OF STATE IN RELATION TO ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC ACCESS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 7, leave out from "or" to "acquire" in line 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 deletes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
from clause 4. It is relevant that we should have a short debate on this issue if only because the description of the clause and the paragraph refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Relaxation of powers of Secretary of State in relation to acquisition of land for public access",</p></blockquote>
yet it appears that the Secretary of State's powers would be reinforced by the insertion of those words. It might be useful if the hon. Member could comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the amendment proceeds on a misapprehension of what is set out in clause 4. I do not say that in a snide fashion, because it is possibly difficult to understand clause 3 unless one also considers the sceond schedule, which repeals part of section 24 of the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simplest way for me to explain clause 4 to the hon. Gentleman is to quote the way in which clause 24(1) of the 1967 Act will read in total if we assume that both what is proposed in clause 4 and the repeal set out in schedule 2 are implemented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to a local authority, as respects any land in their area which is or which gives or forms part of access to open country,—
	<ol>
	<li>that it is requisite that the public should have access to that open country for open-air recreation; and</li>
	<li>that in the circumstances it is expedient that for that purpose the land should be acquired by the planning authority ".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
This is the important point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority may acquire the land by agreement, whether by way of purchase, feu, lease or excambion, or, with the consent of the Secretary of State, acquire the land compulsorily: provided that the authority may not acquire the land compulsorily unless it is impracticable to obtain such access by an access agreement or an access order."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
Section 24 of the 1967 Act states that the consent of the Secretary of State is necessary at present even if land is to be acquired by agreement. It is an unnecessary step to ask the Secretary of State for his consent when land is simply to be acquired by agreement. The side note to the clause is appropriate. It is a relaxation of the Secretary of State's powers in relation to the acquisition of land for the public when it is acquired by agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a local authority seeks to acquire land compulsorily, in accordance with all other compulsory purchase legislation it is appropriate that the authority should receive the Secretary of State's consent. It seems to be a reasonable safeguard in the interests of those persons whose land might be acquired compulsorily, but, where the owner agrees that his land should be purchased, it seems unnecessary to go to the Secretary of State. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels free to withdraw this amendment as, from its very terms, it seems that he has misunderstood what is being proposed when the clause is read together with the schedule of repeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the helpful explanation which the hon. Gentleman has given the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 9, leave out from "unless" to end of line 11 and add
	<br><blockquote><p>"there has been a failure to obtain such access by an access agreement".</p></blockquote>
It will be clear to the Committee that this is yet another probing amendment. It seeks to discover from the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) the meaning of the word " impracticable". The amendment would replace the final two lines of the clause so that they read
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless there has been a failure to obtain such access by an access agreement".</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would make it clear to the Committee under what circumstances he envisages that it would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"impracticable to obtain such access by an access agreement or an access order".</p></blockquote>
This is a reasonable point which, I hasten to confess, was winkled out by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr Dewar) rather than by me. I feel that it merits some brief discussion or explanation at this stage for the benefit of those who will be involved in these agreements in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal briefly with this amendment. Again, I hope that once I have given a brief explanation, the hon. Gentleman will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment would remove the condition that, before land can be compulsorily acquired, it must be impracticable to obtain an access order. The amendment provides that there should already have been an unsuccessful attempt to obtain access by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
an access agreement. I point out to the hon. Gentleman that in the original wording of the clause it is a matter of impracticability of obtaining access not only by an access agreement but also by an access order, whereas his amendment makes reference only to an access agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compulsory acquisition of land is generally to be regarded as the method of last resort for the purpose of securing public access. If agreement cannot be reached on access, the next step should be to seek an access order which, generally speaking, would be both less restrictive on the owner and less costly to the authority than proceeding directly to compulsory acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks in what circumstances one might anticipate that it is impracticable, as the clause suggests. It is envisaged that this might happen where the value placed on access was so high as to make outright purchase more appropriate if the proposal introduced for annual payments or the like was so high that the simplest and most economic way of proceeding would be simply to purchase the land outright. Alternatively, circumstances might be that it was impossible to identify the owner of the land. In that case again, compulsory acquisition would be the appropriate way to proceed. In those circumstances, the Secretary of State would want to be satisfied that the authority had done what it could to discover the identity of the owner, had failed to do so and that the appropriate way to proceed was by compulsory acquisition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation which will, no doubt, be studied carefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden and perhaps referred to at greater length on Report. In view of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL PARKS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 3, line 13, leave out ' and extensive in size'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 18, in page 3, line 14, leave out 'a substantial number of'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to try to discover what the hon. Gentleman has in mind in his proposals for regional parks. There are various kinds of parks in the country and parks of a different kind are under discussion in another place in relation to the Wildlife and Countryside Bill [Lords]. It would be useful if we had a clear picture of what a regional park, as described in the clause, will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of the amendments seeks to exclude the words "and extensive in size". It would be useful
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
to understand precisely what that means. What is an extensive piece of the countryside? Are we talking about several square miles, or a few acres? What is the relevance of the inclusion of these words? Are there not better criteria for describing what it is desirable that a regional park should be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second of these amendments seeks to remove the words "a substantial number "If the amendments were to be accepted, the beginning of the clause would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>" A regional park is a park, set in the countryside located so as to be convenient to serve the recreational needs of the inhabitants of the area."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand the provision that it should be
	<br><blockquote><p>" convenient to serve the recreational needs of a substantial number of the inhabitants ".</p></blockquote>
Surely it is either beneficial to the inhabitants or it is not. I do not see the need to refer to a " substantial number ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I wonder why we are talking about the inhabitants of the area at all. Presumably one of the main objectives of the clause is to make these parts of the countryside available not only to the inhabitants of the area but also to inhabitants of urban areas in other parts of Scotland or elsewhere. Perhaps that qualification could be scrutinised and subjected to comment. Surely a regional park or any park that will serve a useful purpose for the inhabitants of Scotland should be convenient and relevant for those in urban areas as well as those in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would respond as briefly and concisely as usual to my comments. Perhaps the Committee will then have a clearer picture of what he has in mind when talking about regional parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Together with other members of the Committee, I have received a letter about the use of the word " park ", which the writer thought would give the public the idea that they could roam everywhere. He was concerned about agriculture and interference with the growth of crops and so on.

I think that he was more concerned about the designation of a park than about the principle of the clause. Does the hon. Gentleman have any idea of changing it? I confess that I see great difficulties in that, since that is the word generally used for that kind of amenity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Myles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up the point raised by the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) about the use of the word " park ". I am a farmer with a fair amount of land on which the public may roam. We do nothing to stop them, and I would not wish to do so. But I believe that to speak of a " park " creates an impression of a place where the public have a right to do just about anything. I believe that we ought to think very carefully about designating such areas in such a way that the regional councils would have not just the opportunity of planning in these areas but also control of the public in the areas, rather than calling them parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I did not disagree with the decision of the House to give my Bill an unopposed Second Reading, there has, as a result, been no opportunity to explain certain principles in the Bill. What has been said by those members of the Committee who have spoken indicates that it might be appropriate for me to explain briefly what a regional park is and how it fits into a scheme of parks for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take up first the point made by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). A regional park is envisaged as being extensive in size. It is not envisaged as an area of 100 acres wholly owned by a local authority. Within it there will be a mix of privately owned land and country parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the clearest example I can give is that of the very worthwhile initiative taken by Strathclyde region in setting up its regional park at Clyde Muir-shiels, This is an extremely exciting concept, and it is wholly Scottish in origin. I am very sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin), who has given great support to the Bill, is not present to hear a Conservative Member paying a compliment, for once, to the Labour-controlled regional authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear; about time, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary to distinguish the regional park from the national park as it exists in England. The national park authority is its own planning authority. It can do a great deal more than it is envisaged that it would ever be possible to do within a regional park. The national park also has funds from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help me define the essential features of a regional park, I shall refer to a document prepared by the Countryside Commission for Scotland entitled " A Park System for Scotland ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We see these regional parks, where recreation is the dominant form of land use in selected parts only, as larger and more diverse in character and ownership than a country park and so less suited to a unified management programme. Regional parks are intended to provide a comprehensive system of public access to countryside, ranging from areas of nil or low recreational use to sites used intensively, including picnic sites and possibly one or more country parks, and linked by footpaths or wider areas over which access agreements could be negotiated. Because of the diversity of land use and their size, such parks cannot be regarded as being merely large country parks."</p></blockquote>
It should be emphasised—this is a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Myles) may be concerned about—that within a regional park one would expect to find, and to continue to find, large amounts of privately owned land. Although the public might enjoy that land because of its scenic quality, I would not suggest in any way that because that land is included in a regional park it should necessarily be wholly available for public access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasis that the designation of a regional park would not provide any new powers of land
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
acquisition or control to the local authority, but it would indicates that the area was one in which the regional council, by means of its existing powers to make access and footpath agreements, would try to extend the land available for public recreation as and when that was warranted. There would be no impact on ownership of the land within the regional park, and no attempt would be made to take it over wholly. Part and parcel of the concept is that the land should be privately owned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of a name for such a park. It is a difficult question. I believe—as the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) has pointed out—that a number of representations have been made to all members of the Committee suggesting that " regional park " is an inappropriate name because it might give the public the idea that access within that area was unlimited and unrestrained. The matter has been discussed in great detail by the working party set up by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), to look into improvements in countryside legislation in Scotland, and by others before that. With the NFU, the Scottish Landowners' Federation and individuals the difficulty has been that no one has come up with a better term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only alternative appears to be that it might be called a " management area ", which sounds even more bureaucratic and unpleasant than "regional park". I found the proposal that it might be called a "control zone" the most horrifying of all. That term seems to have more to do with a civil defence operation than the provision or recreation in the countryside for people from our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise that there is some anxiety about the proposal in Scotland, I do not think that any one has come up with an alternative. If a sensible alternative were offered, I think that the Countryside Commission, the regional authorities, or I, would be prepared to look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Myles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any sudden solution or any better designation; but when we start to expand the use of words, we can get into difficulty. A " park" in Aberdeenshire is just a field, and "park ", when it is spoken of in an urban area, is a place in which children play, an open, greenfield area. When the word " park " is extended to refer to massive areas—for example the Queen Elizabeth park right up at Balmiaha and Rowardennan, in the Strathclyde region. I think that that is confusing. We should try to get a better designation so as to use the- same word for all sorts of things in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I appreciate that the word " park" may have caused some anxiety and possibly some confusion in certain circumstances. However, starting in the Rockies, and moving eastwards, there has been use of the word " park ", which does not merely encompass the idea of a small area of grass and shrubs in a city centre, to which people can have unlimited access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
in England, where we have national parks already, a farming activity much beloved of my hon. Friend the Member for Banff—hill farming—is carried out very successfully. I would emphasise that although, as I have said, a very brave and worthwhile initiative has been taken by the Strathclyde regional authority, it has been found in England that although farmers may start off with a sense of hostility to what has happended, they have found that the ranger service operated in such a regional park eventually operates to their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example that was given to me when I was in the Strathclyde regional park on Friday was of one hill farmer who had been extremely suspicious of the new scheme until one of the rangers had caught someone who had gone there quite independently with his Great Dane, which had savaged and killed two sheep. The rangers had apprehended this man from Greenock and had arranged that the compensation should be paid to the hill farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, once people understand it, it is an arrangement that should operate to the mutual benefit of the public—who are getting greater access than they would otherwise have had, not through an extension of powers but because of the way in which the network is elaborated upon—and of those carrying on legitimate rural pursuits of farming and the like, who will enjoy greater protection in their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, to take the Pentlands for example, one of the difficulties is that people are going up there anyway. Half a million people in the greater Edinburgh area regularly take access to the Pent-land Hills. It is clear that that is already causing some difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through this concept and its development we are trying to provide a better balance, so that the legitimate recreational desires of those who live in the cities can be satisfied and they can get into the countryside. But at the same time, we are not destroying perfectly legitimate agricultural pursuits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Myles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggested something that could be acceptable—simply " access area ". That would designate an area to which the public had access. They have access anyway, but that phrase would not put in their minds the idea that they had all the rights of a park.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could get into a fairly involved semantic argument over that point. If the terminology " access area" were adopted, it would convey to me the idea that I could go all over anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Myles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But possibly the one point that I have not made clear is that within the regional park there would be opportunities. There would be country parks, as there are already in the Clyde Muirshiels park, where there are fairly large areas and lochs where one can walk or sail or undertake that kind of intensive recreational activity. Then, linking up these country parks through private land,
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
where the traditional rural pursuits will continue unabated, there will simply be a right of access, and the scenic beauty of those private areas will be enjoyed by the public. It is clear from the way in which the concept has been operated that it is necessary to continue to have the term " extensive" within the definition of a regional park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the words " a substantial number " are not as important. But I hope that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will at least seek to withdraw amendment No. 17 relating to " extensive in size ", because we want to establish the clear distinction between a regional park and a country park, which is a much smaller area of land and one that is operational in Scotland already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly support the clause and, as the Member for Pentlands, comment on some of the observations that have been made with regard to the application of a clause of this kind to the Pentland Hills and to other comparable areas, taking up in particular, the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Myles).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that, if a clause before the Committee put an unfair or, indeed, a new burden an those engaged in agricultural or other work on their own land, it would be unacceptable, certainly to my hon. Friends and I presume to the Committee as a whole. It is perhaps right that the debate has centred on the words used rather than on the powers because no new powers are provided under the clause that would in any way jeopardise the position of those who indulge in farming interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read with interest the letter received by all members of the Committee from Mr. Marshall of West Linton, which particularly referred to the Pent-land Hills. To some extent, he may have been under a misunderstanding, because in his letter he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have suffered for some time from members of the public who think that the Pentlands are already a Park and that they can do what they like where they like, with no regard for those who earn their living on the land."</p></blockquote>
That is a problem at the moment irrespective of the designation of the area in question, but I think that my hon. Friend can be absolutely assured, as can Mr. Marshall, that his rights of access to his land as a private landowner are not in the slightest affected by any provision of this Bill or by any designation of an area as a regional park. If a regional park includes land that is privately owned, it will be entirely a matter for the owner of that land to determine who shall have access to it in the same way as he can at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Myles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can point out the kind of difficulty that is in my mind, quoting again the case of Queen Elizabeth park up at Rowardennan, which goes right up to Ben Lomond. I have a very good friend who farms that area and, as it was designated a park, he wanted to put an access road through the hill in order to feed the sheep in winter and improve the area. Because the area was planted, it meant that the road would be a fair old scar on the landscape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
My friend got permission for the road, but because it was designated a park, all the conservationists and everybody else looked at the scheme and made all sorts of objections. The cost of making the road escalated in the two years of planning, argument and everything, and he had to pay about five times more for making the road than he would otherwise have had to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that to designate land as " park " gives an idea to all those conservationist bodies and others that they have to look after the area themselves especially, and it raises planning difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct in that inevitably any landowner who owns land in one of the more beautiful parts of Scotland which is an area of high scenic quality will find that he will have difficulties over planning applications that those less attractive areas will not have. Whether the land in question is technically called a regional park or has some other designation is probably irrelevant. Those who are interested in conservation and in the appearance of the countryside are well aware of the areas of greatest beauty. These areas will indeed always be drawn to the local authority's attention and the argument will be made about them that extra controls and restrictions should be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend looks at clause 5—it is the effect of clause 5 that concerns us at the moment— he will see that subsection (2) specifically refers to the regional councils having power to administer
	<br><blockquote><p>"any parts of any such park which are under the control of the council".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the only direct power that the local authority will have is over land which it owns or for which it has a management agreement entered into voluntarily by those concerned. Therefore, the clause has not introduced a specific new power over the landowner. That is the important consideration which should reassure both Mr. Marshall and others involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend quite properly and rightly emphasised the general advantages of a regional park concept, which has worked perfectly well in other parts of the United Kingdom. In a sense it already works informally within Scotland. It is to give a more sensible general structure to the system that is evolving in Scotland that a clause of this kind is, in the Government's view, a sensible and desirable improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for having initiated this brief debate and for the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and my hon. Friend the Minister have responded. If nothing else, the debate will have been extremely helpful in clarifying to the many people involved, either as people farming in the areas or as people seeking access to them to enjoy the countryside, matters which have not been entirely clear. I hope that it will encourage people, when they go into these regional parks, to recognise that other people live their lives there and earn their livings there.
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
In order to continue the enjoyment of the countryside in this way for the largest number of people, there is an onus on those using the regional parks to respect the livelihoods and living conditions of those who live there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson), I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) for giving us an explanation of what the regional parks are likely to be, which will be helpful to all concerned. My understanding is that they will be a second tier of park on top of the existing country parks, which I imagine will be parallel to the national parks in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably worth commenting here that the Countryside Commission report on this question, which was published in 1974, specifically recommended that we should not have national parks of that type. Therefore, I wonder what parallels there are between English and Welsh national parks and the regional parks proposed by the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may emphasise this point again, as it is one about which my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Myles) is worried. If we were to introduce into Scotland the concept of national parks, we should be taking very extensive powers that no regional authority has at present in Scotland and which are much greater than those proposed here. As my hon. Friend the Minister has said, if we were doing that, we should have to look very carefully at such a concept. The provision brings together a framework within which existing powers operate. I hope that, by the passage of the clause into law, we shall have given the approval of Parliament to the considerable efforts that not only Strathclyde but other regional authorities in Scotland are contemplating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These comments are helpful. We have been going a little wide in this debate and have gone into the question of the name that should be given to these parks and whether they should be called parks at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was aware that we were going rather wide of the amendments immediately under discussion, but it seemed to me worth while from two points of view. First, there was no Second Reading debate on the Bill and, secondly, by allowing the debate to go a little wider, I might have obviated the need for a stand part debate on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that might have been what you had in mind, Mr. Lamond. In view of that, I hope that you will not mind if I make one or two quick references to the name that should be given to the parks proposed by the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also had a copy of the letter from Mr. Marshall from West Linton. I am not sure what is worrying him about the existing public access in the Pent-lands. I have been in the Pentlands from time to time and have seen the red flag flying there, but I understand that it has more to do with a firing range than a people's republic having been set up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
there by my good friends on Lothian regional council. That will come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have received the draft amendments which were kindly circulated to the sponsors of the Bill by the Scottish Landowners' Federation. In these amendments, as the hon. Member for South Angus has already said, the federation shies away from the description of these parks as parks and suggests that they should be referred to as management areas. I have studied the submission carefully, but I agree with the line taken by the hon. Member for South Angus. We may as well call a spade a spade and, for that matter, a park a park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Scottish Landowners' Federation, Mr. Marshall from West Linton or anybody else likes it or not, we are setting up parks in the generally accepted meaning of the word in the rural setting. No doubt there are urban parks and there are rural parks. Here we are clearly talking about rural parks, where there should be greater access and facilities for the public. That is what the hon. Member for South Angus is trying to set up, and I think that he is right to stick to his guns on the description of parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the amendments under discussion. Amendment No. 17 seeks to leave out the words " and extensive in size ". I accept the hon. Member's explanation and am happy to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 seeks to leave out the words "a substantial number of" before "the inhabitants ". I should like to press the hon. Member further on that matter, because I think that the drafting of this part of the clause is unsatisfactory. Even if the hon. Gentleman cannot accept my amendment at this stage, will he look at the subsection with a view to redrafting it and tabling an amendment on Report, not only to tidy the " substantial number " point but to take account of the interests of inhabitants outside the area where the park is to be set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his acceptance of the terminology "extensive in size". I realise that it might be desirable to have another look at the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"a substantial number of the inhabitants of the area ".</p></blockquote>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I should be grateful if he would consider withdrawing his amendment. I shall look at the matter again to see whether the clause can be improved upon on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point of substance between us; it is simply a matter of tidying the definition. If that is all that is required, I shall look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 3, line 19, after "unit", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>' along with the relevant district councils'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 20, in page 3, line 24, after " Councils ", insert " or relevant District Councils ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to determine whether district councils should be included in the management and running of regional parks, either as well as regional councils or, perhaps, instead of regional councils. I think that this debate will be relevant and should be replied to properly by the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has been particularly drawn to the existing Loch Lomond park which is adroitly managed by both the Strathclyde regional council and the Central regional council. There is also an imput from Stirling district council and Dunbarton district council. Under the provisions before us, one wonders whether those two district councils, which are planning authorities and which have a legitimate interest in countryside and recreational matters, are to be excluded from the management of the regional parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth referring to the recommendations of the Stodart committee which reported recently on its inquiry into local government in Scotland and the distribution of responsibilities between the two tiers of local authorities. The committee's recommendation No. 129 on parks says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The powers conferred on local authorities by the Public Parks (Scotland) Act 1878 to provide among other things, parks, public walks or pleasure grounds, are exercised by regional, islands and district councils. In keeping with our general philosophy on leisure and recreation we recommend that only district (and islands) councils should have these powers."</p></blockquote>
That recommendation is clear enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recommendation No. 138, under the section headed " Countryside ", says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Representations on the allocation of responsibility for countryside functions have varied from arguments for the outright transfer of control, either to regions or districts, to submissions in favour of concurrency continuing, subject to working agreements between the tiers on the division of responsibilities. For our part we see the range of countryside functions at present exercised by local authorities as being essentially related to amenity, and this leads us to recommend that these should form part of district councils' comprehensive responsibility for leisure and recreation."</p></blockquote>
The Report continues in that vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are clear recommendations made by the Stodart committee, which reported in January of this year. It appears that the hon. Gentleman is here moving in exactly the opposite direction. He is taking power and authority from district councils and putting it exclusively in the hands of regional councils or groups of regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will he explain his intentions so that the Committee can give this point proper consideration at this stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this amendment I propose to be brief. I think that the hon. Gentleman was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
right to draw attention to	<div class='sup'>!</div> <!-- sup --> the Stodart committee report, but the recommendations of that committee are of wider import in local administration in Scotland. As I understand it, my hen. Friend the Under-Secretary, the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), and his ministerial colleagues have not yet reached a firm conclusion on those recommendations. Therefore, that is properly a matter for me to leave to my hon. Friend to comment upon to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to me a regional authority seems the appropriate body to look after a regional park. Regional parks are to be " extensive in size " and it would be administratively most convenient if each could be operated by a single authority. That does not mean that in an individual case the district council should not be made part of a joint management team. One can envisage circumstances where the district council would necessarily be involved, such as a country park on the Clyde-Muirshiel model which might fall within the regional park but already be in the ownership and control of the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, where the Secretary of State desires, he can under clause 5(4) by regulations prescribe the procedure for making orders under subsection 	<i>(2)(a)</i>— the designation of lands—and so, in the particular case and in general, he could make provision for the discussion and negotiation with district councils where necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises two issues: first, whether one authority or two should have the power to set up regional parks, that is, whether both regional and district councils should have the power; secondly, if not both, which is the more appropriate authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must agree that it is sensible to avoid the confusion which might arise by leaving the designation of a regional park to the initiative of either the regional or the district council. There is no logical basis for such a dual responsibility. Since the reorganisation of local government, the movement of public opinion has been towards the designation of one or other tier as the responsible body for particular areas of policy making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question is whether the responsibility should be that of the regional or the district council. My- hon. Friend the Member for South Augus (Mr. Fraser) correctly pointed out that a regional park by its very nature will be an extensive area, possibly covering a significant part of Scotland. It would therefore be more sensible to consider it as the responsibility of the regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) drew the Committee's attention to the recommendations of the Stodart committee. The Government are awaiting representations on the Stodart committee's recommendations on this issue and en all the others raised by the committee. We have not yet had an opportunity to consider the views of the convention or of other bodies that wish to put their views on those recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
I invite the Committee to accept the clause in its present form at this stage, but I assure the hon. Gentleman mat from the Government's point of view that need not end the matter. If, at the end of the day, Stodart's recommendations are accepted, there will be a need for legislative means to implement those recommendations thought appropriate. That will be an opportunity to reconsider this matter in the light of the general response to Stodart. At this stage, it is sensible that we show clearly that it is appropriate that one tier of local government is appropriate for designating regional parks. I should have thought that there is at least a prima facie argument that when we are dealing with something extensive in size and liable to cover a substantial area, regional councils have a good claim for that area of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that that is not a firm view. We shall be happy to look at the representations that are received about the Stodart report. Indeed, if the bulk of evidence indicates that district councils would be more appropriate, that can be considered by the Government and by the House when the general recommendations of Stodart are being examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was told yesterday that widespread, authoritative rumours were circulating among those interested in country parks and such places in Scotland that, as a result of the Stodart committee recommendations, an imminent transfer of responsibilities was likely from regional councils to district councils. I think that the Minister has just put the lid on that speculation. If that is so, it is interesting and surprising, in view of the clear recommendation made for good reasons by the Stodart committee.

It occurs to me that district councils have responsibilities for such matters as planning, housing, and environmental health, all of which are relevant to the management of and considerations relating to regional parks or other areas of public access. Regional council responsibilities are on a different plane and involve such matters as education, social work and transport. I am surprised that the hon. Member for South Angus and the Minister are being intransigent and, I think, a little unhelpful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has described us in those terms. Unhelpful is the last thing I wish to appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am really saying is that we have not come to a firm conclusion on this matter: we are awaiting representations from the interested bodies. If the hon. Gentleman is correct that all the interested bodies firmly believe that it should be the district councils, no doubt these are should be the district councils, no doubt these are the representations that we shall receive, and we shall be able to consider that matter at some leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we decide at this stage will not pre-empt the final outcome because, inevitably, if any Stodart recommendations on any matter are accepted by the Government, legislative change will be necessary which will give an early opportunity to consider the

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
matter. It would be wrong for the Government at this stage, even before we have seen any representations and been able to consider the implications of any proposals in this regard and on other matters, to jump the gun on this issue. No urgency is involved. No one will lose out as a result of a decision that we may take today on this matter. We wish to have time to consider what the hon. Gentleman says are the likely representations. That is why it seems sensible to move in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to give any definitive statement on the representations to be made to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon.

But it would be helpful to have that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have indicated, I am not very happy about the clause as drafted at present as it appears to exclude district councils. It would be ludicrous for me to talk about pressing this matter to a vote at this stage, since at the last count I was outnumbered by eight to one. However, it might be helpful if all concerned could give this matter further consideration, and perhaps we can return to this issue on Report. Therfore, I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 40, after "order", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>" Community Councils for areas affected by the order ".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has heard me in the past talking about community councils, and I should perhaps give him fair warning that he is about to hear from me again on the subject. I am worried about the status of community councils in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 51 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1978 sets up community councils as statutorily and democratically elected bodies with the right to be heard and consulted. However, it has become abundantly clear over the years that, after setting up those councils, few people are taking the trouble to pay much attention to representations made by these councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I intend to take every opportunity to try to lay a duty on any public body to consult a community council before action is taken by that body which will affect the council's area. Subsection (4)	<i>(a)</i> proposes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"owners, lessees and occupiers of land within the area designated in the order "</p></blockquote>
shall be notified. Not only should the owners, lessees and occupiers and everybody else be notified,
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
but community councils in the relevant areas should also be notified about the proposals, and they should have the opportunity to make observations and representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5(4) states that the Secretary of State is empowered by regulations to
	<br><blockquote><p>" prescribe the procedure for making orders under subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>)".</p></blockquote>
When regional parks are established, clearly some people who may be affected will require to be consulted. I cannot compel the Secretary of State to make any specific regulation, but it seems that that is the stage at which it would be appropriate to consider whether community councils should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be slightly extraordinary to include community councils responsible for the areas affected by the order when district councils—which have a primary responsibility in this matter—are not included in the statute as being required to be consulted. Clearly, one would hope that district councils are to be consulted in terms of the regulations and possibly community councils and certainly those people who are directly affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present in Scotland, a regional authority could set up a regional park and so describe it without any statutory base and without consultations. I believe that clause 4 will have a value for people such as Mr. Marshall from the Pentland Hills, who might be concerned about such an order being made. They will now have the opportunity to present their views and be consulted in a fashion in which they are not statutorily obliged to be at present. That is a valuable advantage, and I hope that, within any area, a community council would be consulted. Therefore, it is inappropriate to make a specific provision for such people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that I certainly do not exclude the possibility that community councils may be included. The hon. Member will see that the regulations may specify persons other than those referred to in subsection 	<i>4(a)</i> to whom these details will be sent. My right hon. Friend intends to consult interested bodies before the regulations are drafted. We shall consider at that time whether community councils should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend is correct in saying, in terms of what appears on the statute, that the right to notification should at this stage be to persons who are either the owners, lessees or occupiers of the land. They would have the most immediate interest and might be affected directly by any such designation. Therefore, they should have a guaranteed statutory right. We shall certainly consider whether not only community councils but a number of other bodies which might have an interest in any such designation should also be taken into account when the regulations are being framed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's assurance is helpful as far as it goes, and I suppose that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
should be thankful for small mercies after yesterday's Budget. The rebuttal given by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) seems to be a " Catch-22 " which will always be used against consultations or taking account of the views from community councils—namely, that they cannot be taken account of if there is no specific reference to district councils, regional councils, the Scottish Office or probably the United Nations as well. Either the community councils have the right to be consulted or they have not, and it seems clear that section 51 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act which set them up is really so much whitewash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is most demoralising for those Scottish citizens who are prepared to give up their time and make considerable sacrifices to serve on community councils when to be heard by deaf ears seems to be their only right. I have said that before, and I give the Minister fair warning that I shall continue pegging away at the issue and shall probably bore him to death over future months and years. However, in view of the slight concession which he seemed to be making, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 4, line 15, leave out subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment, because several of us would like to know what the powers covering regional parks will be. Subsection (6) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a planning application is made in relation to lands which fall within an area designated as a regional park, the planning authority shall have regard to the fact that the area has been so designated in considering the application."</p></blockquote>
Presumably, planning authorities already take account of the fact that an area is an area of natural beauty or is a rural or countryside area. If that is the only power to be granted concerning future plans and developments of the regional parks, one wonders whether it is worth setting this up. What material changes in planning will be achieved under the clause? If subsection (6) represents the only power, what is the point of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention of the subsection is twofold. First, as we have already considered, there are owners, occupiers and lessees of land within a regional park who have a legitimate interest in the establishment and designation of regional parks, and we consider it appropriate that they should be notified of that. In line with that general intention, they should also, through the statutory inclusion of this form, be told that their interests in the land may—I stress the word " may "—be affected by regional park designation. However, I strongly emphasise that the clause places no prohibition on development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the hon. Gentleman a simple example of what I mean. The Inverkip marina is situated in the Clyde-Muirshiel regional park. That extensive development—I believe that it is continuing—was positively encouraged by the management of the regional park as an appropriate type of development within a regional park. The clause is not a pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
hibition and is nothing to do with a green belt restriction on development of any sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that it is envisaged that, because one of the major land uses of a regional park will be recreation, the planning authority should have regard to that in its planning policy within the areas. There is no presumption to be read into this against non-recreational development. A great many developments will either be appropriate to or consistent with the purpose served by the regional park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that a regional authority, having made this designation, ought to have regard to that in any planning decisions that it takes, either in looking to its structure plan or in dealing with an individual application for a development. But it is nevertheless appropriate to have a reference to planning in the clause. It is only a matter of " having regard", and nothing further than that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is nothing particularly sinister about it. Those landowners who would be within the designated area ought not to be anxious that any development that they might consider would necessarily be restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always assume that anything in the name of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) must be sinister—(HON. MEMBERS: " Oh."]—but, in view of that helpful explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 4, line 15, after ' lands ', insert ' and heritages'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection referred to reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a planning application is made in relation to lands which fall within an area designated as a regional park, the planning authority shall have regard to the fact that the area has been so designated in considering the application."</p></blockquote>
I am trying to understand what kind of planning application would be made in relation to lands. My intention is to insert the words " and heritages " so that the provision covers buildings as well as what takes place on the land. It may be that buildings are included in the term " land ", and I see the hon. Member for South Angus indicating assent. In that case, there is no need to go further with the amendment. It would be absurd if local authorities were prevented from taking account of the fact that an area had been designated as a regional park when determining planning applications for building or other developments. That is my fear, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman may be able to allay it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that his anxieties are ill-founded. The terms that he wishes to use, of " lands and heritages ", is a term of art and statute used only in connection with rating and valuation legislation where the way of valuing land and heritage for rateable purposes may be different. But, in planning law, the essential concept is always that of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
development of land. That, I assure the hon. Member, necessarily includes any buildings, factories, or any such thing that is put on to that land. " Lands " as defined in subsection (6) will include any building and—although the point may not have occurred to the hon. Gentleman—in this circumstancve, water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that fascinating piece of elucidation.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will appreciate this single-handed opposition by a sponsor of the Bill is causing me some difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the clause refers to duties in respect of rights of way and footpaths; I hope that this is correct. Precious little has been done over the years by local authorities or any other bodies to preserve footpaths or increase their mileage, or to register rights of way. I wonder what progress has been made in this important area, and whether the hon. Gentleman envisages that the powers he is seeking in the Bill will improve the position on the provision of footpaths and the registration and protection of rights of way. I wonder also whether the Minister can tell us whether any money will be made available to anybody for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The twelfth report of the Countryside Commission for Scotland for the year 1979 says something about footpath agreements, long-distance routes, access agreements, and so on. On footpath agreements, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the year Strathclyde and Central Regional Councils became involved in negotiating a joint ten-mile long footpath agreement associated with the West Highland Way."</p></blockquote>
That is hardly a spectacular achievement. One wonders whether the hon. Gentleman envisages that it might be made possible to take rather more dramatic and constructive steps to protect and develop the network of rights of way and footpaths in Scotland, in particular in the regional parks he is seeking to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks, however, are addressed primarily to the Minister. As ever, I am anxious to see an improvement in the provision of public facilities, but that can only be achieved if more funds are made available. Do the Government intend to increase expenditure at all in this field?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the purpose of the clause is simply to rectify a consequence of the reorganisation of local government. Because, under the 1967
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Act all local authorities are involved in these matters, it seems sensible to confine the responsibility of local authorities carrying out these functions under section 46 of the 1967 Act to the planning authorities, which means, throughout most of Scotland, the district councils. That is what the clause provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the hon. Gentleman's general question. The Government give considerable support to these matters both through the grant given to the Countryside Commission and through the help given to local authorities. How the rate support grant is used is, of course, a matter for local authorities. No specific grant is made to the local authorities to cover countryside matters, and it is the discretion of the local authority that is the relevant consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, because of the overall economic situation the Countryside Commission for Scotland, like other public bodies, has had to accept some economies in the support the Government can provide, it has by no means been unfairly treated in that respect. It still commands a very high proportion of the resources that used to be available to it. I have no doubt, therefore, that further progress can be made in these areas, and that a lack of resources is not a significant problem affecting the development of rights of way, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters ultimately must be determined locally by local authorities and the Countryside Commission for Scotland, but I think the hon. Gentleman can rest assured that nothing that has been suggested to me indicates that resources are a significant factor in any delay or timidity in developing amenities of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears from my reading of the clause that the hon. Member is seeking to enable local authorities to make byelaws in respect of public foothpaths, accesses and rights of way. I should like an explanation of how the byelaws can possibly be enforced. I can understand how a byelaw which may be imposed in respect of the conduct of members of the public on footpaths in a urban area may well be enforceable, because there are policemen in urban areas, but how is a local authority to enforce a byelaw if somebody vandalises a stile in the middle of Rannoch Moor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has shown a commendable interest in the development of long-distance routes in Scotland. It is an extremely desirable development, and he makes a good point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
on the enforcement of byelaws on these long-distance routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mode of enforcement will be through the ranger system. Under the 1967 Act, they are called wardens. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that schedule 1(4)(	<i>a</i>) and 	<i>(b)</i> redesignates those referred to as wardens in section 65 of the 1967 Act as rangers. They will do what they can to ensure that the byelaws are observed. That is the simple answer. The hon. Gentleman quoted the example of Rannoch Moor. Of course, we do not envisage that there will be a great army of rangers all over Scotland, but enforcement will be through the ranger system which has already been set up under another name under the 1967 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it reasonable to expect rangers to provide any realistic cover on longdistance routes? The longest existing long-distance route crosses my constituency and ends in the constituency of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). It is 204 miles from Port Patrick to Cock-burnspath. I do not know whether at this moment there are rangers plodding the length of that path and checking whether any styles or footbridges have been vandalised. I doubt whether the provisions that the hon. Member has in mind will be realistic or enforceable, but I commend his optimism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EXTENSION OF DEFINITION OF " OPEN COUNTRY "</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another nit-picking point to raise here. I shall be intrigued to know whether the hon. Member—or indeed the Government—by means of clause 8 propose to extend the statutory definition of " foreshore " to include adjacent land—whatever that might mean. It could be a field, a wood, or almost anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the Government's intention to extend the definition of "foreshore"—and it looks like it in this provision—this could have far-reaching and intriguing repercussions on sporting rights. I live on a tidal stretch of the river Tweed, and I am constantly reminded that there is no control over sporting on Scotland's foreshores. Anyone can shoot what he likes as long as he is on the foreshore. A tidal stretch of a river is defined as a " foreshore ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of this provision, there could be the intriguing development of people being able to shoot willy-nilly whoever they like or anything that moves on land adjacent to a foreshore. I find that an intriguing suggestion, but I should like to confirm that that is the hon. Member's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may provide a short explanation and give an indication of what the
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
clause is all about. The starting point is section 10 of the 1967 Act, which allows for agreements or orders to be made to provide for public access to open country. In that statute, " open country " is defined as any land that consists
	<br><blockquote><p>wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor, heath, hill, woodland, cliff or foreshore, with the waterways therein or contiguous or adjacent thereto (including any bank, barrier, dune, beach, flat or other land adjacent to the waterway or foreshore).</p></blockquote>
In spite of that extensive definition, the present wording appears to require an access agreement to relate not only to waterways but also to the adjacent or contiguous land, and difficulty has arisen in trying to achieve access over water alone. For example, where public access is already available over the adjacent land, riparian owners have been found to be reluctant to enter into what they see as another unnecessary access agreement for the same land, with the end result that access over the water cannot be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause removes that difficulty by redefining " open country " so as to allow water, including the foreshore around it, to be dealt with independently of any adjacent or contiguous land. That may seem a somewhat abstract and legalistic change that is being introduced into the law, but in the case of Loch Tay—a part of Scotland to which I have already referred in relation to other byelaws- that problem was confronted. It is hoped that the change in definition introduced in the Bill will make it possible for such access agreements to be made in relation to the water alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that the definition in clause 8 applies only to this part of the Bill and is not a wider definition that would have any impact elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I know that it is not proper to debate the provisions of that Bill in this Committee, but I hope that I may make a brief reference to it in relation to clause 9 of the excellent Bill before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, clause 45 and schedule 13 of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill propose to relax all the Secretary of State's controls in England and Wales over the creation, stopping up or diversion

of public paths, whereas clause 9 of this Bill proposes the removal of such controls only where proposals are unopposed. The proposal that in Scotland only unopposed path orders should be exempted from the Secretary of State's control has, I gather, met with widespread approval. Certainly it has mine.

	<div class='title'>MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the terminology used on the drafting of clause 10. Clause 10(1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" A planning authority or the Commission may enter into agreements … with any person having an interest in land to do, or to secure the doing of, whatever in the opinion of the parties to the agreement may be necessary to preserve or enhance the natural beauty of the countryside",</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued by the "doing" and "doing of". First, how wide does the hon. Gentleman intend this definition to go? Does it simply cover tidying operations, such as cutting hedges or planting trees and so on. or does it go much further and include the filling in of quarries? Could it be interpreted even more liberally to include agreements for the stocking of rivers with fish?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, can the Minister tell us if any money will be available to implement this provision? Management agreements and good intentions can be drafted brilliantly and freely but, if there is no wherewithal with which to fund the tidying operation and the " doing " and " doing of ", we shall not make much progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the range of activities coming under the " doing " is very wide. I do not wish to speculate on all of these, but it might be helpful to give three brief examples of what I envisage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the owner of land in an area of great scenic beauty wants to change the use of that land from open grazing to woodland, that might be a rational
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
and acceptable idea for his own purposes but in the course of time it could lead to the loss of a view down a glen or across a loch. In those circumstances, the Countryside Commission or the planning authority might say to him " If you restrict your planting of trees we will recompense you, either for the way in which you are having to plant less economically, or for not planting at all."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, there might be derelict scrub woodland where regeneration would generally enhance the appearance of the countryside. All that might be required is to enclose the land round the derelict wood to reduce grazing pressure, so allowing the wood to become re-established, with the owner being given a grant for the fencing costs and an annual payment to allow those woods to start growing again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third example, which might be of some interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), is that of an area where dry-stane dykes are an important feature of the landscape, and where nowadays an owner faced with dykes falling down might prefer to replace them with post and wire fences. The countryside, particularly in the beautiful part of Scotland that my hon. Friend represents, is traditionally enhanced by stane dykes. In such circumstances, the owner might be encouraged to restore the dykes with a capital grant and thereafter see to their upkeep with a modest annual management agreement payment, thus retaining a countryside feature of considerable interest.

The opportunities within the operation of the clause are limitless, but I hope that these three short examples will help the hon.

The question that I must raise here is why the hon. Member thinks that the first part of the clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
is any better than section 7 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967, which is in broadly the same terms except that the hon. Member's clause seems to exclude the discretion, consideration or authority of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The purpose of the amendment is to provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the expenditure that is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is that we are giving wide authority to a quango—the Countryside Commission. There are serried ranks of hon. Members in front of me who spend a great deal of time being uncomplimentary about quangos. Yet here we are apparently giving much wider discretion to a nominated body on the way that it should spend its money. I wonder whether it would be worth while leaving some supervisory powers with the Secretary of State, or at least to make it possible for parliamentary scrutiny to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be relevant at this point to make another brief reference to the twelfth report of the Countryside Commission for Scotland, which lists in appendix D the grants that it made in 1979. A number of worthwhile grants were made. For example, one was made towards the landscaping of village hall grounds, to a community council. A curious grant of £461 was made to Mr. J. P. Grant of Rothiemurchus estate for the provision of photographic equipment. Perhaps there should have been some explanation of that grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is followed by a substantial grant, of £100,000, to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association for the provision of a youth hostel at Pitlochry. A grant of £13 was made to Dornoch community council for a proposed signpost to Meikle Ferry. Two of my constituents have been beneficiaries. Lieutenant-Colonel Furness of Netherbyres, Eyemouth, received £285 for amenity tree planting—I do not know whether that was for his own amenity, or for the amenity of the people of Eyemouth— to provide trees or a shelter belt between his house and the borough, but I have no doubt that the project was worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of my constituents, Mr. A. Palmer of Manderston House, Duns—also of Huntley and Palmers biscuits—received £244 towards rebuilding a stone triangle in his drive. The final example that I intend to cite—the Committee will be relieved to hear—is of another intriguing applicant who received £300 for felling diseased elms and replanting adjacent to a public footpath. She is Countess Isabelle Solms, of Weldam, Goor, Holland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of a wide range of grant-aided projects and quite a lot of money. The total sum of grants offered during 1979 was £218,835—of which, incidentally, £100,000 went on the youth hostel to which I referred earlier. We are talking of widely different types of applicant, and I suggest that there is a strong argument for some kind of scrutiny or supervisory authority over the Countryside Commission for Scotland which, as I have said earlier, is no more and no less than a quango.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ritkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Countryside Commission for Scotland has exercised the autonomy de facto since 1979 which the provision would enable it to> exercise de jure. For the past two years, the Commission has technically been the agent of the Secretary of State, but has in practice been the responsible body for the payment of sums of that kind. If the clause is approved, its authority to make grants will be exactly the same as that of the Countryside Commission elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It seems to be sensible that if such a body exists, it should have discretionary power to make payments of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman can be absolutely assured that there is proper accountability and responsibility, first, that any sums paid by the Countryside Commission for Scotland are paid in accordance with instructions laid down by the Secretary of State and approved by the Treasury about the general criteria that should be applied for the payment of grant; secondly, the accounts of the commission are open to parliamentary scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee. Therefore, there is an ultimate control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general terms, the clause regularises what has in effect been happening for about the last two years. It has not given rise to any public criticism over that period; nor have identical powers elsewhere in the United Kingdom aroused criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that where a public body is providing a grant, we should be assured that it is acting responsibly. It is for this reason that the Countryside Commission, like other public bodies dispensing grant, must conform to criteria laid down by the Secretary of State, which can be changed at any time if there is the slightest indication that the public interest is not being properly served. Thus, the clause regularises the procedure that has been applied since April 1979 and not given rise to public criticism. Indeed I suspect that most recipients of grant over that period thought that the commission could make the payments directly, although they had to be confirmed by the Secretary of State before being paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured by that explanation. I can confirm that the Government are as anxious as he is to ensure that there is proper accountability for the way in which the commission operates. We do not believe that that accountability will be in any way inhibited or endangered by a provision of the kind referred to in the clause. On that basis, I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's assurance is helpful. I want simply to reiterate that I think that it is important that any public expenditure should be subject to proper accountability, either in this House or elsewhere.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This again is a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subparagraph, which my hon. Friends and I thought it might be interesting to exclude, refers to compensation paid to members of the commission if they give up office for any reason during the period of their appointment. It might be helpful if the Minister explained under what circumstances he envisages members of the commission being dismissed or whatever it might be and also under which circumstances he would feel it appropriate to pay them compensation. In passing, it might be interesting if he gave an explanation of the remuneration received by members of the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is right that members of the staff and employees of the commission should have this kind of protection, but I should appreciate a brief explanation from the Minister of the standing of the members of the commission in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this clause and the amendment relate to Government expenditure and arrangements made for payments to Government appointees, it appears to me that the subject is more appropriately left to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept that awesome responsibility so gratuitously put in my direction by my hon. Friend. Perhaps I may explain the clause. It is a technical matter, but the hon. Gentleman is right to seek an explanation of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public bodies such as the Countryside Commission normally follow the practice used in the main public services. A difficulty has been recognised in that although provision is made for the payment of pensions and gratuities in the statute setting up the commission, there is no specific reference to compensation as such which would have the effect of preventing them from following the provisions of previous legislation in the sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to resolve the present situation regarding the Countryside Commission whereby members of various public bodies have no legal right to compensation whatever the circumstances of the termination of their appointment. The provision is not introduced to meet any specific case within the commission either known or anticipated. The problem is not peculiar to the commission. Similar omissions exist in legislation dealing with other public bodies and, therefore, with the agreement of those concerned, we are taking this opportunity to rectify the omission. It is right that there should be no statutory prohibition on members of the commission—or its officials—if membership is terminated for reasons which would normally, elsewhere in the public service, justify an element of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberstou</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no example in the Countryside Commission at present, nor do we anticipate one. However, a person's membership could, for example, be terminated through no fault of his own, but for reasons which would normally justify some form of compensation or redundancy payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for details of the sums involved. The chairman receives £7,695 per annum which is based on three days' work a week which would be equivalent to a salary of £12,800 if there were a full working week. The vice-chairman receives £3,024 for a full-time equivalent of one and a half days a week. Only paid members of the commission would be eligible for compensation under the provision, and those are the only paid members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Secretary of State powers to dismiss members of the commission and would the compensation provisions come into effect in that case? We are talking about something purely hypothetical, but I think that it is worth debating it properly at this stage. One's imagination can run riot on such issues and one wonders whether, on the election of the next Labour Government, it would be possible for Mr. George Galloway to be appointed chairman of the Countryside Commission and for the present chairman to be sacked and receive compensation under this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested that the hon. Gentleman seems to view that situation with the same horror as my hon. Friends. The problem is that under existing law a pension or gratuity can be paid only on retirement or death and not on termination of office for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what powers the Secretary of State has. Under the provisions of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 he has the power to remove a person from membership for a series of reasons which are contained in schedule 1(3). There is scope for removal from office if those criteria are satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy about the provision if it were merely to stop making it impossible for the Secretary of State to approve some form, of compensation, but I would be concerned if the converse were true and that persons appointed to such boards ware automatically entitled to redundancy payments. That would worry me because I think that there is a major distinction between officials and persons appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, and no such guarantee is provided. I shall give an example of when such a provision might apply. One of the grounds on which the Secretary of State can remove a member is incapacitation by physical or mental illness. In those circumstances it is possible that some form of gratuity might be thought appropriate. I am not saying that that is what would happen, but it is certainly an example of why membership might be terminated at an earlier date through no fault of the person concerned. At the moment, it would not be possible for that to lead to the payment of any form of gratuity. It is simply to put the commission in the same position as any other public body that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intention is to' uprate various fines and penalties existing under the 1967 Act. In view of the absolute certainty of continuing inflation, in spite of—or, indeed, because of—yesterday's Stone Age Budget, the hon. Gentleman might like to consider the possibility of index-linking the fines. That would save parliamentary time in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggestion may be considered flippant, but a great deal of parliamentary time is currently taken up in uprating the fines, for instance, that courts can impose, and many other payments have been index-linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, the fines that are being uprated were fixed in 1967. For nine of the past 13 years the hon. Gentleman's party has been in Government, and that may be why these changes are needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but, sadly, the hon. Gentleman is a member of the present Government, under which inflation is continuing apace and is likely to continue to do> so. We would be doing ourselves a favour by index-linking the fines rather than tinkering with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a mistake in saying that inflation is continuing apace. At the moment—as he must realise, being an honest Member of Parliament—it is going down. I wonder whether it is his idea, in making this suggestion, that if inflation continues to drop at the present rate, the fines should be index-linked downwards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a cheerful thought, but anyone who thinks that inflation is coming down in the countryside areas of Scotland or of the rest of the country is making a serious mistake. One must take into account the savage increase in the cost of petrol that the Chancellor announced yesterday. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to consider this serious idea that the fines should, in future years, be index-linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the hon. Gentleman's ingenuity in bringing El Salvador into last week's debate, I suppose that it was to be anticipated that in one way or another he would work a reference to petrol in rural areas into this morning's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
The increase in the maximum fines is clearly necessary, although some of the sections under which the fines to be increased arise seem rather obscure. One of them relates to the permitting of a bull to be at large in a public right of way. In view of the difficulties that that proposal is causing in another place, I respectfully suggest to the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to question why the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is seeking to repeal section 9 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967, which refers to areas of special planning control. He may be about to give the answer that he has already given, namely, that it is being replaced by the planning provisions that he has included in respect of the proposed regional parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know to what extent powers under section 9 have been used in the past. It might be helpful if we could have a brief explanation of the reason why the hon. Member is seeking to repeal section 9, which gave wide-ranging powers to planning authorities to control activities in designated areas of special planning control. I am short of information on the subject, and it might be helpful to have clarification of the number of areas of special planning control, how large they are, and generally the extent to which the section has been enforced and its effect, It may be worth leaving the provision on the statute book, unless we can all be satisfied that it has been replaced satisfactorily and suitably by the provisions of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 9 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 gave power to the Secretary of State for Scotland to designate as an area of special planning control an area in the countryside of particular beauty, amenity or other special characteristic. A simpler form of control has now been introduced by a direction dated 19 August 1980 which has established areas of natural scenic beauty, or national scenic areas, and requires a reference to the Secretary of State only where the planning authority and the Countryside Commission are unable to agree on the approval of planning application in one of those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among other forms of control which that procedure replaced, section 9 of the 1967 Act was to be repealed by the Secretary of State. This is obviously a repeal on which it would be appropriate to hear from the Minister. But it has always seemed to me that the power contained in section 9 was far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
too wide. It is far too restrictive in the control that it imposes on the countryside in Scotland, and I am anxious that it should be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, a direction under section 9 has only once been made, and that was in respect of the Pentland Hills. It is astonishing to read the observations made in the letter sent to us by Mr. Marshall, a farmer in the Pentlands, because he seemed to be anxious that a regional park would give a planning anthority greater power over developments in that area. In fact, at the time, there was a direction under section 9 over the land he owned which was far more stringent in its control development than anything that we have considered in clause 5. I am very anxious to see the end of this provision, and I am sure that its passing will not be regretted by anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct that the repeal of section 9 under this schedule is not strictly related to the other provisions of the Bill. It arises not out of the establishment of regional parks but as a consequence of the establishment of national scenic areas under the direction issued in August last year. At that time, my right hon. Friend indicated that a consequence of the new system applying to national scenic areas would be the repeal of section 9 which, as my hon. Friend suggested, as in certain respects more stringent. It was thought to be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pentland Hills area is the only one to which section 9 was applied and, since the new designation of national scenic areas has been introduced, it was appropriate that my right hon. Friend's commitment to the repeal of section 9 should also be met. I am delighted to see that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is probably better qualified than most to reply to my question as he is not only the Minister with responsibility for local authorities but also the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands. What controls which have applied up to now in the Pentlands area under section 9 of the 1976 Act will now be relaxed? Is the repeal to be retrospective? If someone has had a planning application turned down in the Pentlands area on the basis of section 9 will he now be able to have that planning decision reversed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As of August last year, as a result of the directive issued at that time, the Pentland Hills, as an area designated under section 9, was de-designated. Since last August there have been no parts of Scotland to which section 9 controls apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pentland Hills area comes under the new national scenic area categorisation. That system requires a reference to the Secretary of State, either where the Countryside Commission has not been
