<p><i>Amendment moved [15 January]</i> No. 7, in line 45, leave out from "between" to "the" in line 46.</p>
<p><i>[Mr. Dewar.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we ended our previous sitting I had started to discuss amendment No. 7, which draws attention to the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole".</p></blockquote>
That relates to the preservation of the ratio between the classes of property which might be valued or revalued under a specification made under clause 2 by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I have given some thought to .the matter over the past day or two, and I am now even more doubtful about the phraseology and its implications. I say that with proper modesty because, although in my wilder moments I occasionally think that I am literate, I am conscious that by no standards am I numerate. The understanding of ratios and the .interrelationships between mathematical formulas is not one of my stronger attributes. We may be arguing about methodology and about a point that does not exist. I shall try to explain what I mean by that, and when I have done so perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to put my mind finally at rest, so that we shall not need to spend a great deal of time on the issue.<br><br>
To help the process of my understanding I thought it might be best to use a very simple model—the model would have to be simple if constructed by me. We might presuppose that there were only three classes of property which could be the subject of valuation under clause 2. Let us assume that they are A, B and C. In Scotland the ratio in the existing valuation roll—that is, before use of the powers in clause 2—is 30:50.20. If there were an order to revalue by 100 per cent, class A, the class with the rateable value which will produce 30 per cent, of the total, and if in the original roll that stood at £500 million, that figure would become £1,000 million. The distortion would have to be dealt with by the machinery set out an subsections (6A) and (6B). Leaving aside the complications of multipliers and divisors 'being used, it would be simple to apply a divisor of two, thus reducing £1,000 million to £500 million in order to maintain the ratio in that Scottish aggregate total. The advantage of doing that—I do not know whether the advantage is substantial enough to justify all the work, anxiety and puzzlement—is that even in the £500 million which would thus be maintained the proportions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
borne by individual properties would vary.<br><br>
I 'think that that is clear and simple enough in terms of the Scottish figures. Let us stick with A, B and C. Let us assume that the Scottish ratio of 30:50.20 is totally different in a region where there are perhaps specific circumstances, such as a high oil-related industrial content. Instead of their being 30:50.20, let us assume that the proportions are 40:30.30 in that region, because presumably within Scotland there will be variations. Let us assume again that class A is revalued and, instead of going up by 100 per cent., it goes up by a considerably larger factor—a factor of three.<br><br>
If the rateable value of class A in that region had been £100 million and it had gone up not, as the national figure did, by a factor of two but by a factor of three to £300 million, what would be the right divisor to apply? That is the crux of the amendment. We are trying to discover from, the Under-Secretary the answer to that question and the results that flow from his answer.<br><br>
There are two ways to approach the problem. It depends on which way the Government intend administratively to do it. We could say that that £300 million total has to be divided in such a way as to preserve the ratios. We can do it on an all-Scotland basis and then divide by two, because that is what has happened to class A on the national, aggregate figures. Or we can say that we shall do it on a regional basis and apply the divider of three, because that is what this class of property has increased by. That is the multiplier, as a result of revaluation, on that regional basis.<br><br>
At the end of the day, as a means of preserving the ratio on an all-Scottish basis, as I understand it, it would not matter which method we used, but it would have a considerable effect upon those who were paying the rateable value within that region. If we take the £300 million which is the new total rateable value for class A property within that region and divide it by two, because we are doing it on a Scottish basis, we see that clearly they will have to pay £150 million. If we divide it by three, because we are doing it piecemeal, region by region, they will pay only £100 million. That would make a distinct difference to the individual ratepayer.<br><br>
If someone has a rateable value of £600,000 within the £100 million class A total in that region, if we apply the Scottish figure the rateable value will be £300,000. But if we apply the regional divider of three, the rateable value will be £200.000. Therefore, the end from which we approach the subject becomes important, and it is not clear from the wording of the Bill.<br><br>
If we were to apply the national divider of two in the very artificial example that I have picked, it would be a considerable disadvantage to ratepayers in that category of property in that region. But there would no doubt be people in other regions—because of the offsetting so that the average would be reached—who would see it as a considerable advantage. If, instead of going up by a factor of three, revaluation had put someone up below the Scottish average of two—let us say, only by 50 per cent, rather than by 100 per cent.—to use the national divider would be a considerable advantage.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
I hope that the Under-Secretary follows the point that I am making, perhaps a little laboriously. I think that it is fairly self-evident. In a sense, it does not matter, because if one was the regional basis, and takes Grampian, Strathclyde or whatever the assessor's district is and applies the multiplier or divisor on the basis of that region, one is keeping the ratios the same in each region. At the end of the day, one will reach the same aggregate position for Scotland as a whole. It seems self-evident— perhaps the Under-Secretary will hasten to assure me of this—that that is the only fair and equitable way in which to approach the subject.<br><br>
I tabled the amendment because when I first read new subsection (6B) and read the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole"</p></blockquote>,
I assumed that we would be having an aggregate Scottish figure and ensuring that on an aggregate basis we would be maintaining the ratios. This would result in the distortion which I have suggested, and the victimisation of certain categories of ratepayers who fall into revaluation classes in particular regional areas.<br><br>
Am I right in my assumption that the revaluation will be done on a regional basis? If the appropriate divisor is applied to each region on a regional basis, the ratio for each region will be preserved, and if each part is the same, the sum of the parts must be the same. If it is to be done like that, it ought to be made clear in the Bill. To remove the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole"</p></blockquote>
would make the point clearer and not encourage others innocently to fall into the misapprehension which I originally entertained—maybe with some justification. I understood that the ratio was a Scottish ratio and that a divisor, multiplier or combination of both would be applied to the whole of Scotland, absolutely and completely across the board. If that is done, the resultant distortions and difficulties will be considerable.<br><br>
I hope that I have made that point clear. I see that the Under-Secretary is nodding in agreement. I hope that the Committee will find these highly artificial models useful in illustrating the point. I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply, on the basis of which we shall consider whether the point is of substance or, as I suspect, a matter of style. The removal at the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole"</p></blockquote>
would clear the way to a simpler understanding of what is behind this complicated machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has done us a service by tabling the amendment and giving us the opportunity to deal with his very relevant points. He has pointed out, correctly, that the clause in its present form, referring to a requirement to maintain the ratio for Scotland as a whole, could be interpreted as meaning that as long as the Scottish aggregate between, for example, domestic and non-domestic ratepayers, was maintained it would not matter if there were individual variations as a result of partial revaluation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
The hon Gentleman was correct in pointing out that if the clause were interpreted in such a way it could lead to a possible unfairness between ratepayers in particular areas. In different valuation areas within Scotland there are different ratios between different classes of ratepayer. For example, the ratio between domestic and non-domestic rateable values for Scotland as a whole is 1:1.8. However, in Dumfries and Galloway it is 1:1.5, and in Shetland, which is an extreme case because of the development at Sullom Voe, it is 1:24. If a simple Scottish aggregate were applied it could lead to considerable disadvantage for particular classes of ratepayer unless care were taken to ensure a local variation.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman was also correct in saying that the problem might be a matter of style. As I read the clause, there would be nothing to exclude the Secretary of State from choosing a method which differentiated between individual valuation areas, as long as the Scottish aggregate was maintained. But I accept that it would be preferable that instead of that being a possibility it should be declared as a clear intention of the clause.<br><br>
We are not satisfied that the hon Gentleman's amendment would achieve that purpose, because it simply removes certain words but does not indicate the objective of the application of this part of the clause. It simply declines to refer to Scotland as a whole. But I am prepared to accept the hon Gentleman's amendment in principle, and if he will allow us to consider more appropriate drafting, I undertake to introduce such an amendment at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I laboured away at the point, and was not sure whether it was of much substance. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt that it was important. Clarification was needed, and I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for offering to take the matter to avizandum to arrive at a better form of words. I agree that the amendment was a peg on which to hang the argument. I look forward to seeing something better and more comprehensive appearing on Report. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>; I beg to move amedment No 8, in page 3, line 5, after "Council", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Convention of Scottish Local Authorities."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 5, after "any", insert "other".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We on the Opposition Benches are aware that the Minister may be privy to information which we do not have at our disposal. Within some Conservative and independent local authority groups there may be moves afoot to create another local authority organisation in Scotland, but we do not think that that is the case. During the past 12 months
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
Scottish local authorities have had constitutional problems similar to those facing other political organisations, and have emerged relatively unscathed. Certainly, as a result of the local government elections last year, they, like other political organisations, are a good deal healthier than they were when some of us were discussing the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill last year.<br><br>
The assistance that we then received from COSLA was somewhat less than helpful. Nevertheless, we feel that it would be apropriate to include the name of COSLA in the Bill, because in Scotland we have a unique advantage over other parts of the United Kingdom in that our local authorities are represented by one organisation. When we are dealing with the complex area of valuation and rating it is appropriate for COSLA to be specifically mentioned.<br><br>
I am not seeking to delay matters, but rather to recognise the reality of local government in Scotland, which has one local authority organisation that, in the foreseeable future, is likely to continue. Indeed if COSLA were fortunate enough to obtain alternative premises for its regular meetings it might achieve a degree of prestige which has hitherto evaded it. In the complex area of rating and valuation it is important that everyone encourages local authorities to stick together so that they can be seen to be speaking, by and large, with one voice.<br><br>
That is important, bearing in mind that other parts of clause 2, which we have already discussed, have made it clear that there is to be consistency in the application of legislation and that the problems will be dealt with on an all-Scotland basis. Therefore, we take the view that COSLA, as the one Scottish local government organisation, should be given credit for its existence. We know that there are considerable difficulties south of the border, where various organisations of different political complexions represent, in their own ways, differing interests. In Scotland we have a degree of unity which we should like to see given the respectability—if that is the appropriate expression—of inclusion in the legislation.<br><br>
Many of my hon Friends will want to contribute to the debate, because in the past they have spoken about COSLA's activities. I think that they share my view that the amendment is not intended to embarrass the Government in any way, as some amendments may do. It is simply intended to take account of what is a political reality within the country. Therefore, we ask the Minister to co-operate on this non-controversial point and to give COSLA the standing which we regard as appropriate, by its being recognised by the law as the organisation which represents local government in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words in support of the amendments because, as my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said, it is important that COSLA should be formally written into the statute. Unless I am deficient in my information about local government in Scotland, COSLA is the only truly representative body of the local authorities. The Government, all local authorities and all statutory bodies recognise that when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
they are seeking the views of local government in Scotland the obvious place to go is to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.<br><br>
Since the reorganisation of local government, COSLA has firmly established its place in Scottish political life. One of the reasons why it has achieved that place is that it represents the district authorities, the regional councils and the islands authorities. In England and Wales there is a different set-up. That has led to differing views being expressed about local government on any occasion or on any issue, which may or may not be a good thing. The strength of COSLA lies in the fact that it can express one view representative of both tiers of local government.<br><br>
COSLA is recognised by every public authority. Indeed, one of the first things that right hon and hon Members say in the House when we are discussing any matter pertaining to Scotland and when they wish to strengthen their argument is that COSLA has expressed such and such a view, or that they have asked for COSLA's view and have obtained certain information, or that they are seeking COSLA's views. Time and again, COSLA is used to support the arguments being advanced. It is a Scottish institution, like the STUC or the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, that is respected as being representative of many people in Scotland. It has won that position in a very short time.<br><br>
It is now possible for us to put COSLA into the statute and give it formal recognition. COSLA is a very competent organisation. Whenever its views are sought, they are readily obtained. There is never any difficulty on the part of any hon Member, any Committee of the House or any other organisation in readily obtaining information from COSLA. It is properly staffed, and it is to be hoped that it will soon be properly housed.<br><br>
The time has come for us to establish COSLA formally. If we were to do that this morning by amendment No. 8, we would be doing the right thing. Therefore, I support the amendment. I am sure that all Opposition Members take that view. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. If he does, it will be a small and modest blow for good will between the Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I remind the Minister that this year the president of COSLA is Mr. Fitzgerald, who is a distinguished former Lord Provost of the City of Dundee.—[Interruption.] If the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland intends to speak from a sedentary position I cannot respond because I cannot hear what he says. If he wishes to intervene and tell me what he said about the distinguished former Lord Provost of Dundee, who happens to be a Tory, I should be interested to hear.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will agree to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), when tabling his amendment put forward a dramatic and exciting proposition that one acquires respectability by having one's name written into an Act of Parliament. I am not sure whether that principle has been applied in the past or whether those who have been in receipt of such an unusual honour have necessarily
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
interpreted it in that fashion. However, it is an interesting theory.<br><br>
I was also interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). I have full admiration for the convention's work. However, it would not be entirely correct to say that it has always ensured that its views on any subject of interest to local government in Scotland have been made known to the Government or the public. For example, we have just completed a review of local government in Scotland under Mr. Anthony Stodart to whom the convention declined to submit evidence. That was partly because it could not agree on its evidence, but no doubt there were other reasons, too.<br><br>
In response to the hon Gentleman's amendment, there is no doubt that the present wording of the clause includes the convention, but despite that it would be inappropriate to refer to the convention specifically in an Act of Parliament. That is not because I disagree with any reasons given by the hon. Gentleman, but because the convention is a non-statutory body. Even if the convention continues for many years, it is at least possible that it might decide to change its name. Yet it would be absurd if, as a result of such an internal decision to make a minor change in its title, an Act of Parliament was required to change its name in the legislation.<br><br>
I assure hon Gentlemen that there is no doubt that at present the convention is the only body which may come under the terms of the clause. It would be wrong to include reference to a non-statutory body—it will not be in the power of either the Government or of Parliament to determine the matter —which might decide to change its name.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman may be interested to know that the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 also referred to an association of local authorities in the same language as that used in clause 2. No doubt the previous Government did that for reasons similar to those I have given today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might accept that there is a risk of an organisation calling itself "The Conservative Association of Local Authorities" and a Conservative Secretary of State might find it appropriate to seek its help. If we do not specify who we are talking about that danger exists. I cited a Conservative body, but it could be another political organisation. There is a strong case for being clear that we are talking about a body that is wholly representative of local authorities. The Secretary of State may have a loophole which may prove to be most unhelpful to any Government in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. In saying that a Secretary of State could act in that fashion. However, that possibility is not excluded by amendment No. 9. That amendment gives discretion to the Secretary of State in that way. Therefore, I do not think that that is a persuasive argument. I assure the hon Gentleman that as long as the convention exists it is the body that the Secretary of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
State would consider. However, for the same reason as the previous Administration gave it would be wrong to write into an Act of Parliament the name of a non-statutory body which might change its name or its designation or make other changes which would require an Act of Parliament to alter. For common-sense reasons, I hope that the Opposition will not press their amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I first saw the amendments I felt that perhaps my hon Friends were being a little pedantic in tabling them, because I could not see that any organisation could possibly be held to represent the interests of local authorities in Scotland other than the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. But my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has a suspicious and devious mind, which is having an infectious effect on his hon Friends. Therefore, I had another look at subsection (6C). It requires the Secretary of State to consult
<br><blockquote><p>"any association of local authorities which appears to him to represent the interests of local authorities in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Once again the Minister is asking the Committee to enshrine in this legislation the discretion of the Secretary of State concerning local government in Scotland. I think that the Minister was being rather harsh when he intervened in the speech of my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). He claimed that the amendments would affect the discretion in the Bill. In fact, if they were accepted their effect would be to include the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities while leaving the Secretary of State discretion to consult any other bodies he may wish to consult. We would at least have the guarantee that COSLA, which the entire Committee surely agrees is the only body that represents Scottish local authorities, is tied into the Bill.<br><br>
As the subsection is drafted, the Minister would have the discretion not to consult COSLA if he did not want to do so. Indeed, he would have the discretion to consult any other groups or organisations which might not be representative of all local authorities in Scotland. The word "all" is not there; the wording is:
<br><blockquote><p>"to represent the interests of local authorities in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
It could be "some" local authorities in Scotland. The subsection is not satisfactorily drafted. It would be helpful if the Minister could at least give the Committee a clear undertaking that he will accept on Report not only the spirit of the amendment but the words
<br><blockquote><p>"Convention of Scottish Local Authorities."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot undertake to include the words
<br><blockquote><p>"Convention of Scottish Local Authorities."</p></blockquote>
That is an absurd undertaking to ask me to give in the circumstances. It would mean that, for example, if the Convention were, on its own initiative, to change its name to "Scottish Convention of Local Authorities", a new Act of Parliament would be required for the clause to take effect. I do not believe

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
that the hon Gentleman seriously would wish that to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is being pedantic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am being pedantic, perhaps the hon Gentleman will be good enough to explain in what way I am being pedantic. I should have thought that my point was obvious. Perhaps the hon Gentleman's hon Friends can enlighten him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister's reply, I shall make only two points. First, I am not sure whether COSLA was set up before the 1975 Act— whether it was in May or October. If it was not, it is rather unfair to blame the Labour Government for not .including it.<br><br>
Secondly, on the question of respectability and the pleasure derived from being enshrined in statute, my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) derives considerable satisfaction from an otherwise dubious piece of work—the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980—as his name is included in the provisions which it is hoped will lead to a reduction in football hooliganism, where there is a reference to the McElhone report. Though I do not think that my hon Friend is a statutory body, although he may on occasions give the appearance of so being.<br><br>
In the light of the Minister's words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 3, line 25, leave out from "shall" to end of line 27 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"have no effect until approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
This is a simple matter, which I raise merely as a point of principle. It is a matter which arises often and which I do not really understand. The Minister may be able to help me. I am never clear on what basis we decide when a provision shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament or when it shall have no effect until it is approved by resolution. It appears to be a fairly haphazard matter as to which line of approach is pursued by a Government.<br><br>
The amendment deals with the order that would be made in connection with sub-paragraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a) of the 1975 Act. I am particularly interested in sub-paragraph (i), because it is important. What is suggested here is that the order should be subject only to negative resolution and that there should not have to be a debate on the matter. It would be the quick-wittedness or preparedness of the Oppositon in trying to force a debate which would ensure a discussion, which does not seem to me to be entirely satisfactory.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will take the point that an order made under sub-paragraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a) is a matter of importance. That is the order that would specify a particular class of land for revaluation and would therefore
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
bring into effect the whole machinery of clause 2. I accept that the power in clause 1, which has to be approved by resolution of each House, is different and more sweeping, because it is a power to push revaluation off altogether and disrupt the quinquennial review. But a partial revaluation in a sense will involve a much more complicated procedure, and will be morally much the same sort of move as is envisaged in clause 1.<br><br>
Both provisions will be used only, as I understand it, to pave the way for major rating reform and to ensure that work in a revaluation is not carried out unnecessarily when legislation will render it redundant shortly after it has been completed. Therefore, both a proviso under clause 2 or an order under clause 1 are very much on all fours. I should have thought that prima facie there was a very strong case for saying that they ought to go through the same procedures in the House.<br><br>
I did not put down an amendment disputing the fact that under clause 1 the order should require positive approval and should not take effect until the House had said so. In those circumstances I argue strongly that the same machinery should apply under clause 2. Therefore, my amendment is appropriate and sensible.<br><br>
I think it reasonable that under subsection (6E)(6) an order should require approval by positive resolution of both Houses of Parliament, because it deals with repeals of Acts of Parliament. That is entirely consistent. I am sure that the Minister will follow the argument on my principal point.<br><br>
Last night we were dealing with an example of an affirmative resolution procedure over a very unimportant order, the Local Government Grants (Termination) (Scotland) Order, which, sensibly, was dealt with in only 5 or 10 minutes of the House's time. If a technicality of that kind can attract an affirmative resolution, something as fundamental as an order varying the quinquennial valuation should be dealt with in the same way.<br><br>
I hope that this suggestion will meet with the Minister's approval. For once, the amendment appears to be coherent and competent in its wording, and it should not be necessary to take it away for redrafting. I hope that the Minister will accept that if such a fundamental change is to be made by order there should automatically be a debate before it takes effect.<br><br>
Will the Minister also tell us whether there is a coherent Government approach to the guidelines applied in deciding whether a procedure is to be negative or affirmative? If there is no Government approach—this may also apply to previous Governments—will he say a word about his personal approach?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has explained the reasons behind his amendment and has asked how one determines whether the affirmative or the negative procedure should be applied. As Parliament has provided for both procedures, the decision on which procedure is appropriate for any class of orders—not any particular order—is essentially subjective.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
The Bill at present provides for the affirmative procedure for the major question of whether a revaluation should be postponed, and for the question of any repeal of existing legislation. As the hon Gentleman appreciated, these are fundamental matters.<br><br>
Clearly, in any Bill we must be careful not to impose too much strain on parliamentary time by providing an affirmative requirement when it is not necessary. It is important to ensure that those who might be concerned about, or hostile to, a proposal have the opportunity to speak and vote, and to defeat, if they have sufficient support, any proposed order put before the House.<br><br>
When Parliament was considering last year the equivalent Bill for England and Wales, the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill, a similar matter arose. It came to the view that there was no good reason why the negative procedure should not apply in matters of this kind. I should be the last person to suggest that that is sufficient reason to come to a similar decision for Scotland, but I should like to know of any obvious reasons why we should be different in this sort of detailed matter of parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
There is no hard and fast rule about such matters, which are essentially for subjective judgment. The interests of those opposed to any such order are fully protected by the negative procedure. I have enough respect for the hon Gentleman to believe that such a matter would not get past Parliament without him, or his hon Friends, noticing. The negative procedure allows Ministers to be questioned where there is any degree of concern about the basis of such an order.<br><br>
I hope that the hon Gentleman will agree that the present balance is reasonable. It is not a question of which is right and which is wrong. I hope that the hon Gentleman will accept that the proposals in the clause—comparable as they are to those in the Local Government, Planning and Land Act—are sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister's reply, but I am not entirely convinced. I do not think it appropriate to force the amendment to a vote now, but I hope that he will think about the matter before Report. I appreciate his argument, which is in a sense valid and practical, that there is no chance of such a matter going through, even with negative procedure, without a debate being forced. But the argument is double-edged. The Minister says that the matter is so important that no one will allow it to go through even under negative procedure, but such an argument can be turned on its head: a matter that important should be dignified by the affirmative procedure.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
An order might come from the Government which said "We shall not use section 1 of .the Act"—as it by then would be—"to put off the quinquennial revaluation altogether, which would attract the affirmative resolution procedure. But we shall turn
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
the corner by subtlety and merely say—a minor matter—that there shall be no revaluation of domestic property." If the Government were to use the powers under clause 2 to make such an announcement, all sorts of worthy hon Members— I use that adjective in no pejorative sense—such as the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), who has already expressed disquiet about the implications and possibilities that would flow from that action, would, as the Minister said, even if (the Opposition were so sleepy as to have missed it, be on their feet ensuring that there was a debate and that the negative procedure was put into motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right to assume that clause 2 cannot be activated unless clause 1 is used? Unless there is a postponement first, the rest does not come into play.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fascinating question which the Minister should clarify in the clause stand part debate or perhaps in another intervention. It had not occurred to me that there had to be an order under clause 1 before we could use the powers of clause 2. I assumed that they could be alternatives, that the Government could either say "We shall postpone revaluation for, effectively, eight years rather than five years" or "No, we shall have the five-year revaluation as planned, but it will apply only to certain categories, which we shall specify"— domestic, commercial or industrial. I presume that it would also be possible—I should have thought that two distinct pieces of parliamenty machinery would be needed to do this—to lay an order under, say, clause 1 that it will be eight years and presumably, in due course, to lay an order which would attract the negative procedure of the House, whereby the Government say that not only is it postponed to make the gap eight years but it will be a partial revaluation as well. I thought that one could use either clause or both, and that the two were not inter related and dependent on each other. I notice that the Minister is nodding assent. That is therefore the answer to my hon Friend's point.<br><br>
Therefore, it seems that very little can be said to differentiate between the situations in which these two propositions might be used. They are both paving the way for the possibility of domestic rating reform. They also seem to be of equal importance. Everything that was said by the Minister merely underlines my strong impression that they should be put on the same basis when the machinery of the House has either to approve or negative the statutory proposition.<br><br>
As the Minister fairly said, these are matters of subjective judgment—I was interested that he used the word "subjective"—for individual Departments. We are not in this short debate making an attack in principle upon any tenet of Conservative philosophy. In a sense, it is a politically neutral point.<br><br>
I am seized of the problems of time on the Floor of the House. I sometimes despair when I listen to some of the matters that we spend time on in the chamber, when so many things of great importance pass us by, almost literally, in the night. I certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
do not want to lumber the House of Commons with unnecessary debates, but I believe that a decision to postpone a quinquennial or other revaluation of a total class of property—or a number of classes of property—is a matter of genuine and fundamental importance which, as we have gathered from Conservative Members, has serious and interesting consequences.<br><br>
Therefore, the Minister would be well advised— I say this in no carping spirit—to think about it again and to consider whether it would not make his legislation, on this technical but quite important point, a little more consistent. It is important. As he conceded that he will not be able to get away with it anyway, he might as well be gracious and save us all these problems. I am sure that he does not wish to shelter behind the fact that the English came to a somewhat different decision in their analogous legislation, as he properly hastened to say, although he thought that it was worth mentioning. Perhaps they did come to a different decision, but it is a poor thing if that is advanced as an argument.<br><br>
I do not intend to ask my hon Friends to vote on the matter today, but I hope that the Minister will think about it. We shall think about it, too. If we get no response, or an indication of a response, we may return to the matter at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The amendment covers two matters: it seeks to provide for an affirmative resolution for an order prescribing a partial revaluation and for an order prescribing a method of adjustment to be applied to net annual values. I think that it is agreed between us that the method of adjustment would, clearly, be far more suitable for the negative procedure.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman has not commented on that aspect, but I do not think that is a major part of the case that he wishes to put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. It was remiss of me, but I do not think that I shall be criticised by Conservative Members for not delaying the Committee by looking at the possibility of an order under subsection (6A)—also covered by the amendment. I totally accept the Minister's point. The push of my argument is entirely related to the variation of the quinquennial review—the exclusion of classes of property. If the Minister is prepared to look at that, Opposition Members would be grateful and happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for his clarification. I shall certainly consider further the question of an affirmative resolution for partial revaluations. I cannot give an undertaking at this stage but I understand the hon Gentleman's reasons. I shall give consideration to the matter and let the hon Gentleman know in good time whether we feel able to accept such a partial amendment to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his conciliatory intervention and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am notsure whether I shall vote against clause 2 or whether my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar), on the Front Bench, will advise me to do so. I do not want to worry the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) in his temporary promotion of Whip. He will have a hard enough job to keep a quorum this morning.<br><br>
Although this is an important clause, worthy of having more time spent on it, I do not suggest that the Government will be defeated on it. My hon Friend for Garscadden has done a good job on amendment No. 7. The only thing that worries me is that he quite properly—though modestly—said that he was not sure whether he understood what he was arguing in favour of. I got the impression that the Minister did not understand it either. Therefore, when the Minister agreed to have another look at it I am not sure what he agreed to have another look at.<br><br>
I want to come back to that because there are some aspects of clause 2 that are still a wee bit bewildering to me.<br><br>
I am sorry that I have not had time officially to correct an error that appeared in the <i>Hansard</i> report of my important contributions at our previous sitting. A "not" was wrongly inserted, in line 3 of the third paragraph of col. 43 and there might just be an awkward customer in the Provan constituency who would read <i>Hansard.</i> I apologise to the <i>Hansard</i> reporters. I put the mistake down to my Glasgow accent and the difficulty of understanding the nuances of the Scottish political scene. Indeed, the argument about affirmative and negative procedures would have been helped if we had had an Assembly in Scotland. It would have been an ideal candidate for detailed examination.<br><br>
However, we have established that clause 1 gives the Government powers to postpone a revaluation from the five-year term, which has existed for about 20 years. We have established that the Government have not yet made up their minds but are thinking about doing it. They will need to make an announcement about it soon. That issue leads us to clause 2.<br><br>
Clause 2 gives the power to specify that some but not all lands inherited should be revalued—"all" is the operative word in the Act at present. Therefore, the clause is a fairly fundamental departure from a procedure which until now has worked well and has been understood. Why are the Government making this change?<br><br>
Rating reform has something to do with the matter. The Prime Minister, in reply to my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) during Question Time last Thursday, confirmed this view. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We did not undertake to abolish the domestic rating system during the lifetime of this Parliament. It has always been my view, and that of my right hon and hon Friends, that the rating system will have to be abolished at some time."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
I am not making a point about this—we have already discussed it. Obviously, there is no such commitment in the life of this Parliament. However, the Prime Minister continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is thoroughly undemocratic and unfair."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 January 1981; vol. 996, c. 1530.]</p></blockquote>
The only context into which I can fit that statement is the current clamour by the Conservative Party that business interests do not have a vote. That is the only unfairness in the democratic sense that I think has been argued in recent months or years. The Prime Minister may mean .that people who make no direct contribution to local income—for instance, members of a household under domestic rating—should be rated or should contribute directly in some way.<br><br>
I am not making a great point about this matter. I am merely saying that there is a genuine doubt in everyone's mind—I think that that includes Conservative Members—about what is gong on and why we are doing this now. We think that the change is something to do with a rating reform, but we are not sure. I do not have an unduly suspicious mind, but I do not think that any case has been made for it by the Government so far. I repeat that it is a fundamental change.<br><br>
I looked at the research note on the Bill, which was helpfully produced by the Library. On clause 2—-this relates to my point about the change—it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Those lands not specified in a particular class will remain at their old valuation."</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that sentence. The note continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This clause brings the Scottish system into line with the English system. The Local Government Act 1980 allows for revaluations to be made for certain classes of property only, as, for example, non-domestic."</p></blockquote>
It has never been a very impressive argument in this place to say that, just because the English do something, we should do it in Scotland. I accept that there must be some other reason. Nevertheless, if the Library find it worth while to make this point, I must ask what the merit is in the English system compared with the Scottish system. In other words, why are we bringing it into line by giving this power to discriminate or to specify?<br><br>
The research note later states that the clause
<br><blockquote><p>"introduces a process of selectivity; the Secretary of State can choose to order the revaluation of only one category of properties, and so these will be out of line with other property values."</p></blockquote>
This is what has really worried me. I have genuinely not understood the point, and I should like to return to it.<br><br>
Last Thursday the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"one of the purposes of a revaluation is to make changes in the distribution of the rates burden as between different classes of rateable property because of changes in circumstances or other factors which justify such a change. But an additional purpose of a revaluation which is equally important is to permit a readjustment of the burden within a particular class by updating the rateable value or the net annual value of the property concerned … It will at least ensure that the rate burden is properly and fairly distributed between the different dwelling houses or commercial properties that fall within that class."</p></blockquote>
This is what I still do not understand.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
11.30 am<br><br>
The Minister is saying that one of the purposes of the clause is to ensure that there are changes in the distribution of the rates burden as between different classes of rateable property: domestic, commercial, industrial and miscellaneous. But the trend of his argument has been that the ratio must not be altered. Perhaps there is some obvious, simple flash of advice that the Minister could give which would clear this matter in my mind. I cannot see the point of this partial revaluation, and the Minister has not given us reasons for it.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman went on to speak of multipliers, divisors and ratios not 'being altered. I do not see the whole point of the exercise. I may be thick— I am not asking for comments on that—'but I still can find no strong justification for the legislation in clause 2. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the proportion of the rate burden, or the rateable value burden, borne by individual classes of property is not changed by a partial revaluation."</p></blockquote>
What is the difference between a revaluation and a partial revaluation except to throw up, legitimately, changes in the ratio? Are we passing legislation to ensure that the present ratio is fixed? I hope that this point concerns hon Members.<br><br>
It is a great advantage being able to read what the Minster says as well as listen to it. He said—this whole section in col. 72 is gobbledegook:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, however, there were a partial revaluation … it would clearly be iniquitous that, simply because some classes had been revalued and others not, the total ratio should change."</p></blockquote>
The crux of the matter is that we are taking powers to make a partial revaluation. The Minister has said deafly that it will apply to a class such as domestic, commercial, industrial or miscellaneous, which is presumably the same as a category, and that if it applies to a whole class it will apply to the whole of Scotland. But I think that he said this morning that the ratio in Scotland will not be altered. Or will it be altered within regions? That was the purpose of amendment No. 7, yet I am still not clear. The Minister must try again to explain what is meant by not altering the ratio when I should have thought that that would be one of the basic results of a revaluation. It is not necessarily its purpose, but it is an incidental result of the need to update valuations in general. No assessor sets out with the intention of saying "I am going to hammer a certain group", although some people may think their group is always being hammered. We are talking about rent and values which form the basis of a valuation. Changes have taken place and clearly those values can fluctuate. In a recession industrial and commercial premises will not be as buoyant as they are during a healthy growth in the economy. I am no expert, but although I think that I understand what is meant by a partial revaluation I am still confused about the effects of that partial revaluation and the need for it. My only clue is that in our third sitting the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The primary reason for not having a revaluation is to save time and resources which may be wasted if there are substantial changes to the rating system."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 January 1981; c. 54–72.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
Is all the hassle just because the Government may not want to have a full revaluation in 1983? The Minister should not look surprised. He has not produced a scrap of evidence to refute or support what this would seem to be. The Minister said that the Government have had discussions. I do not want to sound as if I am the only one who is niggling, but I am amazed that Conservative Members are not querying this because they always want to know the costs and savings in colleges of education. But not a single figure has been mentioned about the cost of a rating revaluation. There has been nothing said about discussions on staff savings nor any arguments put forward to support the Government's case for clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last revaluation cost between <i>£i</i> million and £1 million. Presumably the sum will be considerably greater in 1983. Those are significant amounts and if the revaluation were to prove abortive, clearly it would be foolish to incur such expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course the cost may go up as a result of inflation, but in terms of total local government expenditure the amount needed to satisfy every ratepayer that the system is fair, or as fair as possible, would be chicken feed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman does not grasp the purpose behind this. For example, if there is to be an abolition of domestic rates, it would be of no benefit to any ratepayer to have a revaluation of any kind if he would be ceasing to pay rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what he is up to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend says that that is what the Minster is up to. The Minister and the Government have declared their intention to do something about domestic rates. I am challenging the fact that it is not good psychology to say "Because of that we do not even need a current, updated valuation of all properties."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why provision is made for a partial revaluation, depending on the Government's decision. If there were a decision to abolish the whole rating system, the whole revaluation would be postponed. However, if it were thought more appropriate simply to consider the potential abolition of one set kind of rates, a partial revaluation would be the preferred option. The Government have said that unless a decision is given to local authorities early this year they will begin the work of revaluation. Therefore, it is right and proper that some procedure be available to the Secretary of State to seek to prevent what might turn out to be abortive expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even I can understand that, but it does not convince me. The Minister is saying that within the next few months the Government will need to make a decision about postponing revaluation, other-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
wise the expenditure might be abortive. That is a matter for discussion. It will depend on the time involved. The Minister has been very short of information on the attitude of the assessors or of staff. I have asked before whether NALGO was consulted, but we have not had one word about that. I may be over-sensitive, but anything to do with staffing and local authorities is a sensitive political issue.<br><br>
I am not disputing the right—whether the Opposition approve or not—of the Government to look ahead and prepare the way for possible changes in the rating system. It would still be wrong and open to much doubtful interpretation if a decision to postpone were made, which seems likely. On balance, according to the Government, it would save staff, time and therefore, money, and that is always a powerful argument when one is cutting public expenditure right, left and centre.<br><br>
Let us assume that there is a decision to postpone. That creates alarm about the Government's purpose. That is my point. Therefore, the two things must go together. The Government must clearly and openly say soon whether they intend to postpone a revaluation. There would immediately be the suspicion that one class as against another might benefit. The Minister has no powers to do that, as I understand it. The purpose of clause 1 is to fix a date. The anomalies that will have developed and are developing within the valuation system—that is part of the purpose of having a review—will be continued and exaggerated the longer the delay in revaluation.<br><br>
I do not know whether I am being difficult, but I do not think that the Government have made a case. I concede that they have made a theoretical, superficial case, but they have not made a case of any great substance. They have not indicated that there has been proper consultation. I am talking not about the principle, but about the mechanics.<br><br>
I do not think that the matter has been understood by COSLA or by many people in local authorities, because, I am sure that if they understood they would be pressing, as I am, for more information on some of the fundamental and basic principles that arise from clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put one question to the Minister about clause 2. It is a limited point, but possibly important. My understanding of clause 2—it may be incorrect, because it is a complex matter—is that it would allow the Government to revalue industrial properties but not commercial properties, or, indeed, the other way round. That seems to be a fairly undesirable power for the Government to have. I appreciate that the total burden would not change between the sectors as a whole, but clearly the burden would change within individual authorities. The industrial burden might increase in some areas and not others. Is my understanding of the clause correct? If so, what is the justification for giving the Government such a power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have listened to the debate with some horror, anger and frustration mixed with admiration for my hon Friend

the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). He has, clearly, spent an enormous amount of time trying to understand what the clause means. I am not much wiser now than I was at the outset.<br><br>
I do not want the Minister to reply to my point; it will not be worth replying to. Nevertheless, it is an important constitutional principle that I wish to try to expound on this matter.<br><br>
When I see an abstruse clause such as this, I look at the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 2 empowers him"</p></blockquote>
—the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"to direct that certain lands and heritages may be excluded from the normal processes of revaluation."</p></blockquote>
Those are 18 words which are short, succinct and intelligible, but we are not to be satisfied with that. I turn to the notes on clauses—the Minister's ABC for simple guys like me who might be on the Committee—and I find that we are supplied with three typed foolscap pages, a considerable inflation over the 18 words in the explanatory memorandum. They do not carry me much further, except to make it less intelligible than the explanatory memorandum.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I turn thirdly to the clause itself. There, as against the thousand words in the notes on clauses, we find 500 words of incomprehensible jargon. Therefore, there are three possible possibilities for a poor guy like me. I am on the Public Accounts Committee and I am on the Procedure Committee, where we get mountains of bumf from various Government Departments. In fact, their main weapon of defence against any possible challenge from the legislature is bumf— "Drown them in it"—and that is what we get.<br><br>
In the course of a 35-minute speech on Second Reading, the Secretary of State made a two-second reference to clause 2. It is interesting that the Under-Secretary himself, in an intervention a few moments ago in the speech of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), made the same point as the Secretary of State made in the most important part of the Second Reading debate. The right hon Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The powers conferred by clauses 1 and 2 might be required as a preliminary to more extensive reforms."</p></blockquote>
That is the whole purpose of the clause.<br><br>
The Minister has said in previous speeches that the Government's immediate purpose is to abolish domestic rates. He went out of his way to say that almost in specific terms to my hon Friend just now. On Second Reading the Secretary of State specifically mentioned clause 2 in these terms:
<br><blockquote><p>"clause 2 will enable only certain classes of lands and heritages to be subject to the normal processes of revaluation. To make possible such a restriction in the scope of revaluations is entirely consistent with our policy towards domestic rates which assumes that radical reform may apply to only one part of the rating system."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; vol. 995, c. 1219-20.]</p></blockquote>
In the subsequent debate this point was not token up. I think that it was referred to in passing by my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), the former Secretary of State, but there were no other references by other hon Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
who took part in that debate. I do not know why they did not refer to it. Perhaps they thought .that it was not important, or, more likely, like me they found it incomprehensible.<br><br>
I have listened to my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden and to the replies given by the Minister, and I still do not know the purposes of the clause, except those hinted at by the Secretary of State. We must remember that the Bill will have to be read by our nice, decent local councillors, let us suppose that they read paragraph <i>(b),</i> which deals with five new subsections to be added after section 1(6) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975. Subsection (6A), one of the simpler parts, which is the first new subsection to be added to the 1975 Act, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State makes an order under subparagraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a) above, he may prescribe by order under this subsection (either or both)—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) a method whereby the net annual value of the specified lands and heritages shall be adjusted for the purposes of ascertaining their rateable value;"—</p></blockquote>
and goes on and on ad nauseam. My part-time councillor in Kirkcaldy or Dunfermline must try to make sense of that. We ought to have a system of examinations where a Minister sits down, without being briefed by his civil servants, and is cross-examined by hon Members about the meaning of particular points instead of sitting on the Front Bench—I am not referring particularly to the Under-Secretary—not really listening to what is being said 'because he knows that he will be fed with the stuff from the top table. The Minister .gets his corn from the civil servants who are doing the work, so he is as innocent and incomprehending as the rest of us. The people at that top table, not politicians who have been directly elected by the people are deciding what goes through the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend saying that the proposed Committees would exist at a pre-legislative stage? Is that where this examination would take place? It would be useful in the context of clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been very useful if, on this Bill, we could have engaged in the experiment that has been enunciated in the House as a matter of principle, namely, that before we discussed the Bill we could have examined Ministers, and others from outside the House, on the precise meaning of the Bill and why certain points had been included.<br><br>
If the civil servants had been kept out entirely and we had been able to have half a dozen sessions with the Minister we might have been better off than we are at the moment. We could have said "Right, you explain to us, in lay terms, exactly what clause 2 means"—without reference to the little bits of paper that have 'been fed to him every five minutes by the civil servants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There might have been an advantage in such a process. It would have resulted in a delay, and by the time the matter had been thoroughly investigated the Government might have made up their minds. We would have known what Ministers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
were thinking about the clause, the purpose of which is to pave the way for rating reform.<br><br>
At the moment all the Government are telling us is that the legislation is needed in case they choose to reform the rating system at some later date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have quoted what the Secretary of State said about the clause. I think that we all understand that the clause is, undoubtedly, meant to create a degree of flexibility in the rating system the better to enable the Secretary of State, at some future date, to get rid of domestic rates.<br><br>
If we are to control the quality and nature of legislation debated, it is important for all Back Bench Members in a Committee such as this to comprehend that legislation.<br><br>
If, as a former school teacher, I had to set an examination on the Bill for Back-Bench Members, I would say: "All right, without briefing explain in lay language what subsection (6A) of clause 2 means." It empowers the Secretary of State, where he has made an order under the new proviso of subsection (3Xa) of the 1975 Act to prescribe by a further order
<br><blockquote><p>"a method whereby the net annual value of the specified lands and heritages"</p></blockquote>
which have been revalued, or
<br><blockquote><p>"the unspecified lands and heritages"</p></blockquote>
which have not been revalued
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be adjusted for the purposes of ascertaining their rateable value"</p></blockquote>
I should ask for that to be explained in lay language. Without advice or guidance from the Department or the Minister, I doubt whether any member of the Committee, apart from my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden, could get more than 5 out of 10 for explaining what that means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that neither my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) .nor the Minister are laymen? Both are lawyers. We are, perhaps, at a disadvantage because the Minister is a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to say anything reprehensible about lawyers, because of my great respect for my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden. However, he is an exception to the general rule.<br><br>
Having read the clause many times and having spent many hours in trying to understand it, I get a general impression that it gives the Secretary of State enormous powers which have hitherto never been available to him in this regard. I shall give one example. In an earlier speech the Minister referred to subsection (6D), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order under this subsection—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) repeal or amend any enactment (including this Act) in so far as that enactment relates to the valuation of lands and heritages."</p></blockquote>
It is not good enough to say that that provision is in an earlier Act passed by a Labour Government. That is no defence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon Gentleman vote against it?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an example of the sort of yahboo politics that I get browned off with. That is no argument in favour of giving the Secretary of State powers to repeal Acts of Parliament by order. After a debate lasting an hour and a half, is the Secretary of State to be given power to repeal a whole Act of Parliament, which might have been bogged down in a Standing Committee for hours and hours? After a debate lasting one and a half hours are we to empower the Secretary of State to say "Out it goes"?<br><br>
I have examined the Bill with interest. Subsection (6A) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State makes an order under subparagraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a)."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (6B) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any method prescribed under subsection (6A) above shall be such as in the opinion of the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That means that the Secretary of State will decide. The same applies in (6C). Even when the Secretary of State is consulting local authority associations there is a proviso. The reason for its inclusion is incomprehensible to me. Subsection (6C) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"any association of local authorities which appears to him to represent the interests of local authorities."</p></blockquote>
As far as I know, there is only one local authority body in Scotland. Why should the words
<br><blockquote><p>"which appears to him to represent"</p></blockquote>
be there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman> Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Arrogance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. That was the word I was looking for. It is an indication of the power that the Secretary of State wants to presume to himself. The words are unnecessary. I have already quoted subsection (6D), where the Secretary of State seeks to give himself power to get rid of an Act almost by a wink of an eye at 11 o'clock or 11.30 on a Tuesday night, a Wednesday night, or a Thursday night, when Scottish Members are leaving to catch their trains.<br><br>
I shall carry the argument no further, except to say that the kind of debate that we have had on clause 2 makes a mockery of democratic or legislative control of the executive arm of Government. Jargon like this could be made much simpler for Members if the will existed. I believe that the words are being made deliberately and unnecessarily obscure for governmental purposes.<br><br>
Whatever his absurd Tory views may be, the Minister is a good parliamentarian and a reasonable guy. I hope that he will take our message and tell his draftsmen "Look, we have simple-minded fellows like the Member for Fife, Central on that Committee. We must make these clauses more easily understood by these fellows." That would be one way to lessen the gulf between the Executive and the Legislature. I hope that the Minister will take that point on board.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is right to emphasise again the sweeping powers which the Secretary of State is taking in the clause. My hon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
Friend has already detailed those passages which give offence. It is important that the Committee should consider the powers given to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
My hon Friend has said that the Under-Secretary is a relatively reasonable Tory as Tories go. But who knows? The next Under-Secretary who wears his shoes could be the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) or even the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). The mind boggles. It is not right that any Committee should put sweeping powers in the hands of such people.<br><br>
My hon Friends have also covered in this clause stand part debate the question whether the clause is properly understood by the Committee, the Minister or anybody else. I have been sitting here quietly nursing the chip on my shoulder and thinking that I was perhaps the only simpleton to have difficulty in understanding the full horror of this clause. My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central has made it clear that he does not understand the clause. He and I are not alone, because the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) said in his intervention that he did not understand it, although the Minister says that he does.<br><br>
I see that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) has briefly left the Committee, but I defy him—or anyone else—to explain in words of one syllable the meaning of, for example, (6B):
<br><blockquote><p>"Any method prescribed under subsection (6A) above shall be such as in the opinion of the Secretary of State will preserve the ratio which he estimates will exist immediately before the coming into force of the new valuation roll between, as regards Scotland as a whole, the rateable values of specified lands and heritages and those of unspecified lands and heritages."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the Minister in his earlier answers has satisfactorily explained in comprehensible English the meaning of that section—or any other. It would be wrong for the Committee to accept the clause as it stands without proper explanation of its meaning. This is the only forum where it is possible for representatives of the ratepayers of Scotland to discover the meaning of the clauses which will affect the amount of rates they pay and the services they will receive for them.<br><br>
At our last sitting. I asked the Minister one or two specific questions which he has not answered adequately. The first concerns a word which my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) mentioned. It is in clause 2(a)(i), which says
<br><blockquote><p>"only such classes of lands and heritages as may be specified in the order shall be so valued or revalued".</p></blockquote>
I suggested earlier that "classes" need not necessarily take into account only—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must warn the Committee that a certain amount of tedious repetition is beginning to appear. When amendments have been discussed already, they should be referred to only superficially in a stand part debate. The hon. Gentleman was here when the Minister 'replied. The Committee accepted the Minister's replies. I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
approve of continuous debate along the lines taken on amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Gourlay, I accept your point that these questions should be touched on only superficially at this stage. However, my concern is that the Minister gave extremely superficial replies. At our last sitting the Minister gave the Committee an assurance that
<br><blockquote><p>"the conspiracy theory is only a theory."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 January 1981; c. 77.]</p></blockquote>
I contend that the theory remains a possibility. It would still be possible for any Secretary of State under these powers to discriminate in favour of occupiers or owners of one class of property as against those of another class of property, and those classifications need not be defined as they normally have been as domestic, commercial or industrial. It would be possible under these powers, whether the Minister likes it or not—.these are the powers that he is seeking from the Committee—for the Government to discriminate between different classifications in the future. It is worrying that we should be passing a clause which contains such provisions.<br><br>
Another point which I made earlier concerned whether local authorities would toe compensated for any reduction in the rating base within their jurisdiction, if the future or present Secretary of State were to take advantage of the powers which he may or may not obtain under the clause. It would toe .possible, if a revaluation were to be delayed—even taking into account all the ratios, dividers and multipliers that we have heard about—for there to be a reduction in proportionate terms of the total valuation of properties within a local authority's area, which could .reduce its rating base and therefore make it less easy for it to raise the money required to provide its services. The point that I made earlier, to which the Minister has not yet replied, is whether rate support grants in the future will foe adjusted to take account of the reduction in rating resources of individual local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall, of course, vote against this legislation. Before I say why, I welcome the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to the Government Front Bench. I recognise that the Patronage Secretary has appointed him on a temporary basis, without any other form of patronage being involved. We commiserate with him, and hope that his stay will be fairly enjoyable. I am sure that he is grateful to be there this morning, because, if the tradition of his predecessor is anything to go by, it prevents him from having to speak on a clause of almost total incomprehensibility. He is spared that difficulty, although if be wishes to speak, we shall listen to him with the rapt attention which we pay to all his speeches in the House.<br><br>
As my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) remarked, the Opposition would have welcomed a means of explaining the clause in greater detail in the non-adversarial atmosphere of a Select Committee instead of a Standing Committee. We are concerned that clauses 1 and 2 provide the paving for the road to rating reform. We feel that clause 2 is unsatisfactory, as the Govern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
ment are not really able or willing to tell us about their intentions. We know that they have a commitment to end domestic rating.<br><br>
We heard the Prime Minister's remarks last week at Question Time. Many of us have grave misgivings about where the burdens would be shifted to. Opposition Members are not happy about the prospect of an end to domestic rating, with the burdens being transferred elsewhere. Therefore, we are opposed to the purpose of the clause.<br><br>
We are also worried that the Government have sought to introduce legislation in Scotland simply to bring Scotland into line with England. The English legislation was carried last year and the matter on which the Government had to decide was put before them in the summer of last year when the Local Government, Planning and Land Act was being completed. It is an undue delay. Had the Government hurried up, the clause would have been much clearer.<br><br>
We have heard some mumblings about figures. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has quoted a reply from the then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment which referred to a saving of about £5 million by the postponement of the 1982—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I unintentionally misled my hon Friend on that point. The £5 million was what was lost as a result of the work done on the 1982 revaluation which was 'being postponed by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, if the work had not been carried out, more than £5 million might have been saved.<br><br>
On a rough and ready basis, from the Minister's figure of between £½ million and £1 million for Scotland, I should imagine that, given the efficiency of the assessor's departments in Scotland and their expertise in these matters, which is far greater than that of their English counterparts, the saving might have been about £½ million. Therefore, the financial justification for clause 2 is about <i>£½</i> million. That amount is a flea-bite in terms of the budget for local government expenditure in Scotland. Certainly, if the saving will only he of that order, the Minister or at least the Department should have consulted appropriate trade unions and COSLA, as my hon Friend the Member for Provan said.<br><br>
Clause 2 is an attempt to change existing practices to save an amount of money which, albeit small, will cause anxiety to that section of local government which would he directly in line were any staff cuts to take place.<br><br>
The clause will afford the Secretary of State the right to introduce some kind of partial revaluation. We are not happy about that prospect because we have felt all along that the revaluation procedures have worked fairly satisfactorily and that a piecemeal approach would be to the detriment of the work done in the past.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
We are also very worried about the wide, sweeping powers which will be afforded to the Secretary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
of State. This was graphically pointed out by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). We know that the Minister is a fairly reasonable individual. However, within the parameters of unreasonableness, even in the Scottish Conservative group—a relatively small number—if certain people were given power of office, we should have grave concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend reconsider calling the Under-Secretary reasonable? First, it is doing irreparable damage to his career; secondly, there is no evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. While I allowed the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) to make certain observations, I did not intend that the debate should go any wider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am nevertheless grateful to my hon Friend for his caution and I take his point on board.<br><br>
It would be wrong for us to identify the powers being afforded to the Secretary of State with the person who at present holds the responsibility for exercising those powers. I shudder to think what would happen if, for example, the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), as a consolation prize for not getting the chairmanship of the Select Committee, were offered a position in the Government. I have sat through several sittings of the Select Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that the debate is getting somewhat away from clause stand part. I hope that the hon Gentleman will return to his central point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are to afford the Secretary of State wide-ranging powers, it would be wrong for us to confuse these powers with the individuals who at present have the responsibility for exercising them.<br><br>
While some of us may not have major misgivings —I take on board what my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said—about a fairly reasonable individual such as the Under-Secretary having responsibility for this matter and being subject to controls by the House, albeit unsatisfactory controls—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that it is right that the Committee should dwell on this issue of how reasonable or unreasonable a particular Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon Gentleman is seeking to challenge the Chair, there is another method for doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point has been adequately ventilated.<br><br>
We are opposed to the clause for many of the reasons that we were opposed to clause 1. We see it as a means of carrying the Government's plans for rating reform further along the road. If it is not that, it is a waste of our time, because those plans
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
will not achieve their objective. We feel that in the past 18 months the Government have had plenty of opportunity to assess the case for rating reform. To assume these powers without carrying out some kind of rating reform would be a waste of the time of the House.<br><br>
We are also concerned that the powers are sweeping, that they are not subject to the democratic controls which we would wish and that they do not take account in the more specific sense of some of the bodies which should be involved. The Government have already introduced proposals without what we would regard as adequate consultation with those involved. Secondly—this is only a minor point which we dwelt on earlier—we feel that there was a strong case for placing the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities in a rather special position by enshrining it in the legislation.<br><br>
However, we feel that the Government have not made an adequate case. They are introducing a piecemeal element to what has been in Scotland a most satisfactory form of revaluation. If the Government choose to reform the rating system, as they have the right to do, they will have to have some partial system of revaluation. Again, we have misgivings and we do not like its piecemeal nature.<br><br>
Lastly, we are perturbed about the powers given to the Secretary of State. If they are not to be used for rating reform, the only argument for the clause is that there might be savings of about £½million. If these savings are the only justification, my hon Friends and I shall have no alternative but to vote against the clause.<br><br>
We seem this morning to be reaching the stage at which the Government will have to tell us why the legislation is being enacted and why these powers are being given to the Secretary of State. We have as yet been given no clear or specific reason. The best that the Minister can tell us is that in the near future the Government will come to a decision. The Opposition submit that since the passing of the English legislation last summer there has been time for the Government to make up their mind. They would not have presented the English legislation if they had not seriously considered reform a year ago.<br><br>
The Opposition would like the Minister to come clean and tell us once and for all what the Government have concluded. Not even a feeble-minded Government like this one can fail to come to a firm conclusion on this issue. Had it been the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) who had to take the decision I could have understood the reasons for backtracking. The way in which he has gone round in circles on the issue of the colleges of education is evidence that some sections of the Government are capable of flying in the face of their previous statements.<br><br>
The hon Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) has shown himself to be prepared to take decisions. In this instance either he is not being allowed to take decisions because they are too important and someone of his junior rank is not allowed to take them, or he is spending anxious, sleepless nights trying to work out whether the domestic, the industrial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
or the commercial sectors should bear the burden of rates, or whether they should be milked from North Sea oil.<br><br>
We shall vote against the clause. I shall wait with interest to hear the Minister's reply, as will my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who will doubtless wish to comment further from the Opposition Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to comment briefly in the clause stand part debate.<br><br>
I share the views expressed by my hon Friends the Members for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) when they complained that the entire clause was obscure. We have had no clear statement from the Minister, in laymen's terms as to what the clause means. Indeed, it has been pointed out that the clause has been written in order to be obscure. It is not reasonable for the Minister to have avoided telling us in clear English what the clause provides, because my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said at our last sitting that he found it
<br><blockquote><p>"opaque and at times downright difficult." <i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 January 1981; c.49.]</p></blockquote>
Both the and the Minister are lawyers. I should tell the Committee the difference between these two lawyers: the Minister gives us the law, but my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden is moved by the spirit. That has been the problem. My hon Friend the Member for Garscadden has taken it upon himself to probe the provisions of the clause and has revealed to us something of what it says. The Minister has carefully avoided doing that. I do not know why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is his job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's job is to explain to the Committee precisely why these provisions are being included in the legislation.<br><br>
When I read clause 2 I was reminded of the Book of Revelations, which is not at all revealing. Those like me and you, Mr. Gourlay, who frequently study the scriptures—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I study the Standing Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that of all the books of scripture, the Book of Revelations is the most difficult.<br><br>
The Minister will go down in history as the man who wrote the most obscure clause ever put into a Bill— this clause.<br><br>
According to the Library briefs that I have read, the clause
<br><blockquote><p>"empowers the Secretary of State to direct that certain lands and heritages may be excluded from any revaluation that takes place.''</p></blockquote>
The question, simply, is why. We have not had a satisfactory answer to that. The Library brief says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The present law is that of the 1975 Act, section 1, which requires an assessor to secure the valuation or revaluation of <i>all</i> lands and heritages."</p></blockquote>
That is so. But the brief continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This provision will give the Secretary of State the power to define which classes of lands are to be valued"</p></blockquote>
and those which are to remain at the old valuation.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
I have had great difficulty with that description. I have spent my life reading obscure documents written between trade unions and employers—God knows that they were capable of writing very obscure documents, and often I had a hand in their obscurity. I have also had the problem, as a layman, of reading the law— notwithstanding occasional help from a firm of lawyers that I very nearly mentioned, but shall not.<br><br>
I think that it was the hon Member for Fife, Central who asked what was the particular merit of bringing the law of Scotland into line with the law of England. I am no nationalist—that is well known. I have dedicated my life to the resistance of nationalism—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the Tories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they seem to be self-destructing. What particular merit is there in uniformity of law between England and Scotland on matters of revaluation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That does not arise. We are considering the principle of the clause standing part of the Bill. We are not concerned with comparing the English statute with the Scottish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gourlay, but the principle behind the clause is, in part, to bring—I seek your guidance on this—the law of Scotland into line with the law of England and Wales. I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay, but, clearly, I do not understand the ruling that you are making. Perhaps you could clarify the position for me later.<br><br>
However, we have posed these questions time and time again when moving the amendments and we have not received adequate replies. I hope that the Minister will answer them now in layman's terms and in a way which will be understood by all who will read the Committee's proceedings in conjunction with the Bill. We shall then know what is happening. As long as the matter is clouded in this way and the Government refuse to clarify their intentions, I shall have no part of the clause and will vote against it.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for not having been here earlier. I think that you, Mr. Gourlay, will understand and excuse me when I say that I have, with the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), been looking after the interests of the supporters of Raith Rovers and other teams. Unfortunately, the news from 16 Lancaster Gate is not very good and our mission was not as successful as we should like it to have been.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Didmy hon Friend get a ticket?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am not able to answer that question. As my hon Friend will know, the part of the country that I come from is not unknown for its generosity, so whatever sum he may offer me for the ticket—if I get it —would be no inducement whatever to sell it.<br><br>
Now that I am here, I am pleased that we are still discussing clause 2. I played very little part in the discussion of the amendments, because I wanted only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
to make a few comments on the principle of the Bill. I do not share my hon Friend's views about the clause being difficult to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not spend my weekends tilling the soil, like my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I think that the clause is fairly simple. A great deal of confusion has been brought about during our debates, mainly by Ministers. My hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for replying in detail".—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 January 1981; C.73.]</p></blockquote>
I was not grateful to the Minister for replying in detail because I think that he confused the whole issue.<br><br>
I think that there is a simple provision in the clause for excluding certain lands and heritages from valuation or revaluation, and that is the issue of principle on which we are concentrating. The Minister may have explained it this morning in my absence, in which case I forgive him, but I do not think that he has given us the motivation behind the clause, which I think both sides would like to hear—why it exists, where it came from, and so on. Last week I asked the Minister where the clause was drafted and who inspired it. He gave me a number of obscure replies, for example, that it came from the collective wisdom of his Department. I doubt that the collective wisdom of his Department would come up with this clause, but even if it did, I should still be interested to learn the inspiration behind it.<br><br>
I understand that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) asked earlier whether the provision will bring us into line with provisions in England and whether it is related to the question of rate support grant. When the Minister eventually manages to respond to the debate, will he tell us the relationship between what is suggested here and the position south of the border? I hope that he will genuinely respond to that because it is an issue of principle whether, as some of us fear, we are being forced to come into line with what happens south of the border.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us whether, if we had had a Scottish Assembly—as he sometimes, and I always, would have liked—we would have seen this kind of provision? Or is it part of an exercise, principally guided by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for the Environment, to put the screw on local authorities? In that way there is a subtle change in parts of the valuation to enable certain ratepayers to be squeezed by the rate support grant formula.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain the provision's relation to the rate support grant formula and whether he envisages an inter-relationship. There could be one, so will he explain the motivation for that?<br><br>
It might be possible to change the balance of rate burden between inner city areas and county areas. In retrospect, I hope that my hon Friend does not find me disloyal in saying that. I know the punishments that are meted out for disloyalty. We have seen how the right hon Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) suffered for alleged disloyalty.<br><br>
I have thought again about the provision's application to the whole of Scotland about which my hon Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
the Member for Garscadden extracted an assurance from the Under-Secretary. Certain deleterious effects might result from that. The rate burden might be switched from county to inner city areas. If I read the situation correctly, that would be possible. Most Labour Members in Scotland represent inner city areas. My hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian and I are exceptions. Most Conservative Members represent county areas. A significant political advantage could be gained by excluding certain lands from valuation, changing the balance of the rates burden in favour of a particular category which is dominant in inner city areas and not so in county areas. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will answer that point.<br><br>
It also occurred to me to relate the clause—perhaps my hon Friends have already done so—to the Prime Minister's statement last week about the dual vote. If they seriously intend to pursue the question of giving the vote to ratepayers—and I hope that they do not, apart from the nonsense of public utilities and nationalised industries—that raises the subtle political relationship which might encourage Government Ministers to derive political advantage from this matter.<br><br>
I hope that when the Under-Secretary replies he will give us an inkling of the motivation behind the clause. We are still agog. We may have greater or lesser degrees of understanding of what the clause means, but none of us has yet had an explanation of why it is being imposed on us. I have expressed some of our suspicions. I always suspect the Under-Secretary of having political motives, because I do not share the views of my hon Friend. I have had the experience—not the pleasure—of standing against the Under-Secretary—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already accused certain hon Members of straying from clause stand part, and I think that the hon Gentleman is beginning to do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of my hon Friends, Mr. Gourlay, has had the experience of standing against the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not form part of the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a Raith Rovers supporter so I cannot claim any other immunity, Mr. Gourlay. I take your admonition and return to the point.<br><br>
My hon Friends have been saying that we must not agree on any piece of legislation because of the complexion of the particular Minister presenting it at any time. My conclusion about the radicalism or otherwise of the Under-Secretary's views is completely different from that of my hon Friend. But the political complexion or the flexibility of the Minister at any one time does not matter: we are talking about legislation. The Minister himself said that he has drawn up the legislation so that we shall need to legislate less in the future. The legislation will be more longstanding and will avoid the need for primary legislation in the future because it will continue year after year, decade after decade.<br><br>
Therefore, we must pay much greater attention to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
points being made about the permanence of the legislation.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your patience. My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central told me not to shout and that I sometimes talk as if I were addressing a meeting at Hampden Park, Wembley Stadium or even other grounds that I shall not mention. But on this occasion I have tried to be as reasonable, quiet and as non-controversial as possible with the specific, deliberate and I hope not futile intention of getting from the Minister at least once some indication of the real motivation behind this clause. If I am not given that answer I shall go away a disappointed man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the winding-up speech which the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) concluded 25 minutes ago. I am now happy to reply to the debate on which he summed up for the Opposition. The hon Gentleman was good enough to refer to me as a reasonable man. I recollect that his previous definition of respectability was to be named in an Act of Parliament. He may be interested to know that my name together with those of my right hon Friend the Secretary of State, my hon Friend the Under-Secretary and my right hon Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury all appear on the face of the Bill. I hope that the hon Gentleman will draw the necessary conclusions.<br><br>
The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and his colleagues expressed their concern that at this stage in the debate they are still not clear about the purpose of this clause and clause 1. I should be guilty of tedious repetition if I were to give again the purpose of these clauses. It has been said again and again that they are simply to ensure that there is no danger of abortive expenditure of considerable sums of money, time and effort on a revaluation, the purpose of which might be negated if there were significant changes in the rating system in Scotland. That is the sole purpose, and the full extent of the purpose, of these clauses. If Opposition Members are still unaware of the purpose of these clauses, there is nothing I can add to my previous general comments.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) asked whether a distinction could be drawn between partial revaluation of commercial property and that for industrial property. He is correct in that with the drafting of the Bill in its present form any partial revaluation could include one of these categories and not the other. It would clearly have been prejudging the matter to specify in the clause which were to be revalued and where there was to be no partial revaluation. It is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would draw a distinction between commercial and industrial property. I must ask my hon Friend to await a decision on the matter.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) made an eloquent appeal for simpler drafting both of this clause and of other legislation. I understand and appreciate his point, which has been made on many occasions. I simply ask him to consider that in legislation we seek to do two things. We seek to make legislation comprehensible to those who will read it, but it is more important that it should be exact, because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0584">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
legislation affects the rights, liabilities and liberties of individual citizens and public bodies. It is therefore more important that the clear purpose of the legislation should be defined in strict terms that can be clearly determined by the courts if there is a dispute, rather than that there should be simplification that would lead to confusion and ambiguity.<br><br>
The general public do not read Acts. There is no reason why they should. Normally those who have to go through the labours of studying the precise terms of an Act are familiar with the drafting conventions, although that is no excuse for complexity. I think the hon Gentleman will agree that successive Governments have sought to simplify legislation, and it has proved an extremely difficult task unless one is prepared to sacrifice certainty in the process.<br><br>
The hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), and other hon Gentlemen asked whether there would be any effect on the rate support grant as a result of a partial revaluation which changed the base rates. There is no automatic consequence for the revenue of a local authority as a result of revaluation. Normally, if there have been changes as a result of revaluation the rate poundage is adjusted accordingly in order to produce a comparable income. That would clearly follow in the present case.<br><br>
Even if the resources base of a local authority were affected by revaluation, it is the resources element, which is within the rate support grant formula, that is intended to equalise the payments made to individual local authorities arising out of differential resource potential in various parts of Scotland. That would clearly apply in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does it not follow from that that if the Secretary of State were to postpone revaluation of one class or category of land or heritage, it would force those local authorities which have a high proportion of that type of land or heritage within their boundary to put up their rate poundage? Is the hon Gentleman giving an indication that those local authorities that would suffer in that way would be fully compensated through the resources element?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has failed to understand the effect of the clause. There would be no consequence of the kind he has indicated, because of the specific requirement that the ratio between revalued and non-revalued classes of property has to be maintained. Because it has to be maintained, there is no danger of any one class of property suffering as a consequence of not being subject to a revaluation in terms of the clause. I can therefore categorically assure the hon Gentleman that there is no change in the total burden shared by a particular class of property if a partial revaluation takes place.<br><br>
The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) asked whether the provisions simply followed comparable provisions in England and Wales. That would not be a fair conclusion. Such provisions and the need for them were determined by the Government on a United Kingdom basis some time ago. It so happens that when an English local government Bill went through the House during the last Session there was no Scottish Bill. There was therefore no opportunity to put forward a similar provision for Scotland in the last
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
Session. No one is following or coming into line with anyone else. A decision was taken at the same time to make a similar change in the various parts of the United Kingdom, and this is the first legislative opportunity to bring into force the provision now in the Bill.<br><br>
I appreciate that the Opposition may wish to divide the Committee on the clause. I do not believe that they have put forward any substantial or credible reasons for doing so, but that is a matter which they must determine for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to the end of our long consideration of the clause. I assure the Committee that I have every intention of ensuring that we complete that consideration before we rise this morning.<br><br>
I believe that it has been a useful debate. The Under-Secretary of State has been helpful in many of his explanations on technical points. Most of us are a little happier at least about some of the detail of the complexities of the clause.<br><br>
I am a little sorry that we did not manage to enshrine COSLA in statute. It might have been some consolation for the fact that thanks to the Under-Secretary its members are not to be entombed in the Royal High School for their deliberations. May I tell the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) that despite the pretty compliments and well-turned phrases of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), I do not take the view that anyone can quite fill the shoes of the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who is both noble and learned and conducts the affairs of the Government Chief Whip with the ineffable touch of aristocratic distinction. Although I know that the hon Member for South Angus will try hard, 1 doubt whether he will quite do so.<br><br>
I enjoyed the discussion of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) about the Committee and the system drowning in bumf. We could have a learned debate about whether one drowns in bumf. I should have thought that one stifles or suffocates in it, is choked with it, or perhaps is obliterated under a heap of it, but, certainly I should not have thought that one drowned in bumf. But perhaps we should leave that point at this moment.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said that he did not think that we had made out a case for voting against the clause. I believe that the onus is on the Under-Secretary. He is asking us to include an important provision in the Bill, which, if implemented, would lead to considerable complexities, complications, expense and anxiety for local government. It is quite clear that he must fully illustrate why and in what circumstances it is necessary, and he has to convince us that it is machinery which can be operated efficiently in the interests of ratepayers and the community as a whole. That may sound an unreasonably high test but I believe that the responsibility rests with the Government to be positive on this matter.<br><br>
Most of us have grasped at least the outlines of the scheme. I accept that there may be limited virtue in saying that a partial revaluation would allow a readjustment of the burden within a class of ratepayers and that the balancing machinery in the subsequent provisons of the new subsections 6A and 6B would ensure that major distortions did not result.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
I think that I understand that case—that the blocks shall remain stable and in ratio, as they have been, but that within the blocks there should be adjustments between one ratepayer and another in the same class of property. I do not say that it is a totally unworkable scheme. However, it does not seem that the limited virtue of such an adjustment—a kind of neutered, hamstrung revaluation—is justified on the case put by the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary made this point in one sentence. He said that the purpose was to ensure that work was not done in a revaluation which would never be put into effect, probably because of a far-reaching reform which took that class of property out of the rating system completely. That seems to be a major reform which would require complicated primary legislation. I am not convinced that we need on the statute book such running power to introduce and make by order a fundamental change which would presumably be enshrined in primary legislation and which would be very much a one-off job, if that is not too undignified a way of describing it.<br><br>
Certainly, I hope that the Government's meandering thoughts—they have been talking for many years about rating reform—are finally focussed and brought to the House as positive proposals which we shall judge on their merits. I do not even presuppose that those proposals will necessarily be bad. We have not seen them and we do not know exactly what is in the Government's mind. However, I hope that at some time something emerges from the complex and obscure cerebral processes of the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Secretary of State for Scotland and various other members of the Cabinet.<br><br>
If reform does come, it will come in a major Bill to change the whole rating system. The transitional arrangements can then be dealt with for that one-off situation, for that special set of circumstances that is then created. I am not convinced that the very complicated and convoluted statutory provision represented by clause 2 should be put upon the statute book as a kind of standing threat to the stability of the present rating system.<br><br>
By all means, let us go for reform, but let us not put something on the statute book in case at some future date the reform comes. Secretaries of State are open to temptation and may think it convenient to use these powers irrespective of whether reform is imminent. Only under negative procedures of the House could we then force a debate that would last one and a half hours on that fundamental and important proposal.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary himself implied earlier— absolutely rightly—that we are entitled to be a little
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
cynical about the value of affirmative, never mind negative, resolutions of the House as a form of Back-Bench scrutiny. There is nothing more important than transitional arrangements in local government finance, rating and valuation and related fields. When we come to the housing support grant in the House on Wednesday night, for example, we shall no doubt be considering the impact of the ending of transitional arrangements and the considerable change that they have made to the housing support grant settlement this year.<br><br>
Therefore, transitional and paving arrangements of this kind ought to be given the closest scrutiny and should be possible of amendment. That cannot be achieved, if clause 2 goes on the statute book as it stands. If we need that machinery, it ought to be tailored to the moment and included in the primary legislation. I do not believe that the positive onus has been discharged or that the positive case which has to be made by the Minister has been made on this occasion. Therefore, I have no hesitation in advising my hon Friends to vote against the retention of the clause.</span></p>
