THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered Class XV, Votes 3 to 10, 12, 14 to 16, 20 and 24, and Class XVIII, Votes 5, 8 and 14.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition chose this subject for debate because the nation's health must have priority. We believe in a comprehensive National Health Service for all. We reject the Government's adherence to privatisation. The Opposition want more spent on health and personal social services.<br><br>
The Government claim that that is what they are doing, and it will become apparent as the debate unfolds what the real position is—a position that we believe reflects no credit on the present Administration. The debate will review the condition of the Health Service and the personal social services. We shall hear, at least from hon. Members on the Labour Benches, of falling standards and low staff morale—staff morale, which is so vital to the effectiveness of the service.<br><br>
The Opposition wish to develop the subject of expenditure on updating and upgrading the service. We shall want to know the consequences of the Secretary of State's attack on local authority spending on social work—what it will mean for the elderly, what it will do to the home care services and what the cuts imposed on the regional councils will mean for care in the community.<br><br>
We shall wish to put questions about health education and its impact on alcoholism in Scotland, which we believe to be a serious worry. Those are questions that the Minister must answer.<br><br>
The Government have much to say about their priorities for the Health Service and personal social services. Indeed, that was the subject of much comment by the Secretary of State himself when he addressed the Select Committee on 15 June. On that occasion, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If we did see any room for increases in the public capital expenditure programmes, they would be concentrated, I would think, on those areas of high priority such as health and social work, such as law and order, which are priority programmes, and I think that would be the right way to do it."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"we have tried to and succeeded in maintaining priorities which the Government laid down, that is to say presser-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
vation of the health service budgets, preservation to a great degree of those on social services etc., on social work and defence, and the reductions therefore—and law and order is another—are concentrated more severely on the others".</p></blockquote>
That is what the Secretary of State said that his priorities were, but the Opposition are more than a little suspicious about who is spending more on health and social services. Whose priority is the wellbeing of those services? I believe that it is good regional councils that have their priorities right. That is borne out if one refers to the rating review published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. If the Minister cares to examine the figures for spending on social work per head of population, he will see that £61-83 is spent by Lothian regional council and £62-97 by the Western Isles regional council, but that of the Conservative regional councils, which are often quoted in other contexts, Grampian regional council is spending £32·36 and Tayside regional council £40·66.<br><br>
The question is, whose priority is it? I do not know, but it seems to me that Lothian regional council comes in for a great deal of criticism from the hon. Gentleman and his hon Friends. All the time we hear about Lothian regional council, and a sustained campaign has been conducted against that authority, although it appears to have the same priorities as the Secretary of State. If we are to believe what the right hon. Gentleman said to the Select Committee, namely, that the Government had set the priorities—the Health Service and the personal social services—it is Lothian regional council and the Western Isles regional council, whose politics I do not begin to understand, which apparently have got their priorities right and not the Secretary of State. Yet he is claiming the credit. That is unfair, because Lothian regional council is endeavouring to do a job and meet a commitment for which the Government are claiming credit while, at the same time, they are condemning the council for all its other programmes which are vital to its community.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister can help his right hon. Friend. I hope that he will tell the Committee whether the priority spending given to the personal social services by regional councils is to be deducted from the totality of spending on the National Health Service in Scotland and the personal social services. What does that leave as the Government's contribution to the claimed increase in spending and the claimed maintenance of standards of which the Secretary of State made so much when he appeared before the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs in Edinburgh on 15 June? I strongly suspect that the Government's claims in the White Paper on public expenditure are somewhat dubious. For those who approve of accuracy, pages 140 to 145 deal with the issues in global figures, but the Opposition want to know the real, hard facts.<br><br>
I want to deal with some unpleasant facts about this Government's record in the Health Service, the first of which concerns overseas students. I was interested to read in the Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i> of 2 June 1981 a report about representations being.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook), which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"A protest at proposals to charge overseas students the full cost of any medical treatment under the National Health Service has been launched by an Edinburgh MP."</p></blockquote>
The article names the hon. Member concerned and says that he
<br><blockquote><p>" warns that such Government action could mean that more Third World students will turn to Communist countries for their university education. He has forwarded a petition against the charges—organised by students at New College, Edinburgh University—to Health Minister Dr. Gerard Vaughan."</p></blockquote>
It will come as some relief to the Minister that it is not he on this occasion who is receiving this petition. The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>" Many overseas students were already in serious financial hardship as a result of the sharp increase in fees which the Government had brought about",</p></blockquote>
and it goes on to deal with the petition being submitted by New College theological students who said that the charges, which are to apply from the beginning of October, cause particular offence. They say:
<br><blockquote><p>" We believe that they can only lead to division and seriously harm relations between overseas students and the people of this country."</p></blockquote>
That raises several questions for the Minister. First of all, he has to say whether he has any sympathy with the views expressed by the New College theological students. I believe that faculty to be in touch with the Third world. It knows what the impact of the Government's policy will mean for those students. If they are making the kind of observation which has been the subject of a protest by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central, we must know whether the Minister responsible for health services in Scotland is his own man, or whether he is being dragged along by the Minister of Health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member aware that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health has set up a working party to consider this problem and has said that he will make no decision about charges for overseas students until the working party has completed its operation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether the Minister of Health has taken that step does not remove from the Minister responsible for the Health Service in Scotland the responsibility to give his views. This is a matter in which devolution is already a fact, and members on this side of the Committee want to know his views. I hope the Minister will feel able to answer the question.<br><br>
Does the Minister not agree that if we were to have such a situation it would amount to a disgrace? Would he not accept that he should seek to persuade the Minister of Health, for the United Kingdom as a whole, to take a different course of action, and will he undertake to adopt a different attitude in Scotland? Those are important questions. There is much interest in the matter by universities and the church, and it would be interesting to know exactly where the Minister stands.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
Another matter which is also disgraceful in its own way concerns the Strathclyde scanner and the campaign taking place to introduce it. Our interest in this matter is, to some extent, promoted by the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), walked 10 miles in a sponsored walk in support of the campaign. He was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). One has to start an athletics career somewhere.<br><br>
That, I suppose, is the basis of our interest in the matter, but there is a serious point to be made. The Lanarkshire health board is reported in <i>The Scotsman</i> of 1 June 1981 as being
<br><blockquote><p>"angry over a letter from the Scottish Home and Health Department stating that the Government cannot pay anything towards the running or maintenance cost of a £750,000 scanner being bought with public donations.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>What particularly annoys the board is that the letter from the SHHD was unsolicited. At the moment, the public appeal to buy the scanner, organised by the Strathclyde Scanner Campaign, is about £150,000 short of its target."</p></blockquote>
What has to be answered is this. Is it normal practice for Government Departments to send unsolicited letters to health boards and tell them where they stand in regard to an issue which has never been raised with them? It seems slightly bureaucratic of the Scottish Home and Health Department to go to the bother of sending a letter to a health board saying that it cannot have the staff. Lanarkshire health board did not ask the Minister for staff, nor for support in this scheme. During discussions which I had had with the board some time ago, albeit during the period in office of the previous chairman, I undertsood that the commitment that the board had made was that if the public raised the money for the scanner—those who represent Strathclyde constituencies have all been involved in helping to raise the money—the board would provide the backup, but it could not meet the capital outlay. That seemed an eminently sensible arrangement which we could support. But, that notwitstanding, the Minister's Department told the board that it would " not be on " for it to go to the Government for money. That letter was completely unsolicited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.James Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bothwell)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a trustee of the scanner fund I was told by the Minister, in reply to a question, that the money would have to come from the board's own resources and that nothing would be forthcoming from the Government. I am happy to tell the Committee that we expect to reach the target figure by the end of the year, no thanks, to this Government; it has all been done by voluntary contributions, and the Lanarkshire board itself will be required to fund it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a most helpful intervention which confirms the Government's attitude. It would have surprised my hon. Friend and me if the Government had sent letters to the scanner campaign and the health board saying that they were prepared to give some money. That would have astonished us all and we should not be making this point today. But the Government wrote to the health board saying that it could not have any money when the board had not asked for any in the first place. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
hope that the Minister will tell his officials to play it a little more coolly and not upset those who are working hard to improve the quality of the service by raising money for an important piece of medical machinery. I hope that we shall not have this attitude repeated with other health boards throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coatbridge and Airdrie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I could say something that would help my hon. Friend. As one who organised collections for the scanner within industries in my constituency, I took the trouble to write to the Secretary of State for Scotland. I pointed out that this vast sum of money was being raised by public funds and that, if he was unable to guarantee it, could he at least give a voluntary contribution. He replied saying that he was unable to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that Her Majesty's Government have never been noted for their charity. No doubt my hon. Friend is able to live with the situation that has arisen. I am quite sure that he did not expect any other answer from the present Administration.<br><br>
I wish to move quickly, because time is moving on, to the structure of the Health Service. Hon. Members will be aware that there are 15 health boards. Five have no districts, and the remainder have 29 districts between them. Only the boards have a statutory basis; the districts were set up by administrative action of the boards, approved by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The Minister appears less than enthusiastic about the local health councils. I hope that he will tell us whether he has reached a clear view of their future.<br><br>
As regards staffing in the Health Service, I hope that the Minister will say that he has informed his right hon. and hon. Friends that he considers the 6 per cent, pay offer to nurses as disgraceful. I hope that he will fight within the Government for the nursing profession, because morale is very poor and there is a lack of confidence in the Government. That lack of confidence emanates from the fact that the Government are not really committed to the Health Service. They are much fonder of talking about private medicine and the extension of the private area in medicine. I hope that we shall hear today that there has at least been some change of mind with regard to nurses' pay.<br><br>
Another worrying feature of the present nursing situation is that we do not appear to be having the increase in staffing that is so vital to the service. I refer the Minister to parliamentary question No. 82 of 26 January 1981. If the hon. Member examines the figures published there and relates them to the hours and the reduction in hours which has taken place in the nursing profession, he will see that the numbers employed in the profession are different from those stated. At the same time, there is a reduction in the number of ancillary staff in the health service. All that contributes to a decline in morale.<br><br>
I do not believe that the normal rules of productivity can be applied to the National Health Service.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
I hope that the Minister will say that he will take positive action about the staffing levels and about Pay.<br><br>
One further matter of morale, which has concerned several Opposition hon. Members, relates to Woodilee hospital. On 17 December 1980, the Secretary of State for Scotland replied to a parliamentary question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Campbell). It dealt with events which came to be known as the Harkins case. At that time, the Secretary of State made recommendations to health boards and gave a long and detailed reply to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
However, the staff at Woodilee hospital are unable to identify any change. The circumstances are the same as they were at the time of the Harkins case. There is concern that we may be faced with further serious events. I am sure that the Minister, in common with everyone else in the building, does not wish that to happen. I hope that today he will say that something positive will be done.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and I hope to have a meeting with the Secretary of State for Scotland. I wrote to him in that respect and, although he acknowledged my letter, 1 have not yet received a reply. That meeting is of urgent importance. As I said, the staff are unable to identify any change and such worrying circumstances cannot continue.<br><br>
Moreover, we are also concerned about the availability of hospital beds. On 17 June, in reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled, the Minister said that those figures were not available. But information was available because the Minister had written to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). In an oral reply to my hon. Friend, the Minister said that 296 beds were out of use for financial reasons.<br><br>
I added up the number of beds referred to in the Minister's letter of 18 February 1981, and the total came to 362. The number is either 296, as the Minister told the House, or 362, as he told my hon. Friend. He has got his sums wrong somewhere. I hope that he will clarify the issue. It is unsatisfactory to us and to the country that so many beds should be out of action for financial reasons.<br><br>
Furthermore, we are also concerned about the cuts in health education and cuts in the health education unit which now undertakes only 75 per cent, of its advertising capacity. That is extremely worrying when one considers the importance of preventive medicine, not least in relation to alcoholism and heart disease and so on, and in the uptake of immunisation against diphtheria, whooping cough and so on. Will the Minister say just what the uptake is on immunisation?<br><br>
All that relates directly to the functions of the Scottish health education unit. I hope that we shall be told exactly what is going on. Many questions require a clear answer from the Minister. He must answer the charge that staff morale is low. He must clarify the position in respect of hospital facilities, closed wards and unused beds. He must answer the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
charge that the priority given to spending is presently being met by responsible local authorities. He must tell us what he is doing to combat the killer diseases so prevalent in Scotland, such as heart disease and bronchitis, and what he is doing to fight the scourge of alcoholism which is such a serious problem for us in Scotland. He must say what is to happen at Woodilee hospital, and clarify the steps being taken to prevent a repetition of the horrendous events which occurred there recently.<br><br>
I said at the outset that the Opposition believed in a comprehensive National Health Service, which should be paid for out of taxation, and be free for those who use it. Our aim is to achieve a growth in the National Health Service budget throughout the United Kingdom of at least 3 per cent, a year in real terms, and to devote a higher proportion of the nation's wealth to meet the pressing needs of the Health Service and personal social service. We also aim to abolish progressively all charges in the National Health Service.<br><br>
The health priorities of the Opposition were set out in evidence given to the Royal Commission which included a new shift from hospital treatment to care in the community. Greater emphasis was placed on the prevention of illness and handicap, a reduction in the level of infant mortality, a fairer share-out of health funds across the country, a better deal for the elderly, mentally ill and handicapped, greater encouragement and reward for those whose only professional commitment is to the National Health Service, better training and opportunities for nurses, and an improved career structure for hospital doctors.<br><br>
Finally, the next Labour Government will separate private practice from the NHS hospitals within the lifetime of the next Parliament, and ensure that private hospital developments do not expand to an extent that will damage the interests of the NHS.</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), after hearing what I understand to be his first Front Bench speech. It was made very responsibly, if one considers some of the horrific things that are said by hon. Members to the media about the National Health Service. I compliment the hon. Gentleman, and wish him many more returns to the important position that he has held this morning.<br><br>
The Opposition are well aware that the best way to fuel a crisis is to claim its existence. The fact that it is purely imaginary is no drawback. That may be helpful because, like kites and balloons, hon. Members fly highest when they are not weighted down by facts. There is no finer target for scare-mongering than the NHS. Ever since 1948, headlines have appeared every now and again which read " Crisis in the Health Service." Such headlines have appeared under both Conservative and Labour Governments.<br><br>
The National Health Service is not a single working unit, as hon. Members know, but a gathering together of different disciplines, skills and sciences
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
into a caring service. Given such a structure, it is inevitable that each specialty should seek to advance its own claims for resources. Regrettably, it is also inevitable that the squabbles which often follow such claims should be seized on by the media, and blown up out of all proportion. Recently, a page was dedicated, unfortunately, to the " Crisis in the Scottish Health Service ". After all, it is easier for a cunning journalist to put in a headline such as that than one which announces a steady, but small and slightly unspectacular growth in the NHS. One is good copy, and the other is poor copy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'> (Aberdeen, North): Surely the Minister will accept that it is the duty of any responsible journalist to tell the truth, and not to manufacture headlines to suit the Government of the day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave that to hon. Members. It is easy to have a headline if someone produces spurious facts to go underneath it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>(West Stirlingshire): Name some of the spurious facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be inevitable, but none the less unfortunate, that Opposition Members then jumped on such a bandwagon, rather like the revolutionary wives on the steps of the guillotine. Such irresponsible and continual prophecies of doom leave the poor old public wondering whether the service is really dying. In fact, it remains very healthy—fit for life, it might be said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government believe that health is too important to be left to private individuals, that extensive organised private medicine has no place in the Health Service, and that health care should be administered and financed entirely by the National Health Service— and provided free at the time of use?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that the National Health Service—to which we have a duty—can and will remain, but that a private health service is complementary to it. We have no objection to private health care for those who wish it.<br><br>
Let me now mention a matter which came up in last week's points of order. I am very willing to continue giving way, but it takes time from other hon. Members who wish to speak. If all day were available, I should be happy to follow up all the points made by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). But we have only until one o'clock, and I am anxious that hon. Members should be allowed as much of that time as possible. However, I shall try to answer some of the points which the hon. Gentleman made at the beginning of his speech.<br><br>
I must remind the hon. Gentleman that this is a health Estimates debate. He spent rather a long time discussing the social services. Personal social services are a grey area, which we are considering with support financing. However, as well as the extra money which we are spending on health, we are spending more year by year on personal social services.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
As for the hon. Gentleman's question about overseas students—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denipsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the subject of health, I should like to make a few small points. It is the first time that I have intervened in a Minister's speech.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister a question about Health Service spending. Could not something be done to find extra money, along with staff, to bring into use 83 empty beds in the Monklands hospital? The hospital has a full complement of 600 beds, 83 of which are still not in use. I have written to the Minister about the matter, but I should like to know whether he can make any suggestions for returning the hospital to full operation in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch on the general issue of hospital beds, but I shall certainly also consider the specific example given by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I was very pleased to give way to the hon. Gentleman. As he said, it is the first time that he has asked me, in my ministerial capacity, to do so. But interventions have taken up as much time as I have spent speaking, and we have not yet made much progress. I ask hon. Members to show some consideration on the matter.<br><br>
As regards overseas students, we have been given some information by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). My hon. Friend's knowledge of Government policy is always up to date, and he was right in saying that on 30 June the Government announced a delay in the implementation of their proposals, and the establishment of a working party.<br><br>
On charges, there is no case for a separate arrangement in Scotland. Although we are devolved in Scotland, I do not believe that charges should be imposed for students in England and not in Scotland. That must be a matter for the United Kingdom, as hon. Members on the Opposition Benches will surely appreciate.<br><br>
In considering the Strathclyde scanner, we may enter areas of emotion. It is laudible that people should group together and produce the money for such equipment from their own resources. However. I must make the point that if that were done throughout Scotland, the Health Service would not be able to provide funds on so massive a scale. So far, we have been fortunate. The necessary finance exists, and I hope that the Strathclyde scanner will be operating as soon as possible.<br><br>
I was asked to give a specific assurance about the future of health councils. I cannot do better than repeat what my right hon. Friend said—namely, that we shall consider the future of health councils in due course.<br><br>
However, I must tell the Opposition that it does not help us to consider the future of health councils when the time of Edinburgh health councillors is employed in distributing such leaflets as the STUC's " Medicine before Missiles", with a rather nasty cartoon. If hon. Gentlemen have finished their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
ribaldry, I shall point out that it is not a health council's job to peddle political policies, which is what this leaflet is. Then there are " Help Yourself to Better Health ", " Defend the NHS " and "Save Your Health Service ". They are political propaganda and have little to do with health. It does not help us to take a good view of health councils if they spend their time and taxpayers' money in distributing such propaganda.<br><br>
I shall come to nurses' pay and staffing later. On the question of Woodilee hospital, my right hon. Friend intends to reply to the hon. Gentleman within the next few days; a meeting will be arranged.<br><br>
I come now to the question of beds. As I have tried to explain, we do not keep a record of all the reasons why beds are out of commission. But we certainly know the number out of action for financial reasons at any given time, and I gave it to the Committee. However, there is a variety of other reasons—for example, the redecoration of wards, or a bed might be broken. Finance is only one reason for their not being used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not my hon. Friend agree that there are even more serious and worrying shortages of surgical facilities? That is particularly true of cardio-surgery in Edinburgh, where there is a waiting list of about 200. So far this year, 43 people have had to come to England for their surgery. That is not the fault of my hon. Friend's Department, but because of the unbelievable delay by the Lothian health board, which has taken five years to come up with a proposal for putting the matter right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I accept that there is that problem of implementing the Kay report in the East of Scotland. But we are constantly monitoring the matter. There has been a delay because of some disagreement among specialists about how to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As an outsider, I hope that the Minister will not object to my intervening on a point about Lothian. I had the impression from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) that he was suggesting negligence—or at least obstruction—by the health board in providing facilities. Does the Minister endorse that view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Possibly there has been some delay. Whether there has been obstruction, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) implied, is another matter. That is all I wish to say about the issue at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that I was not suggesting negligence on the board's part. But I understand that a number of options have been put forward, and the board seems unable to make up its mind about them. Would my hon. Friend consider setting up a separate assessment of the best answer to what is a desperate problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall certainly consider that point.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be defending the Lothian health board against the accusations of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was not attacking the Lothian health board. He made that perfectly clear.<br><br>
I should like to conclude my reply to the points made by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). In spite of what he said about health education, expenditure in real terms has risen by over 50 per cent, since 1977-78.<br><br>
I must now turn to my main theme. I would like to say something first about the policies and priorities that we should be following in the Health Service now in the years ahead; secondly, about some changes that are taking place in the organisation which is providing health services; and thirdly, about the resources which that organisation has available to it.<br><br>
First, I shall deal with policies and priorities. My right hon. Friend and I were glad to receive last year from the Scottish Health Service planning council a comprehensive report entitled " Scottish Health Authorities—Priorities for the Eighties". That report, which has become known as SHAPE, is on the table in the Committee Room, and hon. Members may well have read it. It is a thorough and comprehensive review of the whole situation, and we are most grateful to the council's chairman, Professor McGirr, for presenting it to us. It was published in December. My right hon. Friend accepted its recommendations and said that he was asking health boards and the Common Services Agency to make their allocations of resources in the light of the assessment of relative priorities set out in the report.<br><br>
What is the main burden of the report? It is concerned with priorities as between one part of the service and another. After reviewing the needs of various groups of people requiring health care, the report divides the various services into three categories of priority, category A having the greatest priority and category C the least. Within category A are preventive services including health education, services for the multiply deprived, services for the elderly—especially the elderly with mental disability—and services for the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the physically handicapped. Those are the services to which the planning council thought, and my right hon. Friend agreed, that the main priority should be given. Lesser priority should be given to services such as dental and ophthalmic services. Acute hospital services are in the relatively low priority of category C.<br><br>
Hon. Members may wonder why acute services are in the lower category. I shall say a word about that policy before it is misunderstood or misrepresented. It is, after all, the acute services to which everyone turns when there is a sudden onset of serious illness. Such services often involve expensive equipment and special skills which attract public interest and attention. The report, it should be understood, does not recommend that less should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
be spent on those services, although it leaves open the possibility that there may be some reduction in some places. The report is concerned with priorities. In view of the need to extend and improve services for groups requiring long-term care, such as the elderly, the planning council did not think that acute services need have as much priority as they have had in the past. One of the reasons why it should be possible to maintain a high standard of acute services without increasing expenditure is that, with improving medical techniques and more efficient organisation, we can use the same number of beds to treat more patients—in the jargon, we can increase the through-put. Putting the point another way, the same number of patients can be treated in a smaller number of beds.<br><br>
The whole question of how best to use hospital beds is a matter primarily for doctors and nurses. But it is important to look radically at existing practices, and to make generally available the experience of those who have been able to introduce effective new arrangements. This is such an important field that the planning council, in association with my Department, has mounted a further exercise specifically about how best to make use of these beds. We look forward to getting a report in due course.<br><br>
As I mentioned earlier under the heading of health education, my right hon. Friend put prevention at the top of his list of priorities in SHAPE. Prevention and health education are subjects which have been of particular concern to me since I took office. It is obviously better not to be ill than to have one's disabilities reduced or even to be cured completely. It is absurd that we should devote so much time, effort and money to attempting, not always successfully, to cure people of illnesses which they have brought upon themselves. I know that constant references to smoking can be a bore, but they are nonetheless true. As I have said elsewhere, about 5,000 people die prematurely each year in Scotland because of illnesses related to cigarette smoking. In other words, if I may be blunt, they brought upon themselves illnesses that those of us who have been in the Services may describe as self-inflicted wounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend help me by subdividing that figure? If he cannot do so now perhaps he could answer my question when he winds up the debate. Can he tell us whether there are any statistics about what are called passive smokers—those who, like myself, do not smoke but have to inhale other people's smoke? Is there any evidence that that has a damaging effect on the health of non-smokers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give my hon. Friend actual figures, but there is certainly evidence now that damage is done to those whom he calls passive smokers.<br><br>
In order to intensify our health education effort in Scotland, I arranged for the establishment of a new health education co-ordinating committee which brings together all those with responsibilities in that sphere—that is, the Department, health boards, education authorities, voluntary bodies, and, of course,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
the Scottish Health Education Group, which is the main central body responsible for the health education effort. I was glad to be present at its first meeting in March; and I am sure that under the able, and indeed dynamic, chairmanship of Sir John Crofton, a former president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, it will produce a more intense co-ordinated health education effort in Scotland as a whole.<br><br>
I come to my second main theme—the general organisation responsible for providing health services in Scotland. As the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East, pointed out, we have 15 health boards of varying size and responsibility related to the circumstances of different parts of the country. Ten of these boards divide their areas into districts, each district having a district executive group of officers from the main disciplines. The various hospitals and other units report to these district executive groups. Thus there are in these areas three levels in the administrative hierarchy. It seemed to my right hon. Friend and me that in most areas in Scotland it should be possible to dispense with the districts, thus eliminating one level in the hierarchy, improving the decision-making process and giving additional responsibility to the people at the local level. We issued in 1979 our consultative document on " The Structure and Management of the NHS in Scotland " and there has been a good deal of consideration of the issues since then.<br><br>
The current position is that, as announced by my right hon. Friend in the House on 12th March of this year, three health boards have decided to get rid of districts. The other seven with districts at present see considerable difficulties in abolishing these districts. All seven have, however, accepted that further consideration should be given to their management arrangements, bearing in mind the Secretary of State's aim that districts should be abolished where-ever possible and that the responsibility of managers at unit level should be increased. Since my right hon. Friend made that statement, I have met the chairmen of all 10 health boards with districts and discussed the situation generally with them. The seven not yet committed to abolishing districts are reviewing the situation, and I hope that as a result of these reviews there will be at least a substantial slimming down of administrative arrangements.<br><br>
May I emphasise to the Committee, as I have to the chairmen, that the decision about the administrative structure is for the health boards themselves. Scotland is not a very big country, but it is a very diverse country; and we do not take the view that it is for Ministers in St. Andrew's House to say exactly how the service will be organised in the very different circumstances of, say Glasgow on the one hand and the Highlands on the other. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I think that the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), who is interrupting from a sedentary position, will know that the position was exactly the same under the Administration of which he was a member. The health boards are encouraged by St. Andrew's House to get on with running their own affairs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
The current consideration of new arrangements is, of course, taking place in full consultation with staff interests at local level; and the Whitley councils at national level are considering all the implications for pay and conditions of service.<br><br>
My third theme concerns resources; and here we find an astonishing phenomenon. The Secretary of State and I have repeatedly said, and indeed, have repeatedly demonstrated, that resources for the Health Service in Scotland have not been cut and are not proposed to be cut. We have given figures to show exactly what has happened. None the less, some newspapers, some organisations and some individuals still refer to cuts in the Health Service. Indeed, only a few days ago we received from the Scottish Trades Union Congress a resolution passed in April which
<br><blockquote><p>" deplores and condemns the decision of the Tory Government who, with callous indifference to the needs of the vast majority of working class people, savagely cut expenditure to the National Health Service."</p></blockquote>
That sort of fabrication is irresponsible and does no good at all. The National Health Service, which was started in 1948, has grown under Governments of both parties. To suggest that there is a vast difference in the NHS today from what existed in 1978-79 is utterly ridiculous. If the resolution is correct today, it was correct under the previous Administration, but somehow we did not get it then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the proof of the pudding to which my hon. Friend refers the fact that during the period under this Government's control the NHS has actually increased the number of nurses by some thousands and doctors by some hundreds? Is not that much more likely to prove my hon. Friend's point than the ignorant noises that we have just heard from the other side of the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend says is absolutely right. Before I finish, I shall give the Committee the increases in numbers of doctors and nurses since this Administration took office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Before the Minister leaves the issue of the Government's expenditure on the Health Service, could he tell us whether the figure that he is working from include the element of local authority expenditure which was included in the White Paper, or whether the figure is purely the amount spent by the Government? That is a most important aspect. Can he also say where the growth has come from? Is it from the local authority element of the Health Service—personal social services—or from the Government's Health Service expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present I am speaking only of Government expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May we have the figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I risk repeating myself yet again on the question of cuts and getting a small headline as the " no cuts " Minister. Again at the risk of repeating myself, I give the Committee the facts. In our manifesto, we said that it was not our intention to reduce spending on the Health Service. We have, in fact, substantially increased it. In 1978–79,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
the last year of the Labour Administration, £617 million was allocated to health boards in Scotland. In 1981-82, they are to receive £1,067 million. Since 1978-79 we have provided fully for the effects of inflation and have also provided an increase in real terms of just over 3 per cent. So again I nail the lie about cuts in NHS spending. In other words, we have made available this year in real terms 3 per cent, more than the Labour Government made available in their last year in office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Gentleman will accept that under the SHARE agreement the position can be extremely difficult for authorities such as Tayside Health Board. It has given up a proportion of its revenue, and is faced with a situation where at least no cuts shows a minimal growth situation but which, in effect, because of a need for at least 1 per cent, growth a year to keep pace with events and make changes, requires making cuts in some sectors of the Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I had intended to refer to that. I thank the hon. Gentleman for mentioning it, because it is important.>lb/>
I was about to say that, granted all the present economic difficulties which face the country and the restrictions which have had to be made in various sectors, surely no one can deny that this increase is a considerable achievement. Looking to the future, we have indicated in our published plans that we will increase gross expenditure on the National Health Service by about 7-7 per cent, in real terms between 1980-81 and 1983–84.<br><br>
I should emphasise, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) pointed out, that these growth figures apply to Scotland as a whole. He was right in saying that, because of the operation of the SHARE report, some boards have more-than-aver-age growth, some less. In fact, the 1| per cent, for each of the years that I mentioned works out at just over 3 per cent, for the top board and very little for the board getting the least.<br><br>
I am well aware, too, that this provision for growth does not mean that boards do not sometimes have problems in finding sufficient funds to bring into operation new developments of various kinds. When, for example, the building of major new units is completed, the operation of these units may present difficulties unless savings are found elsewhere. All this involves difficult decisions, and the Secretary of State and I are most grateful to members of boards for the responsible way in which they approach these decisions. The community generally, whether it knows it or not, also has reason to be grateful to those board members for all the work that they do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman state what percentage increase is required in the Health Service to stand still, particularly in view of the fact that health care is developing in such a way as to become much more expensive with the technological advances that have been made? It is not sufficient
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
to say that more money is being spent; it is also important to see that advances continue to be made and that we do not slip back in the world in our provision of health services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that hon. Gentlemen take an unfair advantage of time to make speeches by way of intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes a fair point. To stand still costs nearly 1 per cent. However, the additional resources that have been made available have made it possible not only to finance various important medical developments but to employ additional doctors and nurses. Again, I want to get these figures on the record.<br><br>
In the first 18 months of this Administration, the number of doctors in hospitals increased by 139 and the number of nurses by 2,562.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. I am surprised—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised. I am giving the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the Minister becomes hysterical, may I say that in his own reply on 26 January 1981—these are the figures that he is quoting to the Committee—he adds the note that part of the increase
<br><blockquote><p>"will be only an apparent one: because of the reduction in the working week from 40 to 374- hours"—<i>[Official Report,</i> 26 January 1981; Vol. 997, c. 294.]</p></blockquote>
So it is the Minister himself who is telling us that the increase he quotes is not a real increase—that it is only an apparent increase. I did not add that note; he did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It is not an apparent increase to the patients who benefit from these extra nurses. I am far from suggesting that there are no problems as regards availability of qualified staff. That increase in the number of nurses, for example, is very welcome. In certain areas, such as mental health and mental deficiency, there are still local shortages which I do not want to minimise, but I emphasise that we are making money available for the recruitment of staff and I am sure that everyone hopes that sufficient staff will be attracted to the areas in which there is a continuing need for reinforcement.<br><br>
Genuine improvements in the NHS would, of course, be at risk if pay increases for existing staff absorbed all the resources earmarked for development of the service. I therefore find it an encouraging sign of realism that important groups of staff —from ancillaries to hospital consultants—have settled in this round for increases which can be contained within the 6 per cent, pay factor.<br><br>
There is a great deal more that I could say about many aspects of the general Health Service policy but, as I have already indicated, I should like to leave time to hon. Members on both Benches. I shall be very glad and interested to hear what they have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call hon. Members to speak, I must point out that we have about 61 minutes left for a number of Back Benchers to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
speak, so if we apply the logic of fair shares for all, we may get them in.</span></p>
<p>11.29 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It did my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) little good this morning to put forward his case in " such a responsible way ". As I listened to the Minister. I began to realise that he must have written his own speech this morning, and probably in the small hours. No civil servant could possibly have prepared such a brief—certainly none with any career prospects.<br><br>
It seems to me that the provisions for chronic disorders will make one of the greatest calls on National Health Service resources in the foreseeable future. It is astounding that there is little or no reference to the problems associated with rheumatism and arthritis in the document " Scottish Health Authorities—Priorities for the Eighties".<br><br>
I have taken up that matter with the Minister on a number of occasions. I find it surprising that parliamentary answers should cost £30 because the last reply that I had from the Minister was not worth twopence. The Minister should read the report recently produced by the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council, which is a slamming indictment of National Health Service provision for the rheumatology services in the West of Scotland. The council points out that anyone living in the West of Scotland is 10 times less likely to see a consultant than anyone living in other parts of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
A generation ago, the disgrace of Clydeside was the prevalence of tuberculosis. The mass X-ray campaign, improved housing and better GP facilities have done much in a generation to eradicate that problem. Today, the major problem, in terms of the number of working days lost in Scotland, must be that of rheumatism and arthritis. Those disorders have become almost the scourge of the West of Scotland. Many working days are lost through complaints associated with them. The Minister must know the effects that they can have on family and industrial life and the ultimate cost to the NHS in hospital care, especially for the elderly.<br><br>
Astonishingly, there appears to be no shortage of recruits. The potential is there. The real problem is that the Minister does not allow sufficient flexibility and resource to the area health boards. The boards are just not advertising posts. That will eventually throw up much more public expenditure cost. The Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, for example is in my constituency—hence my special interest—and, as I understand it, it now takes about nine weeks from the time the GP refers a case to the time the patient can obtain an appointment at the Baird Street clinic. The aim should be to reduce that time lag to about four weeks.<br><br>
Moreover, there is the vexed issue of hip replacements. I understand that it may take one to two years from referral to treatment. If one wishes to have that done through private medicine, the facilities are more readily available, but it will cost £1,500 or £2,000. That is not an option available for most people.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
It is high time that the Minister visited the Baird Street clinic. I do not suggest that that is the only centre in the West of Scotland—or in the whole of Scotland—for rheumatism and arthritis, but the Minister would see for himself the work that is done there. The centre opened in 1965 and it handles about 1,000 patients a month. It is also has some bed provision for people travelling from Fort William or Cumbernauld to the centre.<br><br>
I should like from the Minister, apart from the assurance that he will pay an early visit to the Baird Street clinic, a firm undertaking that he will examine the case for a regional centre for mobility disorders in the West of Scotland. Such a centre would draw together existing services and, at the same time, develop as a centre of excellence for research, and make a major contribution to the mitigation of rheumatic and arthritic complaints.<br><br>
I was impressed by the fact that the United States Congress, in the 1960s, enacted legislation following a major commission of inquiry into rheumatism and arthritis. A series of arthritis centres were established in the United States to deal with research, treatment and education. As the Minister will know, there is an important need to stimulate awareness of the facilities available among general practitioners, especially if one considers the high proportion of patients who go to see their GP about such complaints.<br><br>
The City of Glasgow has two universities which could make a useful contribution here. There is a case for establishing such a centre in the city. That could be based on the facilities available, at the Baird Street clinic and at the Western Infirmary. The date for the eventual transfer of Baird Street clinic to phase 1 of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary building seems to be pushed further into the future. My anxiety is that, although the facilities that will eventually be available in the Royal Infirmary will be an improvement—</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that seventeen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seventeen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Craigen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the facilities that will eventually be available in the Royal Infirmary will be an improvement, the fact that the clinic is to move into the new infirmary should not submerge the contribution that can still be made.<br><br>
Rheumatism and arthritis, and the facilities that are available for primary and specialist care should be a priority in the document, especially because of the impact that that has on family and industrial life. I suggest to the Minister that there is a close correlation between some of the problems faced by unemployed people who have health problems, and the incidence of rheumatism and arthritis. That is also a problem disastrously affecting many young people, and I urge the Minister to take on board the need for the facilities to rank as a priority.<br><br>

I make no apology, Mr. Gourlay, for having concentrated solely on that one subject this morning. I hope that, by so doing, I shall get a reply from the Minister to the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p>11.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray and Nairn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I looked through my notes before the debate, I was intrigued to come across a small pile of papers headed " Speech not made in July 1980 ". I think that that speech would have been addressed to you, Mr. Gourlay. Two lessons flow from that: first, that what you were spared then will be inflicted upon you now and, secondly, that it is advisable for the Chairman to call a Back Bencher, otherwise that will merely increase the Back Bencher's determination to speak 12 months later.<br><br>
The second point that intrigued me was that, although times may change, it is clear that the problems that affect the Health Service remain. The points that I was anxious to make last year still require emphasis.<br><br>
I make one further preliminary observation. It has been apparent in our recent debates in the Scottish Grand Committee that an inordinate amount of time has been taken up by the Front Bench speeches. I and other hon. Members deprecate that and I hope that time will be found to allow greater expression of opinion by Back Benchers. I find it rather a waste of time to have an arid tossing of statistics backwards and forwards between the Front Benches. I feel that as the Scottish Grand Committee we want to address our minds to today's problems and to what we expect of today's Government in trying to find solutions. Against that background I shall make two points.<br><br>
The first was raised by the Minister, and relates to the structure and management of the National Health Service in Scotland. The Minister emphasised this morning the Government's determination to try to improve and simplify the process of decision making in the Health Service. He also made clear that one of the ways in which he sought to do this was by trying to abolish the existing district tier wherever possible.<br><br>
I do not pretend to speak for other parts of Scotland, but as regards my own constituency, I am in no doubt that the abolition of the Grampian health board West district is not possible if one is concerned about having a rational and sensible decision making process as a yardstick. Any other move would merely delegate the trivia of day-to-day management to less-qualified clerks at local level, and the result would be that the key decisions on medium range policy would inevitably be referred back to the board itself sitting in Aberdeen 80 miles away from the problem.<br><br>
The West district is comparatively compact. Its record shows that it has served the community well. Its administrative staff are recognised locally to be of high calibre and the lines of communication are well understood between the west district executive and the local GPs. The effect of all that is that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
field work is of a consistently high standard. It is a good example of local administration tailored to local needs.<br><br>
It has another key element to justify its retention. It can act as a check or a brake on the centralist approach to running local services which has no place in rural communities.<br><br>
The other check that is at present in existence, but also under threat, is the local health council. The Minister confirmed this morning that he intends to abolish at least some health councils. I accept that in some cases it may be sensible to do so. I can think of one in my constituency which did not even bother to report last year. It produced a report this year which barely justified the printing of covers to enclose it.<br><br>
On the other hand, the Moray local health council fully justifies its existence. It is a body composed of both voluntary and elected representatives. They, too, are highly respected in the community, and, on a number of problems such as maternity and geriatric provisions which the Minister is fully aware of, they have been able to articulate local fears and worries effectively and responsibly. In spite of that, the view made known of the Grampian health board was that it questioned the value of such a body, claiming that other voices could speak for the local community just as effectively.<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that such pronouncements betray more about the lack of awareness by the health board than about the inadequacy of the local health council. It would seem odd that while the local community thinks so well of the council, only the board should think so ill of it. It may be, of course, that the council is too effective at making life uncomfortable for the health board, and too troublesome in seeking information in advance of decisions being made. Nonetheless, it, too, is an important check on too rigid and centralist an approach.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Government might not consider giving additional powers, on the lines of the old management committees, to try to integrate the council even more fully in the local health effort.<br><br>
I should like to comment briefly on another aspect of great concern—the mentally handicapped. The Minister again touched on that subject. In health care there seems to be an increasing divide between the views of parents and those concerned locally with such problem families, and the thinking of the health boards.<br><br>
If I may particularise, the Grampian health board proposes to expand the Woodlands hospital in Aberdeen for the treatment of handicapped children in that area. The board has turned its face firmly against welcoming moves to provide a more local unit. It gives the impression of placing too much emphasis on the doctrine of centralised care and centralised career structures, rather than taking fully into account the views of the parents concerned.<br><br>
Last month in <i>The Press and Journal</i> an article was printed, headed " Rights of the ' Silent Minority ' ". It was written by the parent of a handicapped child in Forres, and said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
<br><blockquote><p>'"The silent minority"—</p></blockquote>
the mentally handicapped—
<br><blockquote><p>"cannot speak for themselves and many of the parents, exhausted and drained by their experiences, feel they dare not speak either lest they be seen to bite the hand that feeds them."</p></blockquote>
I hope I can be allowed to speak for them this morning.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that he made a recent speech, in which he urged the need for what he called " local drive " in improving facilities. He said that although
<br><blockquote><p>"what can be done from the centre will be done "</p></blockquote>
the scope was limited and that improvements would be brought about only by imaginative local initiatives. 1 have good news for the Minister because there is that local drive in Forres.<br><br>
On 20 June 1981, the local weekly paper, <i>The Northern Scot,</i> announced that a respite care scheme had been set up
<br><blockquote><p>"to provide short-term fostering—anything from a day to two weeks—for mentally handicapped children, which would give their families a break from the constant strain of looking after them, or provide emergency relief if a parent was ill or had to go into hospital."</p></blockquote>
The point I am trying to get across to the Minister is that the local will of which he speaks exists in that area. All it requires is the proper level of support by the boards. Here I should like to question one part of the Minister's speech. He emphasised the need to allow the health boards to work with the minimum interference from central Government. But is that really the only way in which a Government can look at such a problem? Have not our Government made clear the attitude of central Government to the sale of council houses and the attitude towards the needs in regard to rate support grants? Logically, if the health board is out of touch with the local community, the Government must assert their right to represent the best interests of that community. Otherwise, I fear not only alienation between the local community and the health board, which is answerable to the Secretary of State, but a further movement from rural areas into cities.<br><br>
It is sobering enough now to reflect on what disaffected elements in the cities have been doing in the past 48 hours. Let us not do anything that would discourage the retention of a full infrastructure in the rural areas and encourage a further drift into the cities, with an increase in their problems. In that spirit, I invite my hon. Friend the Minister to consider what I have said.</span></p>
<p>11.51 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. J. Dickson Mabon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) said about local health councils. I hope that the Minister's intemperate remark about propaganda will not blind him to the fact that many of us regard local health councils as extremely valuable—not only in the context of the argument put by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn but also in bringing pressure to bear to modify the behaviour of boards.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
I do not regard the Argyll and Clyde health board as the be-all and end-all or the fount of all wisdom about hospital administration in my area. The board makes mistakes. Who does not? I understand that the Minister has statutory power to direct health boards to rectify matters where in his opinion there are deficiencies. I could give an example, but I shall not labour the point as I wish to make a brief speech. I hope that the Minister will not simply gallop ahead and abolish local health councils for the reasons that he tried to advance this morning. Those councils have their place.<br><br>
In the Appropriation Accounts Volume 3, published in March, Sir Douglas Henley, the Comptroller and Auditor General, blamed the Government for mismanaging three Scottish hospitals—Inverclyde Royal, Aberdeen Royal and Monklands district general hospital. My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) referred to 77 unused beds. If my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) is called, no doubt he will refer to the 66 beds in Aberdeen Royal that lie unused for purely financial reasons. The Comptroller and Auditor General was wrong to say that there were 60 beds in Greenock—in fact, because there is no money, 76 beds lie empty there on floor J of a hospital conceived 20 years ago, which has taken all this time to commission, design and build. It is an absolute disgrace that lack of money should cause all these beds—in the intensive care unit, too— to lie empty.<br><br>
If my constituents could listen to the Minister this morning, they would be astounded at his utter complacency. I agree that it is pointless to bandy figures about—it is certainly pointless to those who are still on the waiting list. Despite the hard work involved, the report before us, compiled by all those eminent ladies and gentlemen, is nonsense in the eyes of ordinary peopie. The waiting lists are longer, although the hospitals are grander.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Waiting lists are shorter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No—may I finish? In my area we used to treat about 11,000 patients a year in all the beds in all the hospitals. With the new hospital we still treat only 11,000 patients a year, but we have been congratulated by the Secretary of State. His letter dated 29 June says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am aware that Inverclyde Royal hospital is treating about the same number of patients as were being treated by the hospitals it replaced, but with 107 fewer beds."</p></blockquote>
In other words, there is no such thing as a cold bed in Inverclyde Royal hospital. No sooner is one patient out than the next is put in. The Secretary of State congratulated the hospital on its remarkably efficient administrative performance in getting a higher ratio of patients to beds than other hospitals. Yet there are 76 beds unused, and the waiting lists for Inverclyde, although they cover only one-quarter of the Argyll and Clyde health board area, are as long as those for the other three-quarters of the area put together.<br><br>
I have heard the question bandied about by doctors—" What is a waiting list? " Indeed, civil servants have an unfortunate contempt for waiting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
lists. They believe them to be wrong, inaccurate, subjective, bolstered and boosted by doctors to secure more resources. It is sometimes called empire building—and civil servants certainly know about that. However, a man in a shipyard who perhaps needs a hernia repaired who cannot return to work, and who may have to wait one, two or even three years, knows all about waiting lists. It is most unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my honourable and qualified Friend for allowing this intervention. I agree wholeheartedly with what he said. But will he also take into consideration the fact that often it is the big white chiefs of the gown and scalpel who play footsie with the Government and health boards? If such people were to get together with the authorises, the waiting lists could be reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that, but waiting lists would not be reduced to the point of disappearance. I have constituents who have been on waiting lists for a very long time for so-called cold surgery. That is the way in which some people somewhat contemptuously refer to it as if waiting for a chronic condition to be cured were not terribly important, which is nonsense.<br><br>
The Health Service has done extremely well over the years since we in the Labour Party created it against the wish of the Conservatives, who voted against it so many times. Converted though they may be to the concept of trying to make the Health Service flourish—at least, they protest that they are—it is not good enough for them to speak about an increase of 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, when beds and units are out of commission.<br><br>
Sir Douglas Henly said that the Government have failed to make resources available for running costs to match new buildings as they are completed. What foolishness it is to build a huge hospital and then not use it all. I could understand that if a local need did not exist. What would be the point of nurses and doctors being idle when other parts of the country were crying out for them? But I know that that is not the case at Inverclyde, and I suggest that it is not so in Aberdeen or Monklands—and by the way, Paisley and Glasgow Royal are next.<br><br>
A succession of hospitals will be commissioned and opened throughout the country. I regret to say that many others will have to make the same point that I am making today. Because of the foolishness of the central Government, hospitals are being commissioned without the extra cash being provided. I have a ridiculous letter from the Secretary of State, which states that the board should either by banking or borrowing, be able to commission various elements. But under the SHARE formula my board has no chance of banking or borrowing to sustain the new units.<br><br>
Incidentally, having been a Minister, I know how the formulae are conceived. First, the answer is worked out, and then the formula is devised and imposed on others. Some bodies, such as the Argyll and Clyde health board, end up on the wrong side
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
of the counter. The formula must therefore be rephrased. I suggest that the SHARE formula is not fair for those areas of the country with high morbidity and large waiting lists.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) made an excellent speech about rheumatism and arthritis in the West of Scotland. The evidence that he adduced proves that morbidity patterns in Scotland vary. A SHARE formula that takes no account of morbidity is nonsense. Although I do not suppose that the Under-Secretary of State will actually do it, I greatly hope that he will get rid of the formula, have a new one and give those boards a chance. Above all, the Government should in the first or second year of commissioning a new hospifal give the board extra money specifically for the use of that hospital, by employing the statutory form of direction that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to take up the points made by the right hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon), save to say that the problem that new hospitals cost more than those they replace is one that is found throughout the United Kingdom. That problem has not just been found by the present Government; it was found by the Labour Government as well. It is a serious problem to which we shall have to address ourselves, not only for the hospitals that are built now but for future hospitals.<br><br>
I wish to divide my speech into two parts dealing first with what is a local issue but one that provides an example of a problem that I believe is fairly widespread throughout rural Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) and others have already mentioned similar problems although they are not the same as the one I wish to discuss.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister knows that I have been in correspondence about the problem with the Argyll and Clyde health board. Frankly, I have been most dissatisfied with the responses that I have received. I cannot share the opinions of the two hon. Members who spoke before me, but I am concerned about the role played by health boards and health councils vis-a-vis the public, the consumers. It seems to me that when the public have grievances about the National Health Service they approach their Member of Parliament as they do not appear to believe that they have any representation on the health boards or health councils. Perhaps that is because of the way in which they are composed, without direct election, constituencies of interest and so on.<br><br>
People have approached me with the problem of the maternity services about which I have had correspondence with the Argyll and Clyde health board. The maternity services in Oban have been provided for many years through the medium of the Glen Euchar GP unit, which has been very successful, and I believe that the majority of babies in North Lorn
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
—including two of my own—were born there. Problem births were taken to Glasgow and, latterly, to the Vale of Leven.<br><br>
Over many years, the proportions roughly worked out that over one-third of the births in the whole area were outwith the area—initially in Glasgow and more recently in the Vale of Leven—and two-thirds were in Oban. However, there has been a distinct policy change over the past few months, and now more and more mothers are being advised to have their confinements in the Vale of Leven. Indeed, all those mothers who are expecting their first babies are being " advised "—I put that word in inverted commas because I think that it is such strong advice that a mother would be reluctant to go against it—to have their first babies there. The result will be that the balance will change, one-third of the babies will be borne in Oban and two-thirds of them will be bom in the Vale of Leven.<br><br>
There is considerable concern among mothers and prospective mothers about that change, and I shall read briefly from a letter from one of my constituents who wrote about the Vale of Leven hospital:
<br><blockquote><p>" While this is an excellent hospital it means a journey of 80 miles. In winter the road is sometimes closed and in summer it is full of holiday traffic. Mothers have to travel in an ambulance during labour and are brought back again in an ambulance the day after the baby is born. Apart from the discomfort to the mother and baby, how much does all this cost?</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>" Childbirth is not 2n illness. It should be as natural and happy a time as possible. Mothers are very unhappy about the prospect of having to go so far away from their homes and families … We do not know any good reasons why suddently Oban maternity hospital is not a safe place to have a baby."</p></blockquote>
That is what concerns me most of all. The health board put out a statement. I do not wish to read extracts from it because of a lack of time, but I am sure that the Committee will accept from me that each paragraph reeked of the proposition that somehow safety would be improved in the Vale of Leven. Yet when I asked Mr. Ayling, the secretary of the Argyll and Clyde health board, if he would give figures for the Oban maternity hospital to prove that general impression in the statement previously put out, his letter of 2 July 1981 said:
<br><blockquote><p>" These figures are not broken down into smaller populations. Any special breakdown of these figures for the Oban area is unlikely to be helpful".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that it is. Most people have the distinct feeling that Oban has a very good record of safety and that there is no real reason on the grounds of safety for this quite amazing transfer of mothers to the hospital at the Vale of Leven.<br><br>
What concerns me is that the question of statistical evidence was introduced without there being any. I suspect that the fear was raised in the minds of prospective mothers to make them more amenable to the proposition that they should go to the Vale of Leven.<br><br>
The issue has been badly handled, I wrote a letter to my hon. Friend who, as he must, rightly passed it on to the board. I also wrote directly to the board, which wrote back to me. The board does not seem to have addressed itself at all to the considerable concern felt among ordinary people in North Lorn.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
In its statements, the board refers to pressure groups, which it somewhat dismisses. There may well be a pressure group, but if so it consists of those people most directly involved—young women who have had babies in Oban, intend to have some more, or who are about to have their first.<br><br>
I know that the matter is not the direct concern of my hon. Friend. However, I hope that he will take this message from me to the board—that it has a responsibility to react to public opinion and it should not dismiss worried mums or any other patients as being merely pressure groups to be countered. They should be taken into consideration.<br><br>
I was a little surprised that the Opposition chose this subject for debate. The Government have a very reasonable record on spending in the Health Service over the past two years. Indeed, taken against the background of our country's economic problems, we have a very good record.<br><br>
Let us examine total spending in the Health Service. In Great Britain, expenditure is now higher in real terms than in any of the years of the previous Labour Government, and the Government plan that it should go on rising. In the last year of the Labour Government, 1978-79, the allocation to health authorities was £617 million. The figure for 1981-82 is £1,064 million, which not only makes up for inflation but is an increase in real terms of 3 per cent.<br><br>
In 1979-80 to 1980-81, the total expenditure in the Scottish health service rose by 1·75 per cent. It will rise by a further 1·75 per cent, for the period 1980-81 to 1981-82. We should all like to spend more on the service. I believe that health care—especially with the advances in medical science—could take all the money that the country has, let alone can afford. There would still be other interesting things that we could probably do at great expense.<br><br>
In Great Britain, Labour Ministers reduced capital expenditure on hospitals and community health care from £552 million in 1974, when the Conservative Government left office, to £358 million in 1978–79, when we returned to office. That is a reduction of one-third. We halted that decline and have allowed for a small increase. For example, in Scotland in the current financial year, £59-3 million has been set aside for capital projects. That represents a growth in real terms of 5-5 per cent, over the previous year.<br><br>
Those expenditure increases can be seen in two key indicators. The first is staff. In Britain as a whole there are many more doctors, nurses and back-up staff. Scotland has played its part in those increases. As my hon. Friend mentioned, in the first 18 months under this Government, there have been 139 more doctors and 2,562 more nurses. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) questioned that. I am prepared to accept that there may well be a shortening of hours, as he suggested. However, let us compare the statistics of the increase in medical staff from 1975 to 1979—not merely over 18 months but during the years of the previous Labour Administration. If my arithmetic is correct, there was an increase in staff of 2,497. No matter how many caveats the hon. Gentleman wishes to enter, he must accept that the figure of 2,566—which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
is what the subtraction on the table says—in 18 months in the year 1979-80 is much better than 2,497 over most of the period of his party's Government.<br><br>
The second indicator is waiting lists, on which I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to comment. In England, the waiting lists rose by almost a quarter under the Labour Government. There is no point in the Opposition pretending that for their five years in office the Health Service was perfect and they spent all the money that they could on it. That is not true. At the end of their term in office, the waiting lists were up by approximately ¾ million to 752,000. By September 1980, we had cut the waiting lists in England by 111,000. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether the same applies in Scotland. If it does, will he give the Committee those figures? Perhaps he wishes to give them now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help my hon. Friend if I give those figures immediately. In Scotland the waiting list at 31 March 1979 was 76,000; at 30 September 1979 it was 70,970; at 31 March 1980 it was 69,000 and at 30 September 1980 it was 67,000. The figures are continually dropping because there are more nurses, more doctors and more money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not hear the Opposition saying " Hear, hear " or " Congratulations " to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to get some information about waiting lists, but I should be interested to know from the Minister whether there is now an increase, not a decrease, in waiting lists for urgent conditions—leaving out entirely the nonurgent cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, the Minister will answer that query in his own speech at the end of the debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said once again " It is not true". Every statistic with which he does not agree is " not true". He does not give another statistic. The figures that I have given, and those given by the Minister, contrast markedly with a recent article by Dr. Logan in the <i>Sunday Standard.</i> Dr. Logan manages either to ignore or to get absolutely wrong most of the statistics relevant to the Health Service in Scotland. His use of words such as "crisis" and "collapse" might say more about Dr. Logan's political party than it does about the National Health Service. What the newspaper did not tell us—I found out subsequently—is that Dr. Logan is the district medical officer in the Renfrew district. Perhaps his hysterical outburst against the Government has more to do with the fear that his job might be under pressure because the Government were not happy about it. [HON. MEMBERS: "Cheap".] Hon. Members opposite may say " cheap ", but I think it cheap for someone to write an article without saying what his background is, especially when he has a background such as Dr. Logan's—both politically and in the National Health Service—which was discovered only subsequently.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
I shall make one other point which nobody has mentioned—my hon. Friend may mention it at the end of our proceedings if he can—namely, dental care. I refer to paragraph 11.7 of the report, "Scottish Health Authorities—Priorities for the Eighties ", which is about the fluoridation of water supplies.<br><br>
There is no doubt in my mind that for years children's teeth in Scotland have had more caries than there need have been because of the way we have reacted to the pressure group against fluoridation. I have no doubt that I shall get a mailbag the like of which I have not seen since the abortion issue, but I am still convinced on the issue of fluoridation. It is quite remarkable that both this document and all the health authorities are absolutely in favour of fluoridation, yet the water authorities still drag their heels.<br><br>
I regard that as most unfortunate, and I ask my hon. Friend, if he has time today, or at some stage, to review the evidence that has been peddled against fluoridation. I am continually amazed by it. I always say to those who are opposed to it " If it is such a bad thing, are you campaigning to take fluoride out of the water supply in those areas in which it naturally occurs?" From all my discussions with dental and medical people, it seems that the evidence in favour of fluoridation is overwhelming. I ask my hon. Friend to put pressure on water authorities to carry out their statutory duty to accede to the request of the local health board if it asks for fluoridation.</span></p>
<p>12.14 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ever since taking office in May 1979, the Government have pursued a general policy of switching responsibility for paying for services from the taxpayers collectively to individual users. One can see it in housing, where the so-called tenant's charter was virtually just an exercise to reduce and eventually eliminate all subsidies for council houses. It applies to education, where the Government are clobbering the public sector while increasing provision for the private sector. It is even more brutal and callous in the sector we are now debating, the Health Service.<br><br>
The Tories have never liked the Health Service. They pay lip-service to it now, only because they know that it is the most popular social service in Britain and they dare not demolish it by open frontal assault. Instead, they seek to undermine it by various methods, of which, admittedly, they warned us in their pre-election document " The Right Approach ". That document gave us and the electorate adequate warning:
<br><blockquote><p>" There is no case for holding down prescription and other charges"—</p></blockquote>
and, my goodness, we have seen how that has been translated into practice. Prescription charges have increased fivefold, and I suspect that a further increase will come in the autumn.<br><br>
The Conservative Party said that private health service provision should be encouraged, and said:
<br><blockquote><p>" We see no reason for quantitative controls over the development of the private sector outside the National Health Service."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
The document also states that tax relief would be allowed for contributions to private schemes. That has now been effected.<br><br>
Since the election, the Government have translated their promises —or threats—into actual provision. The Minister will recall our lengthy discussions on the Health Services Bill, when the Government sought to encourage not only the provision of private practice but the use of National Health Service facilities for private practice. The Government have now indicated that they will take further action. They have produced policy discussion papers on the whole issue of how the Health Service is financed. 1 suspect that before the Government's term of office ends the method by which the service is financed—that is, 95 per cent, by direct taxation— will be replaced by the insurance principle. The Government will entirely revamp the very basis of the National Health Service.<br><br>
The arguments against the insurance principle were spelt out by the Royal Commission on the National Health Service. Paragraph 2.19 of the commission's report states:
<br><blockquote><p>" There are two important disadvantages which arise in most insurance-based schemes. First, there are groups in the community who are both bad health risks and too poor to pay high premiums. They include elderly people, child-rent, and the mentally and physically handicapped. Over 60 per cent, of NHS expenditure is currently accounted for by these groups, and nearly half of the community are exempted for one good reason or another from prescription charges, for example."</p></blockquote>
The very people whom the Health Service was designed to protect—the old, the disabled, the poor, the children—will not receive adequate insurance cover if the Government's proposals are implemented.<br><br>
The report continues that
<br><blockquote><p>" an insurance scheme which offered a range of benefits according to ability to pay would inevitably favour the wealthier members of society … The introduction of an insurance system would incorporate into the NHS a new principle, namely, that a different standard of health care under the NHS was available to those who chose to pay for it. Some may feel such a change to be desirable, but at least it should be clearly recognised for what it is."</p></blockquote>
What it is, basically, is the principle that people should receive health care according to their ability to pay for it, and not according to their needs. It should be clearly recognised for what it is—that one should get health service according to one's ability to pay for it and not according to one's needs. That is an undermining of the fundamental philosophy on which the Health Service was based. That is why, I suspect, the Tory Party has always been against it.<br><br>
The Minister and others have quoted selective figures that can prove anything. The Minister himself gave certain figures with reference to priorities, and he also referred to nuclear weapons. I want to put that in its context, because I think that these debates on health, housing or whatever increasingly come down to how we spend the wealth that is produced by the workers of this country.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
We had figures—I shall quote them to the Minister on the Public Accounts Committee about weapons being built by this country to be put into operation and which are now either launched or about to be launched. The Minister mentioned the £6,000 million that we shall spend on Trident. My God, what could we do with £6,000 million on education for our children and care for those suffering from ill-health? This is relatively small change compared with Trident. I shall put the figures on record. They were given to us confidentially, but the public ought to know them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have a lot to say and I am pressed for time.<br><br>
The "Ark Royal" has just been launched; we cannot afford to run it so we are going to sell it to Australia, 1 believe. The original estimate for building the " Ark Royal" was £236 million, but the adjusted estimate for that ship, for inflation and other reasons, rose from £236 to £300 million—for one ship. The original estimate for the " Illustrious"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. While hon. Members may refer to the general aspect of Government expenditure, it is not in order to itemise Estimates other than those which are before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just giving examples—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman was giving examples, but I have decided that he has given sufficient examples on a specific matter, so perhaps we may move on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The essence of these debates is how we spend the national wealth. The Minister made the point and quoted from a leaflet that had been produced by an NHS body which gave examples of priorities. I have given one example in the " Ark Royal "; I could give examples of submarines, frigates and the rest. The amount of money that we are spending on these weapons of potential death is out of all proportion to the amount that we are talking about for the protection of people's health.<br><br>
That is the only point I want to make, and if I get the opportunity this afternoon in the defence debate I shall make the same points. I think that they are very relevant to the matter we are discussing.<br><br>
I want now to refer to the Government's efforts to eliminate or reduce the Health Service and substitute private practice. It is not a very relevant problem in Scotland, but the size of it is not the matter for concern^it is the principle.<br><br>
There is an article in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> of 9 June entitled
<br><blockquote><p>" Scotland catches Harley Street virus ".</p></blockquote>
It states:
<br><blockquote><p>" Within the next year there is likely to be a proliferation of private consulting rooms on the Harley Street model, extensions to the present private clinics and even the beginnings of a new private hospital in Glasgow … A

number of other consultants are known to be interested in an arrangement to use NHS facilities privately, although no applications have yet been made. Cohse "—</p></blockquote>
that is the union that sponsored my election to the House, I am glad to say—
<br><blockquote><p>"is most concerned about any move to introduce private practice to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at York-hill in Glasgow."</p></blockquote>
I thought that we had enough evidence of private practice in the building of that hospital, let alone the use of private enterprise within it. The article goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>" 'Already wards are closed there because of the construction problems and there is a great shortage of beds, particularly for perinatal problems in an area where perinatal mortality is high ' ".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is possible that the battle for private beds within the NHS will be averted by the building of a new private hospital in Glasgow. Glasgow already has the largest number of private beds ... of any of the health boards, and a company called Uldext, said to represent 100 doctors, has already failed in negotiation with the district council to secure a council-owned site at Maryhill."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"BUPA's Nuffield McAlpin clinic plans to start building a nine-bed extension in August which will include a special care unit and a physiotherapy service. Their spokesman said there was no doubt that private medicine was going from strength to strength in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I hope that every trade union and every working-class organisation in Scotland will resist, with the utmost zeal, this hideous and indefensible development of private health services in Scotland. I leave that matter there, but I tell the Minister that, when we gain control at the next election, all this private health service provision will be—not stopped altogether; I do not think that is possible—but entirely divorced from the National Health Service and entirely financed by those who care to use it. There will be no connection whatever between that and the Health Service provision for ordinary people.<br><br>
I come now to nurses' pay. In other debates, I have described at length the disgraceful way in which successive Governments, and particularly Tory Governments, have treated our nurses. Just before the last election, the now Minister for Health, the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan), said that the nurses ought to be treated in the same generous way as firemen, the Armed Forces and policemen. One of the biggest betrayals by this Government has been the way in which they have reneged on that undertaking, which was given not only by the Minister for Health but by the Prime Minister herself.<br><br>
The Health Service today is running on exploited labour of the worst kind. The nurses are being asked, this very minute, to accept 6 per cent, on their salaries at a time when inflation is running at about 12 per cent. In other words, we are saying " Thank you very much. You are doing a marvellous job. Now take a savage cut in your standard of living." That is the vote of thanks that we give to the nursing profession. We are getting our Health Service on the cheap, at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
cost of exploiting not only young women and married women but also the nurses in the mental institutions, who are largely men.<br><br>
COHSE represents a large number of male nurses. How we get them to work at all in those institutions astounds me. Successive Governments have taken advantage of them and exploited them because they know—or have a shrewd suspicion—that they will not go on strike. That is absolutely obscene and indefensible.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State for Scotland will have the guts to go to the Cabinet and say " We cannot accept the continued exploitation of these dedicated people in the Health Service ". The Minister ought to say that he will fight, and that his right hon. Friend will fight in the Cabinet, for a fair return for these people, who I believe belong to the most popular profession in the country. The whole country would be unanimous in voting a substantial increase for every nurse—and ancillary worker, too— in the Health Service. The Minister hardly mentioned nurses' pay, but it is the crux of the matter, and we are entitled to a frank answer on it.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and important debate. The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said that he was surprised that the Opposition chose the subject. I must tell him that we deliberately chose it because of our deep concern about the Health Service in Scotland.<br><br>
Before coming to the main burden of my remarks, I make two points. First, I express my sympathy, and that of the whole Committee, to the Minister. We know that he is under some personal strain today, and we wish to express our sorrow at his sad loss. Second, I apologise to you, Mr. Gourlay, and to the Committee, for my intemperate outburst when the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), true to type, attacked one of his own local organisations. I should have known better after seeing the hon. Member in action for the past two years. I apologise to the Committee. I shall not deal with what the hon. Gentleman said, because I should have known better than to expect more of him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not intend to refer to the hon. Member again.<br><br>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) on his obvious concern about the Health Service and on the way in which he opened our debate, and I wish at the outset also to take up the concluding point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), when he spoke about nurses' pay. The Minister said in opening that the Government had no intention of giving nurses more than 6 per cent, and that they must stick within the cash limits. I agree with my hon. Friend. Both he and I were in Westminster Hall on the day of the nurses' demonstration, when the now Minister for Health took the platform and gave the nurses an unqualified guarantee that a new Conservative Government would give them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
adequate reward for their services to the nation. I remember the Minister for Health telling the nurses, to tumultuous applause, that the Tory Party considered that they were being badly underpaid and that all they needed to have adequate salaries was the election of a Tory Government. I doubt that any nurse will believe a similiar statement from a Tory Minister in future.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central spoke about private practice. I concur with and confirm what he said about the re-election of a Labour Government seeing the end, once and for all, of the ability of private practice to use Health Service facilities. It has now been revealed that not only is private practice using Health Service diagnostic facilities but it is also getting free use of the National Health Service blood transfusion service and the blood bank.<br><br>
In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), the Minister makes clear that he considers it proper practice for the private sector to use NHS diagnostic facilities and that blood given freely by the general public should be made freely available to the private practitioner. I must question that. It is my understanding that a blood donor gives blood in the belief that it will find its way into the National Health Service blood transfusion service.<br><br>
I am sure that many people will be surprised that the blood transfusion service and the blood bank are available free of charge to private practitioners. I am not suggesting that they should be deprived of the blood. What is surprising is that those services are made available to private practice without charge. Indeed, the services are being subsidised by the NHS, and I thought that the Conservative Party was against subsidies.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Argyll mentioned the statistics which I disputed. On the question of the capital resources being spent by the Government, there is a good reason for such dispute. It was not the present Government who committed themselves to those capital resources—the previous Labour Government committed this Government to spending the money. It was the previous Labour Government who started building the Paisley district general hospital in Inverness; it was the previous Labour Government who decided to keep the old folks' home open in Glencoe and to spend a substantial sum of money on its refurbishing.<br><br>
In fairness to the hon. Member, there is an important point here. I asked the Minister about the future capital building programme—not about the present capital building programme; not the capital building programme of the previous Labour Government on which the capital resources are now being spent. When I asked the Minister what the Government's plans were for the future capital building programme of the Health Service in Scotland, I received the answer that a capital steering group has been formed from representatives of health boards and the Minister's Department, with the following terms of reference:<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
<br><blockquote><p>" To guide the consideration of the health capital building programme in Scotland in the light of the existing stock, the needs of health boards, and the likely availability of finance; and to report."</p></blockquote>
I am suspicious about the reason for the steering group being set up. I am even more suspicious about the terms of reference. If I can read behind those terms of reference, I am absolutely convinced that, arising from the steering group and the report made to the Minister, there will be a drastic cut in the future hospital building programme.<br><br>
Therefore, the hospital building programme which the Minister now has is that which the Labour Government gave to him, and what we have not yet seen from the new Administration—I say " new ", but it is now over two years old—is the Minister's own plans for future hospital building. Are we to have further hospital building in the various areas of Scotland represented by hon. Members who have spoken in this debate? My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Douglas) is always present at these debates. In regard to the new Dunfermline and West Fife district general hospital there is an important aspect to the new proposal which I have just given to the Committee. So we have not yet seen the future capital building programme, and T would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.<br><br>
Capital building programmes and waiting lists are automatically linked. Here again, the hon. Member for Argyll was upset when I questioned the Minister's waiting list figures. The Minister gave me the figures in a parliamentary answer on Monday 18 May 1981. The figures he is now giving are not figures at 30 September each year, but at 31 March each year. On 30 September 1974, a few months after the Labour Government came to power, the rounded-up figure—I will not quote the exact figure —was 33,000. The figure in September 1980, a few months after the present Government came to power, rounded up to a figure of 40,000. I do not think from what the Minister said that there was any indication that the waiting list figures which he gave were back to the level to which the Labour Government brought them down. For instance, in 1975 they were down to 30,000. In 1976 they were down to 30,000 and remained fairly steady. But then, of course, we come to the Conservative Government's term when, on 30 September 1979, they were up to just over 41,000, and on 30 September 1980 they were still lingering dangerously near the 40,000 mark. The hon. Member for Argyll will, I am sure, accept that I disputed the figures with some justification. I am not being selective; I am using the Minister's own figures.<br><br>
The number of consultants and other medical staff employed in hospitals—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I complete this series of figures? In 1979, when the Labour Government left office, the combined number of consultants and other medical staff in hospitals was 5,234. In 1980 the number for 5,262. I accept that that is an increase, but an increase of only 28 in the first year. I accept, too, that the Minister's figures are more up to date than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1290">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
that. However, during the period from 1974 to which I referred—exactly the period cited by the hon. Member for Argyll—the pattern was one of constant increase in the numbers of consultants and other medical staff. I am surprised to hear the hon. Member for Argyll dealing in those figures when the picture was one of a consistent increase over several years. I accept that there has been an increase in the past year, too.<br><br>
I now come to the increase in the number of nurses. When I intervened during the Minister's speech, I said that it was he, not I, who added the note to the parliamentary answer that I received on 26 January saying that the increase was " only an apparent one ". I am not quoting out of context— those were his exact words. He described the 1980 figure—53,272— as " whole-time equivalent". What is a whole-time equivalent? Is it the person who gives the patient an injection or the person who brings the bottle or the bedpan? Why can the Minister not tell us exactly how many nurses are in the Health Service now and how many more we would need to bring into use the empty beds in the hospital in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon), and in other hospitals, in Aberdeen and other places where beds are out of use because of lack of money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not keen to give way, because the Minister and I have an arrangement and I do not wish to encroach on his time.<br><br>
I wish to deal quickly with three other matters. The first is the Minister's constant claim that the Government are spending more money on the health Service in Scotland. When we examine the figures in the White Paper on public expenditure we discover that the Government are not spending the money at all; the increase is wholly in the personal social services financed by regional social work departments.<br><br>
We should look at the outturn figures rather than the projected spending figures. It is easy to include high estimates in public expenditure surveys, but the actual outturn figures are a different matter. In every year in which the present Government have been responsible for such matters the outturn figure has been lower than that originally included in the public expenditure White Paper. In constant 1979 terms, in the financial year 1980-81, the Government spent only £1 million more on the Health Service than the Labour Government spent in 1974–75.<br><br>
The costs of the increase, if there is one, are being borne entirely by regional social work departments, and their budgets are the very part of public expenditure that the Secretary of State is now cutting dramatically.<br><br>
I agree entirely with what the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) said about reorganisation. One of the big problems in the Health Service is that since 1972–73 it has had far too much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
organisation. It ill becomes the present Government to castigate the present organisation now, because it is their organisation. A Conservative Government introduced the present Health Service structure. In a short time, the NHS has had to cope with that massive reorganisation, and also the reorganisation of the nursing profession through the introduction of the Salmon structure.<br><br>
My own view—I hope that the Minister will accept this, and forget about abolishing local health councils or asking health boards to do away with the district tier—is that the NHS should be left alone now and allowed to get on with its work. It has suffered far too much organisation and reorganisation in the past 10 years.<br><br>
On the question of the possibility of health boards abolishing the district, I can tell the Minister that I have seen the proposals of the Forth Valley health board, and if he thinks for a minute that the purpose of the proposals is to save posts, he must think again. There is nothing in the proposals to give the impression that any posts will be saved. In fact, the proposals are for medical managers, bed managers and a host of new titles. I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) who complained about new jargon. When the Minister sees the early proposals from the Forth Valley health board to abolish the district tier, he will see some jargon that he has never seen before.<br><br>
The local health councils do a very good job, in my view, and that view is widely shared by people of all political parties. The Minister will do a disservice if he seeks to abolish local health councils.<br><br>
I should like the Minister and his officials to give some serious thought to the question of preventive medicine. We all know that one of the growing problems among old folk is the onset of senile dementia. Evidence is now appearing that the ability to get old folk out into the community, where they can meet as many people as possible from day to day, and talk and discuss as much as possible to keep their minds active, staves off the day when they may be afflicted with that terrible ailment and have to be admitted to one of our geriatric units.<br><br>
The Scottish Office should conduct a survey on the possibility of free transport for old-age pensioners being introduced nationally to make it possible for our old people to get out as much as possible. In my view, based on the early evidence that I have seen, there would be a strong possibility of substantial savings being made for the Health Service.<br><br>
I am conscious that the Minister is anxious to reply to the debate but I hope that, if he does not take on board the criticisms—I know that he will not take on those—he will take on board the constructive part of my remarks. I hope that he will ask his officials to look at the question of free transport for pensioners. Massive savings for the NHS could be involved if only pensioners were active for longer and kept out of geriatric units.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
his reference to a personal matter. 1 am glad to say that I was fortunate in having my father live into his ninety-third year. I do not know how many of us are likely to do that.<br><br>
We have had a most interesting debate this morning, with many contributions on various subjects, covering a wide range of viewpoints. With the time left at my disposal, I shall not be able to answer all the points that have been brought up, but I shall do the best that I can.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) began his speech with an interesting remark about the promotion prospects of the civil servants who wrote my speech. It was the bit that I wrote that he was worried about, not the bit that they wrote. They are on the right road. There is no need to worry about them.<br><br>
I always congratulate the hon. Member for Mary-hill on his constant dogged interest in the problems of rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis. I shall look into his suggestions. I do not see why I should not visit Baird street clinic. The hon. Gentleman knows the problems of transferring to Glasgow Royal, and I should not want to go there at the wrong time. However, a great deal has already been done in this sphere, and a regional centre has been established for the boards concerned. In Glasgow, of course, that could now be happening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Craigen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will look at that, will he?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) spoke about the structure and management of the Health Service with particular reference to his own west district in Grampian. I take the point made by my hon. Friend, but I would again stress that, even though my right hon. Friend has suggested that there could be a slimming down of administration, ultimately it is for the boards to decide whether they retain their districts.<br><br>
We have suggested, however, that boards consider seriously whether districts are necessary. For example, at present we repeat every board function at district level, and there might be a case for not having to repeat every function, which could lead to a slimming down of administration.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also mentioned local health councils, and that matter came up time and again. All I shall say about local health councils is that some are doing a very good job but others are inclined to stray into jobs that are not necessarily their function. That is the point I seek to make about local health councils. We must bear one matter in mind in regard to consumer representation. Neither health councils nor health boards are elected. Both are selected, which makes matters rather difficult when they seek to represent consumers. I must make that point.<br><br>
I agree with what my hon. Friend said about the mentally handicapped. Both medical and lay thinking at present is that wherever possible people should be treated within the community and not institutionalised. I also accept my hon. Friend's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
point about the relationship between the Government and the board. In those matters the responsibility is ultimately for the Government.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon), as one might expect, mentioned Inverclyde DGH and the non-use of 76 beds. However, in that regard, I point out that the population in the Argyll and Clyde area fell during the construction of the hospital and that the number of beds originally planned is not now needed. In fact, the right hon. Gentleman's board area now has the same percentage of beds to population as the rest of Scotland by not using those beds, so it is not a question of finance but of having the same proportion of beds as the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. J. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister be kind enough to give the numbers on the waiting lists?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I went through the waiting lists in my original submission.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also made a point about SHARE, but SHARE is not appropriate for a new hospital. The boards would have to be given the money instead. I remind those who attack SHARE that it was introduced by the Labour Government.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) made a useful contribution to the debate, during which he brought up the problem of whether children should be born in Oban or in the Vale of Leven. I know about my hon. Friend's worries in that regard, because he has spoken to me about them and I shall see whether there is anything my Department can do by investigating the matter, although, as we know, it is basically a board responsibility. I am sorry that my hon. Friend feels that a heavy weight has been placed elsewhere.<br><br>
In regard to flouridation, I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend said. The evidence is now beyond refute, but at present it is not a case of instructing anyone to do anything. The whole matter is sub judice—I picked up those words from my legal friends—because of a court case going on in Glasgow. However, I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said on the subject.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) made a predictable speech. He was kind enough to say that he hoped to be able to catch your eye, Mr. Gourlay, and sure enough he did. He went through the claims he made when we sat together on the Health Services Bill about the Government's intention to transfer payment for the Health Service form taxpayer to user. As I said earlier, the hon. Gentleman may believe that that is our intention, but although we may be considering the matter of various extra funds for the Health Service, that has not been stated by the Government at any time.<br><br>
I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's remarks about prescription charges. Whenever his party is in opposition, it says that prescription charges will be abolished, but each time it is in power they are put up.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
The fact that we wish to encourage the private sector does not mean that we wish to abolish the National Health Service. We want to see sensible and forward-looking people, such as Mr. Chappie, taking their unions into it, thus taking the strain off the Health Service and allowing more people to contribute if they so wish.<br><br>
You had to intervene, Mr. Gourlay, when the hon. Member expressed his views on Trident and its cost of £6,000 million. It seems that the hon. Member hopes to catch Mr. Speaker's eye in the Chamber this afternoon. I suggest that he may get ruled out of order if he talks about health in the way that he spoke about Trident in this Committee. It is not our task to discuss the country's spending on defence. We are here to consider how we use funds on health.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman knows all the reasons for the problems relating to the children's hospital—the speed with which it was built is the reason for the faults.<br><br>
I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's threats about what a future Labour Government would do in respect of the National Health Service and private practice. We believe that they should be complementary. If the hon. Gentleman believes that there should be a total separation, he goes against the philosophy which his party has espoused about industry and the mixed economy. He does not want it in the Health Service. We wish the two sectors to co-operate to the good of the population.<br><br>
I wish to clarify one matter. There was a little trouble between my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth as regards what was said about cardiac surgery in Lothian region. There is some delay in Lothian about the siting provision of a second operating theatre in Edinburgh. There are differing views among the cardiologists and cardiac surgeons concerned. My Department is in close touch with the board with a view to obtaining firm proposals as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I cannot give way, because of the time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
Since the Government took office, nurses' basic pay has increased by approximately 45 per cent. Improvements in conditions of service, such as the reduction in the working week and increased special duty payments for unsocial hours, have increased total pay by around 55 per cent. Nurses are being given the same offer within the 6 per cent, cash limit as that which has been taken by the doctors and by 2 million other public sector workers, including Health Service workers.<br><br>
We have shown in the debate that the National Health Service in Scotland has improved appreciably since 1979. However, we shall not stand still and say that it cannot be further improved. We recognise that much more needs to be done and, as resources become available, much more will be done.<br><br>
I share the view of the 1979 Royal Commission that health care demands are potentially unlimited. As the hon. Member for Fife, Central remarked, all the money now spent on health, defence and education could be spent only on health and still more would be needed.<br><br>
Our health provision is not Utopian—nor is it elsewhere. No one has yet established what Utopia would cost. No Government can sign a blank cheque.<br><br>
We are doing more than our predecessors. We have given a real increase of 3 per cent, to health spending in Scotland. We are employing some 200 more doctors and some 2,000 more nurses. Such action is being taken by a Government whom the Opposition castigate for not caring. We are the party that cares, by spending more. We are providing as much money as we can afford at present. We are not wavering in our pursuit of the unattainable goal of perfection in the NHS. We shall pursue that goal for as long as we are in office, and that will be a long time.</span></p>
