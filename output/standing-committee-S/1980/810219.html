	<p>	<i>Question proposed [17 February],</i> That this schedule, as amended, 'be (the Second Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee ground to a halt on Tuesday my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) had just finished his contribution. We have not attempted in detail to amend schedule 2, but that does not preclude us from raising a number of matters of relevance and interest. Indeed, we have a duty so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2, in the Government's estimation, is a matter of some importance. We have always been led to believe that there is an important libertarian theme behind the Bill. Some of us have greeted this news with a little scepticism, but we understand that it is a measure which is intended to remove the chains and to unfetter local authority discretion. The rather slim claim to justification for this is found, as I understand it, in this schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses, say of clause 22, the paving clause for the schedule:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These relaxations contribute to the implementation of the Government's policy to allow local authorities to carry out more of their functions without unnecessary interference."</p></blockquote>
I think that I speak for all my hon Friends when I say that we are astonished to know that it is the Government's policy to allow local authorities to carry out their functions without unnecessary interference. Possibly the Under-Secretary would have to shelter behind a technical argument as to the meaning of "unnecessary". My impression is that the Government are determined not only to interfere but to meddle and if necessary to do damage, for all sorts of political and ideological reasons. Perhaps that is something else which we shall have a chance to discuss under clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event it is important to establish that we regard the (relaxations of control that are enumerated and set out ad longem in schedule 2 as being very petty and minor concessions. We are obliged to my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for a fine sustained essay. I was going to say "flight of fancy", but that would be unfair, because he drew attention to a matter of interest to those involved in debates on the countryside. The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), who is up to his hocks in countryside matters, with a Private Member's Bill, will appreciate
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
that. The important point about a large number of these "concessions", as my hon Friend illustrated, is that they are not concessions of substance at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highways (Provision of Cattle-Grids) Act 1950 and the removal of the power to make regulations on cattle grids got us into the private and charming world of hedgehogs at our last sitting. The important point is that the Government coyly reveal, in the notes on clauses, that these powers have not been exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are saying that these are important concessions, that local councillors will feci that Big Brother is no longer breathing over their shoulders, and that the world is a freer and happier place, in which they can exercise discretion, it is unsatisfactory to discover in so many cases that the powers being abolished have in fact fallen into desuetude and are redundant lumber upon the statute book. The appearance of liberalisation and the colouring that the schedule purports to give to what is in fact a dictatorial and illiberal Bill are fraudulent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the notes on clauses we are told of clause 22, the trigger clause, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Convention"—</p></blockquote>
I assume that that is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, COSLA—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been consulted and most of the relaxations have been agreed."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether there is any significance in the word "most". I should say in fairness to the Minister that I have had no particular representations. COSLA and most individual local authorities have merely groaned when they have looked at schedule 2 and recognised that it has nothing of reality in it for .them. But it might be worth ascertaining from the Minister which of the relaxations referred to in the schedule have not been agreed with COSLA and what is the significance of "most".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be fair to delay the Committee for long on this schedule. I said at an earlier stage that I was greatly looking forward to debating the Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act 1855, the Cremation Act 1902 and certainly the Methylated Spirits (Sale by Retail) (Scotland) Act 1937, because of my ignorance, which I fully conceded, of the details of those measures. But when I looked at them in preparation for the debate, I was disappointed to find that there was nothing in them into which I could get my teeth. They fell into the category of cosmetic window-dressing liberalism to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to plough into paragraph 29, which deals with the interesting matter of the titles of conveners and chief elected persons of local authorities, and paragraph 30, concerning' the names of local authorities. But the splendid efforts of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) have rendered that redundant. We were all intending to plunge into the kingdom of Mutch and the possibility of the People's Commissar of Lothian appearing in the fevered mind of the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). But I do not intend to do so. I merely seek clarification on a couple of points in which I am genuinely interested. Under the 1973 Act, the term "lord provost" is retained for the four cities. That clearly gives them the right to describe their chief elected member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
as the lord provost. The Act goes on to take away the Secretary of State's consent for any other change. It is of some interest to know whether the use of the term "lord provost" is exclusive. I do not laugh at this, because Perth has felt strongly about it in the past, as no doubt others do. There are those who take the view that a cathedral in a town makes it a city, and therefore one could have a lord provost of Brechin, for example. What I am interested to know is whether there is anything to prevent other district councils from describing their chief elected member as lord provost because, although some landward area had been taken in, they were still basically centred on a traditional burgh which had aspirations because of its antiquity, because of a visit from Queen Victoria in more recent times and a slip of the tongue by that good lady, or because it included a cathedral city. If so, they would break the exclusive club which might have been preserved —I accept that the word "might" is relevant—by the Secretary of State's consent. It would be worth knowing whether that is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into flights of fancy. That is a genuine possibility which may appeal to a good number of the district councils. There may be people who take the view that "provost" should become a word just for the chief elected member of a local authority, and there would be no reason why one should not have .the lord provost of Strathclyde as well as the lord provost of Glasgow, because it is a familiar title with which people can identify. I am sure that they could call themselves "provosts"; whether they could call themselves "lord provosts" the Minister will elucidate. Presumably that is a possibility which we ought at least to consider without going into the realms of fancy, and assuming, for example, that those in favour of all-purpose authorities would call their chief official a Pooh-Bah, Mikado or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to direct the Under-Secretary's attention to one or two other paragraphs in this schedule, most of which I intend to deal with fairly briefly. We have had some reference to paragraph 3, which concerns the repeal of part of section 9 of the Cremation Act 1902.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may confess my sins, I intended to telephone local government officials in my area to find out a little about cremation fees at present. I think that it is an area of some controversy. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire very properly referred to the anxiety, and I think in some areas the legitimate anger about the way in which successive Governments but particularly this Government— the Government of the day must bear the brunt of the battle—have treated the level of death grants. The other day I heard some fierce complaints about the fees paid to medical practitioners for signing cremation certificates, which many of us feel is a difficult perquisite to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the notes relevant to paragraph 3 we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the present inflationary period such requests"—</p></blockquote>
for the increase in charges for cremation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"have been very regular and have never been refused."</p></blockquote>
Some of us may well feel that, against that back
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
ground, they should have been refused. Has the Secretary of State ever considered the use of his powers under section 9 of the 1902 Act? If so, what inquiries he has made into, for example, the validity of this increase in fees and whether it could be justified. I do not want to press the Under-Secretary for a lengthy explanation, but perhaps he could say a word or two about whether there is uniformity of crematoria fees throughout Scotland. I should have thought that one of the purposes of keeping a section 9 power might have been to ensure that crematoria fees remained at a reasonably equitable and even level throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Methylated spirits turned out to be an anti-climax for me. I notice that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it was intended to alleviate the problem of crude spirits drinking by controlling sales. The power to set the registration fee was transferred to local authorities … and this amendment similarly transfers the power to decide on the nature of the application form."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, this is a minor tidying-up amendment which allows the local authority with the general statutory duty of controlling sales by registration also to control the form whereby registration is applied for. That seems to be an entirely sensible provision, a tidying-up matter—-hardly earth-shaking, but one of which we would all approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Under-Secretary could tell us a little about what local authorities have done to control the sales of methylated spirits for crude spirits drinking and how the registration has worked in practice. I must confess that I am lamentably ignorant on this point. Anyone who moves through George Square at certain times, in certain lanes which I could name and which, as someone who has been involved in criminal cases in Glasgow, I know well, will know that the drinking of methylated spirits is still a particular problem, and one that can sometimes lead to very unpleasant violence and to a great deal of damage to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 is of slightly more interest. I am a little curious about it. It deals with The Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1959. As I understand it, there was a provision that the Secretary of State had to consent to any move by a local authority to take into ownership land which formed part of a common or open space or had been compulsorily acquired under Paragraph 9 of schedule 2 of the Act, or which had been held for use as allotments. What we have here is a move by the Secretary of State to get rid of the necessity for his consent in terms of the compulsory purchase provision and in terms of the open space or common. I suppose that that would be a good generic term. Rather quaintly— I am not clear about the justification—.the Secretary of State's permission will still be required if the action of the local authority affects ground used for allotments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all appreciate the admirably well-organised lobby which can spring up in terms of allotments, but I am sure that the Minister is above being pressured by that lobby. He will have looked at this objectively and considered the case for consistency.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
Where it was abolished for two categories, it seems a little strange that consent, which he sees as unfortunate and something to be abolished on all possible occasions, should still be necessary in the case of allotment land. I am a little surprised. I trust that it has nothing to do with what I understand was the considerable row that broke out in England on a similar subject. Perhaps he could give us the precise reason in terms of constitutional theory or administrative practice why allotments have been put in this special position as against, for example, the taking of common land on a piece of park land which has been used' by the public, an open space hallowed by use by the public in a village, say. Why should that not require his consent, while, if cabbages are grown upon it, it does?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes give the general justification that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is considered that the local community are better placed than the Secretary of State to express a view on a proposed appropriation."</p></blockquote>
This is interesting. It assumes that the local authority represents the public view and the Secretary of State does not need to have oversight. Clearly the presumption is that if the local authority comes to the conclusion that a piece of common land or open ground can be appropriated and taken over by the local authority, that local authority knows local views best and the Secretary of State does not need to interfere. If that is so, I am curious to know why the same argument was not followed in terms of allotment land. I am sure that the Minister can give us a speedy and tidy answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a brief question on paragraph 13, which refers to police authorities and the payment of merit awards to policemen
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other persons who have shown exceptional merit or who have helped the police."</p></blockquote>
I gather that these payments can be made to members of the public. I presume that they are minor payments in the totality of police finance and that a merit payment is a once-for-all payment in the case of a police constable and not a permanent increment to his salary. It sound a naive question, which I am sure can be quickly disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "merit payments" always triggers in my mind the merit payments in the medical world, some of which are substantial. They are allocated to doctors by committees of their peers. The last time I looked at this system, they amounted to substantial regular payments to anyone who was a chief of a unit in a teaching hospital in Scotland. I am sure that there is nothing analogous here. Presumably they are very small payments in recognition of specific acts of valour, but as we are sweeping away the necessity for the Secretary of State's consent, perhaps the Minister would say a few words for the record about what is involved in these payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. While the hon Gentleman is correct and in order in discussing merit awards under the Police (Scotland) Act, discussing awards to consultants in hospitals would not be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Gourlay, I hasten to agree. I will say nothing more about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pointing out that the Minister would be out of order in replying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr Gourlay, I would not expect him to say anything about merit awards for consultants in hospitals. That would be a very wicked thing for him to do. I was merely instancing that the term "merit award" can cover a multitude of payments of varied significance. I merely used that as a passing analogy to explain why I wanted to establish what was involved in these particular merit payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 14 concerns the directors of social work. I ought to know the answers to these points, because at one time I was professionally employed on the fringes of the social work world, and I well remember the problems that arose in Grampian a few years back when the local authority indicated a wish to appoint someone whom the Secretary of State was unwillingly to approve in terms of his professional qualifications. As I understand it, subsequently orders have been laid and the professional qualifications of any applicant for a directorship of social work have now been specified and defined. On that basis the Secretary of State is now prepared to withdraw from this field and leave it to the local authority, so long as those people shortlisted and considered fall within the requirements of the professional definitions made in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would just confirm that that is the position, and what the professional qualification is. I presume that it is a professional qualification in social work, but as this is a complicated field, no doubt the Minister will indicate exactly, so that we can all have our memories refreshed and be satisfied that he is right in thinking that no further general oversight is necessary on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to make a personal judgment on the suitability of the personal qualities of a candidate. His remit should be a very different one—merely to ensure that the person considered has the kind of professional background that would allow him or her to become a candidate. I presume that that is now adequately covered, but I would toe happy to have it confirmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be glad to know, Mr. Gourlay, that I have come to the last point that I intend to mention —although it would be possible to go through these seriatim and at great length—the vexed question which my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian very properly raised of tree preservation orders. This is merely a matter of explanation. Hon Members ought to spend more time considering this matter, because there is no doubt that tree preservation orders are important. I am a tree enthusiast, possibly because I do not have to manage agricultural land and I do not have to worry about the implications of wooded land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in towns and urban areas there is a strong case for tree preservation orders, and I wish that we were more systematic. Many local authorities have a good record, but in some areas we could probably give more attention to replacing mature timber as it goes. We would all be infinitely poorer if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
a tree became a rare object in our cities, never mind in our countryside. Some of us even in the countryside worry about the growth of the conifer and the disappearance of traditional hardwoods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister about the logic of what he is doing? I may have misunderstood the provisions of paragraph 22, but it appears that the Secretary of State will not have to confirm a tree preservation order, even if there are objections to it. In other words, .the local authority is left as judge and jury in its own case. If it decides to make a tree preservation order in, say, a city square, and there are fierce objections, there is no need for the Secretary of State to be involved. It is a matter entirely for the local authority. I am not sure that I am opposed to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities cannot be trusted to manage tree preservation orders correctly, how can they be trusted to run the affairs of their area? We also say that once a tree preservation order has been confirmed, if subsequently there is a request to fell, because the trees are affecting light, or if in the country they are affecting some agricultural operation, the local authority cannot be trusted to be judge and jury in such a case. For some peculiar reason the Secretary of State is preserving his right to be involved in that kind of situation. There would be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against the local authority's decision to enforce the preservation order and prevent the felling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose the relaxation, but I would have thought that prima facie there was a case for extending it and saying that if local authorities can be trusted to take the final decision, even in the face of objections, in terms of establishing a tree preservation order, that would seem more fundamental than the subsequent operation of the order. I hope that the Minister will address himself to why he has not gone a little further down the road and removed the dark and stultifying hand of the Secretary of State from this area altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my colleagues may well think that these are minor matters, and I confess that they are. Some of them—the blocking up of roads, for example—are extremely technical. I certainly agree that that should be left to the local authority. Others, like the extinguishing of rights of way, might become local issues, where the Secretary of State is again withdrawing from the field. Basically, I accept that most of these are minor matters and not ones on which we wish to beat our breasts and rend our clothing and call conspiracy against the Under-Secretary. From the very fact that we are in this position and that of the 29 paragraphs to which I have referred only four or five are substantial, and perhaps more comprehensible, one sees that there is very little red meat in schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Secretary of State and a number of others suggested that this was a breaking of bonds, a throwing away of inhibitions and necessary restrictions. They said "We are doing something of real significance to allow local authorities to carry out their function without unnecessary interference." That is almost impossible to substantiate in the light of the schedule. It is perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
a nice sloganising and a counter-irritant argument to the realities of what is happening in clauses 13 and 23 and various other parts of the Bill. As has been said by our friends and colleagues in local government, there is nothing in the schedule to give them joy or consolation. There is nothing to make a councillor go more happily into the chamber with the knowledge that it is on the statute book, while there is a great deal in other parts of the Bill that will give sorrow and pain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot pretend that I extend any gracious welcome to schedule 2 as it stands. It is the worst sort of minor window dressing. Some of the propositions in it might be useful, but they are a poor plank if they are being used by the Minister to justify his own virtues in the face of the wholesale attack on local Government independence which is made by other parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a long speech, but I intervene with regard to one of the points made by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) concerning Grampian, because I had a minor involvement in it at the time. Paragraph 3 deals with the Cremation Act 1902. Will the Under-Secretary explain what the "Local Government Board" is? It sounds like the school boards which used to exist at the turn of the century and administered education. I wonder whether this is something of the same. I have not encountered it before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board has ceased to exist, and its functions have been assumed by the Secretary of State for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a redundant organisation. I wonder whether this means that there will be less control over the charges made by local authorities for cremation. One of the representations which I have had since coming to this place has been about the cost of dying, which presents real problems for many old people. All the pensioners' organisations in my constituency have from time to time written to me saying that the present level of death grant is inadequate and that many old people are faced with problems in dying with dignity. The opportunity to do that is diminished, and they are concerned that their savings will probably not meet the cost of a funeral. The costs attached to cremations are considerable and are a great worry for many old people who are on their own in this world. There are many of them. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something helpful about that.

I hope that the Minister will be able to give us assurances that what we are doing here will not open up an opportunity for local authorities to push even higher the charges for cremation.

I have been very touched by all the references to hogs in the Committee. The concern of my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for hogs of any sort is welcomed in certain quarters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say something about the Grampian region appointment, I hope that the Minister will clarify it. It was a very nasty incident in Grampian region. It was widely reported in the Scottish press, even beyond the boundaries of the 	<i>Press and Journal,</i> which I used to believe were the boundaries of the world. I hope that the hon Gentleman will be able to say that this will improve the situation, inasmuch as the local authority will have the right to make an appointment, always allowing for the fact that qualifications for the post are laid down. If that were the case I would be quite happy. But I have noticed that, throughout the schedule and the Bill, there are many references to the Secretary of State ceasing to have powers. We shall have a controversy about that on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill, because there the Secretary of State is removing from himself powers over school closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not help thinking that our Secretary of State is assuming some of the characteristics attached to that B-film President, Mr. Reagan, who made a speech yesterday to Congress in which he said that one of the objectives of his Administration would be to remove regulations. I could not help thinking that the Secretary of State for Scotland was doing that in a minor way in schedule 2, because time after time it states that his powers in certain respects will cease to have effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 4 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 is dealt with in paragraph 16. Will this make life easier for builders and members of the public who make application to local authorities for planning permission? My hon Friend the Member for Garsoadden will recall that I used to work in a building authority department as a bureaucrat. I was a most enthusiastic bureaucrat, but I soon
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
saw the error of my ways. At that time I was appalled by the maze of regulations which surrounded constructing anything and doing anything at one's own home. One aspect was that an applicant would go to the local authority only to be told that his application was to be dealt with by another department in another place. It all became very complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked through this section, and it is very difficult to follow without having the other statutes to hand. As I understand it, again the Secretary of State seems to be releasing himself from some powers and adding others. It would be welcomed both by the local authorities and the public if it could be made much easier to make an application and to obtain building permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about the designation of local authority chairmen in paragraph 29. I am reminded of something that Robert Burns said. I am a little apprehensive about quoting him, because that was the right and privilege of the now Lord Ross of Marnock. Although I hope that I have many obvious qualities, I would never claim to be able to quote Burns as he did. Burns said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A prince can mak a belted knight,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A marquis, duke and a' that;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But an honest man's aboon his might,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Guid faith he mauna fa' that!"</p></blockquote>
There is something in that. Many of these titles are archaic and no longer appropriate because the areas of the local authorities that they serve no longer have the same local meaning as they had at one time. Therefore, one can understand authorities such as Perth, Elgin and the four cities laying claim to giving their chairmen particular titles that have some place in history. It is very difficult to see the appropriateness of some titles in places that simply do not have any connection with the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking, for example, of the district council of Bearsden and Milngavie. I am not making any disrespectful comments about the provost of Bearsden and Milngavie. It just seems to me that that is such a new creation, a sprawling suburb that has no real history, and the office of provost is as new as the district council itself. I wonder whether in that case it was appropriate and whether "chairman" was not the most easily recognised title for the office, and the most clearly understood by the people. But I should not want the people of Scotland to have the impression that the Committee is concerned simply with how to describe the chairman of a district council. At the end of the day it is not very important. I merely make the plea that if some authorities want to change they should be able to do it.

The comments of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) were very interesting. If he should become one of the 10 who, I understand, may go to another place, he could became the Thane of Fife.

When the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) indicated that he intended to quote from Burns, for a terrible moment I and my hon Friends thought that he had discovered a poem entitled "To a hedgehog", but we were fortunately spared.

The schedule consists of some 50 relaxations in the control that the Secretary of State exercises over local authorities. I was amused that the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) felt obliged to describe them as utterly trivial and pointless, but nevertheless managed to detain the Committee for more than half an hour in order to emphasise their triviality and irrelevance. The Government have not exaggerated their significance. The hon Gentleman will see that paragraph 10 of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Relaxation of controls should lead to small savings in manpower at both local and central levels."</p></blockquote>
That is the purpose of these sensible proposals. We have not exaggerated their importance, though it remains true that there are some 50 (relaxations in the Bill and approximately 50 more controls have been relaxed through non-statutory means by the Secretary of State in the last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to paragraph 1 in respect of burial fees has been made at the request of the convention. It makes sense for burial charges to be determined by the local authorities themselves, without taking up the time of the sheriff or the Secretary of State. Incidentally, the convention, so far as I am aware, has not objected to any of the proposals in .the schedule. It has expressly approved certain of them and has declined to comment on others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to cremation, the Secretary of State is the statutory successor to the Local Government Board, and he is at present responsible for approving proposals by the local authorities for increasing cremation charges. In practice, these applications have come forward only to take account of increases in prices and matters of that kind. I am not aware of my right hon Friend or his predecessor having ever declined to accept them, though there may have been such an occasion in the past. Normally these are matters concerned only with the effects of inflation, and it is clearly sensible that the local authority should be An a position to determine them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a lighthearted but nevertheless serious comment on the effect of the Highways (Provision of Cattle-Grids) Act 1950 on hedgehogs. The hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) seemed to suggest that section 11 was all that stood between the hedgehog and its mass destruction, if not its extinction. May I give the hon Gentleman and all who take an interest in these matters the assurance that the main assistance that the Secretary of State has given in practice over the years has been to give advice to local authorities as to the design and construction of cattle grids and similar artefacts. That advice will continue to be available to local authorities in future, but the regulations themselves have never been the basis
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
for promoting the sort of protection that the hon Gentleman was anxious to ensure. Therefore, no harm will be done by this provision.

As regards paragraph 14 and the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, hon Gentlemen will remember that the then Secretary of State in 1978 introduced regulations prescribing the qualifications of directors of social work. There now exists a general set of criteria to which local authorities must have regard in appointing a director of social work. In these circumstances there seems no need for the Secretary of State's involvement in the consideration of individual applicants. Indeed, it would seem positively undesirable. The regulations exist, and local authorities have to have regard to them in 'their appointments. I am glad that the hon Member for Garscadden agreed that it was inappropriate that the Secretary of State should involve himself in personal appointments of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of paragraphs 22 and 23 is to withdraw the Secretary of State from the tree preservation procedure. We think that planning authorities .themselves should be able to deal with the whole process of making tree preservation orders and should, as with other planning matters, be able to confirm them themselves, with or without modifications to take account of any objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is correct that these provisions will retain the right of owner-occupiers or tenants to appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal by the planning authority or an application to fell trees covered by tree preservation orders. There is an argument that one could quite easily have abolished both powers, but it seemed sensible, as we are making a change, to preserve an appropriate balance and to leave some residual right for the Secretary of State. There is no obvious argument for doing one rather than the other, but when we are dealing with a possible disagreement between a citizen and a local authority about the felling of a tree covered by a preservation order, there is likely to be even greater controversy than in the (initial application for such an order. Therefore, if there is to be a distinction, it would seem sensible to draw it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to argue that that is a self-evident proposition; it is a balanced judgment as to where the appropriate responsibility of the Secretary of State should lie. I certainly would not rule out the possibility that it may be desirable in future to remove even that residual position, if .that were considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a great deal of sound and fury about paragraph 29, concerning the titles of chairmen of local authorities. We had some delightful examples given to the Committee of the sort of titles that local authorities might choose to give to their chairmen if this goes through. Hon Gentlemen who have spent the greater .part of the time in Committee saying that major responsibilities had to be given to local authorities, and that it was wicked for the Government, even in the national interest, to seek to control anything that they did, nevertheless seemed terrified at the possibility of a local authority calling its chairman some exotic title. Hon Gentlemen should feel reassured that even if an authority sought to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
exercise that power in a foolish way, it would only make itself look ridiculous in the eyes of its local community, and, indeed, in the eyes of the people of Scotland as a whole. I agree that that is not a guarantee that it will not act in that way, but, if hon Gentlemen meant what they said in all 'their other fine speeches about how responsible our local authorities are, to suggest that, despite their sense of responsibility in matters financial, they cannot be trusted to have responsibility in what is, relatively speaking, an excessively trivial matter, suggests that hon Gentlemen are not being entirely consistent in their representations to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, as a result of these provisions, it would be open to a local authority to consider the use of the title "lord provost" for the chairman of its council. We will give some consideration to whether that would be appropriate. I am not convinced that there is any likelihood of gross abuse or that there would be any massive public harm done by any individual decision by a local authority in matters of this kind. It is something that local authorities will respond to in a sensible way, but I shall certainly give thought to the specific question of the position of "lord provost", if it is causing concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the notes on clauses the reason for imposing this very light control by the Secretary of State is said to be the fear expressed in the House of Lords that inappropriate titles might be used, so it was conceivable at that time that this might be abused. This is a genuine fear on the Opposition side of the Committee. I hope that the hon Gentleman will take it a little more seriously than he seems to be doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must all be a little suspicious if the hon Gentleman is defending an argument used in another place. Despite his protestation that he has no intention of going there in the foreseeable future, he seems very interested to see that its rights should be protected and observed. I think that there was an argument at the time of enactment of the legislation, when all the new local authorities were being created. If there had been no control at that time, there would have been a strong probability of each going in its own direction, with a multiplicity of different titles with no consistency at all. We have consistency at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it will be a destruction of all that we hold dear if one or two individual authorities choose, with the freedom permitted under this provision, to give their chairman a different title, if they think that appropriate. It is almost certain that the vast majority of authorities, for which this is not a matter of controversy, will simply continue using the titles that they have used up till now. I do not think that we should assume that local authorities will not act responsibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same considerations apply in respect of paragraph 30, which deals with the name of the authority. Since reorganisation there has been only one application to the Secretary of State for a change of name. That was in the case of Lanark, which wished to change its name to Clydesdale. The Secretary of State's view was that if this was the wish of the local authority there was no reason why he should refuse permission. I am sure that that would be the approach that he would take on other
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
applications of that kind. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to retain the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some concern was expressed by hon Gentlemen that as a result of the provisions of the paragraph on community councils the Secretary of State would no longer be involved in any proposals by local authorities to amend a community council scheme. The proposals in this part of the Bill have been welcomed both by the Scottish local authorities and by the Scottish Council of Social Service. It is perhaps significant that although all community councils were informed of them by the community councils magazine, only four out of a thousand or so have made representations to the Secretary of State expressing any concern about these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, of the 51 community councils prescribed in the Secretary of State's scheme only 14 have come into existence or are likely to in the foreseeable future. There has been no demand from the other parts of the city, apart from three potential councils which wished to be created, but then could not find sufficient candidates to meet the minimum requirements. Edinburgh district council clearly had some justification for suggesting that there was not particularly widespread demand for community councils. I have no doubt that if there is an active and healthy community council in existence, it will be respected by the local authority, and that all local authorities can be trusted not to abuse this particular provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Garscadden referred to the provision on methylated spirits. 1 assure him that the power to set the registration fee was transferred to the local authorities in the 1973 Act, and the amendment in this Bill similarly transfers the power to decide on the nature of the relevant forms to be used for the registration of sellers of spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 9 and 10 concern the Secretary of State's consent for the appropriation and disposal of land. For the time being the Secretary of State will retain his power to approve the appropriation or disposal of land held for use as allotments. It is a matter which has given rise to considerable public concern that the overall supply of such allotment land may be rapidly disappearing. In recognition of that public concern it was felt appropriate at this stage that that power should be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraphs 12 and 13, monetary awards are occasionally made by police authorities to members of the public who assist the police in varying degrees. Children may be given savings certificates and adults may receive sums from £3 upwards. Paragraph 13 removes the need for the Secretary of State's approval, which makes the position comparable to that which exists elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It is not a matter which should give rise to controversy.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
skated over a couple of things which I think deserved at least to have something in the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that we have received no submission from COSLA on this. I want to be reassured that no one has made any representations other than those listed in a written reply in 	<i>Hansard,</i> and that as regards community councils there is no objection to these relaxations. It would be wise to have that on the record. We obviously agree with some of the relaxations; some powers of the Secretary of State have not been used for years, and someone is just doing a nice wee tidy-up job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the written answer, the representations about the Bill are surprisingly few. This worries me a bit. We have even had some from Strathclyde this morning on clauses that we have already debated. I am a wee bit apprehensive that this has been rushed. I assume that there is still another local government Bill to come in the lifetime of this Government, if they last so long in their present confused state. It is all nice and cosy in this Committee but there are things happening in the outside world and in the Conservative Party that will make life difficult for the Prime Minister. We all know the feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I know that this is a minor part of the tidying up, and by no means bears any relation to some of the other clauses that we find offensive, I want to be satisfied that COSLA and all the others, apart from the written answer, have made no comment and are reasonably satisfied. There are some important matters on planning. I never feel that the planning legislation is adequately scrutinised here, because it is so complicated. I think that that happened when other local government Bills have gone through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask particularly what staff savings there are in the Scottish Office. The Minister spoke in his preamble about modest savings. I know that it is a genuine attempt in this instance to have some relaxation of control, but there must be some savings somewhere. Are we talking about considerable amounts in either numbers or costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon Gentleman's interest in the Government's survival prospects, which I would have thought were slightly better than the survival prospects of the Labour Party. But that is a matter which we can debate on another occasion. I understand that the opinion polls this morning suggest that the Government are more popular than the Labour Party, which is perhaps not particularly surprising in present circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff savings in the Scottish Office we estimate at about half a dozen, but it is difficult to be certain on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the agreement of COSLA, these proposals have not been rushed through. They were first put to the convention in 1979, and the convention had either specifically endorsed the proposals or simply not chosen to comment on them.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have remarked on a number of occasions, there is not a great deal in the Bill, but what there is is thoroughly objectionable. We dealt with clause 13 at some length and we now come to another exhibit, clause 23, about which we have dark suspicions. It falls into two parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part deals with a new power which has been taken by the Secretary of State to
	<br><blockquote><p>"withdraw, or vary the terms of, a consent"</p></blockquote>
which has been given for capital expenses under section 94 of the 1973 Act. I want to say a little about the motives behind the clause and the real reason why we imagine that the Secretary of State is introducing it. I suspect that it falls roughly into the category of another sanction which really strikes at revenue expenditure. I suspect that, in the same way as housing capital allocations are being attacked, if certain targets on rent are not met, the practical result will be that unfortunate local authorities will have sinister figures sliding up behind them in the night and saying "If you do not control your revenue expenditure, we shall use our powers under section 23 to grab certain of your already-allocated capital expenditure. That will put your whole building programme and your contract position into a state of such chaos that you will have to give ground and do what we want on revenue." I suspect that that unpleasant kind of blackmail will arise. It is becoming all too familiar in the Government's approach to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are all fairly simple in intention. Amendments Nos. 112 and 113 refer to clause 23(1B) 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b),</i> which state that the Secretary of State may withdraw or vary the terms of a consent. The amendments seek to omit the words "withdraw or ". This is an opportunity to learn a little from the Under-Secretary about how the system works and how it is intended to work in the future. Some of our amendments are extremely serious, but this one may—I stress "may"—turn out to be a probing amendment. Some of the others certainly will not. We object fundamentally to the concept of the Government changing their mind about the allocation of capital expenses once consent has been given, but I am also worried that the use of the words "withdraw or vary" may suggest that the Under-Secretary envisages a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
system of the kind that is operated in Lothian, where there is not block consent but individual consents for specific projects are being demanded. He may defend the wording on the ground that that may happen on a future occasion, and that it has to be included in the Bill in terms of flexibility of wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say these things a little tentatively, because I do not pretend to be steeped in this particular area of local government administration. I have never been a local councillor involved at that level. But in normal circumstances, I understand, what happens under section 94 is that the local authority is given a capital allocation which is divided into a number of blocks. There might be six or seven blocks of capital allocation which are devoted to a particular area of that council's activity. If that is to be the pattern, it seems alarming that the consent can be withdrawn. I can see that we might argue strongly against it and that the implications might be extremely serious, but there might be a case for saying that one of these block allocations could be varied. But the idea that it might be withdrawn, thus presumably cutting the local authority in a major area of expenditure from something to nothing, seems very serious, even if it is only in the Bill as a theoretical possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of two possible arguments which might be used by the Under-Secretary. One is that consent will be withdrawn in order that it may be reissued in a varied form. Surely the word "vary" would cover that. The other argument is that he envisages a recurring situation which would be fairly common where that block consent will be withdrawn and some unfortunate local authority will be put into a situation where it will need specific consent for every old person's home, every school extension, every playground lavatory and every hut in a physically handicapped centre. That has been used in Lothian. I think that it is a form of sanction. It has led to considerable delays and difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tend to under-price our own time and that of our associates. I suspect that if the Minister costed the many hours which his properly skilled and, I hope, adequately paid civil servants have to spend in administering and arguing the toss of each individual project the saving to the public purse could turn out to be illusory. In fact, there might be considerable costs written into system. I do not think that we should be including the words "withdraw or" on the assumption that at some point we may be dealing with an individual allocation system or individual consent system as a commonplace such as has been described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would expect the vast majority of cases to be where there would be a block consent system dealing with major areas of expenditure, whether regional or district authorities, island council or whatever. If we are to have this power at all it should be to vary the terms of consent and not to withdraw it. At best it gives a misleading impression of the intentions of the Secretary of State. If the Under-Secretary will accept from me the considerable dismay which powers like this have produced in local government circles, he will see that the cosmetic point about the withdrawal of the word "withdraw" is not insubstantial in itself. It is in fact very much better without this in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that as a brief introduction. I should like to introduce each amendment, indicate what they are about and the line of argument and then we can argue the toss if we are not satisfied with the reply from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
Under-Secretary. That deals briefly with Nos. 112 and 113.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 114 is clear in its intention, and 1 need hardly labour our point. The Secretary of State may withdraw or vary the terms of a consent
	<br><blockquote><p>"where, or in so far as, the local authority have not, by binding contract, incurred the liability to which the consent relates".</p></blockquote>
This gets us down to the mechanics of how it will work. I understand that the Government can say to region X "We are now going to withdraw consent. You have in your block consent a capital allocation of £30 million on your social work budget. We are now going to reduce that to £24 million. That means that you have somehow got to cut £6 million from your expected expenditure for the rest of the year." This can presumably happen at any point in the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this form of words is that the local authority will not be expected to do that in areas where it has already signed a contract. I presume that that is how it will be if we are dealing with block consent. It is perhaps easier to see the machinery of it in the Lothian situation, because clearly then the Secretary of State might say that he would vary or withdraw consent for a particular school or hostel, sheltered workshop, or whatever. Presumably he could do that up to the point where a binding legal contract had been signed. I think that that second case is clearer than the first, but I hope that at least I have got the outline of how the first would work as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the figures that I have given—say one had £30 million, the year was halfway through and there were binding contracts covering £20 million of the expected £30 million—one would have to make the £6 million savings demanded from the £10 million which had not been subject to legally binding contracts. That would create an enormous amount of difficulty for any local authority. One of the difficulties about section 94 procedure as it has been explained to me—and, I think, in numerous written representations—is that in any event these programmes do not work in nice, neat financial years. They work on rolling programmes, and one is looking at two or three years at a time when planning expenditure and signing contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This additional injection of uncertainty will create great problems for the local authorities. That is what I understand to be a fair bird's-eye view of what is presently envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are suggesting that that cut-off point of a binding contract incurring liability—presumably legal liability, a point at which a contract could be enforced in the courts or where some sort of penalty clause for abandonment might come into play—is far too late in the process. Amendment No. 114 seeks to bring that point back to the point when the contract in connection with which any consent has been given has gone out to tender. Or, if it were a block situation, the immunity would extend not only to particular projects where there had been a binding contract but where the local authority had gone out to tender. It seems to us to be much fairer to do it at an earlier stage in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point should appeal to Conservative hon Members, or the few of them who are lasting the pace this morning, for most of this morning we have been out-sitting the Government members of the Committee. I look forward at the end of the Committee stage to a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
gracious tribute from the Under-Secretary for the many hours when the Labour Members have kept the quorum while Government Members have been skulking in tea rooms, bars and telephone kiosks. However, I must not be distracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am making—this should appeal—is that once a contract has gone out to tender, substantial costs may well be incurred in terms of professional fees and preparation work in the local authority. Once one reached that stage, it seems only right that that particular consent should not be open to the latent threat of clause 23, that it may at any point be varied or withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Building Contractors Federation is, understandably, letting out great cries of pain about the policies of Her Majesty's Government. It is not extraordinary, given its financial difficulties and the difficulty in finding work, but it is an eloquent testimony to the disastrous consequences of the Government's policy. There are people who in very many cases have been—poor souls—contributors to Conservative Party funds and are now facing, literally in some cases, bankruptcy or certainly very stark financial difficulties as a result of the squeeze in the public sector. Many of them will point out that the additional uncertainty that will result from this clause will make their position that bit worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the amendment is not carried and the work goes out to tender: these people will spend an enormous amount of money and time trying to compete for the contract and perhaps will get to within a week or two of the final contract being signed. Along comes the Secretary of State, who says for reasons that we shall have to hear from him later, "We don't like your policies and we are going to use our powers to withdraw consent under section 23." All the effort and work which has gone into it in the private sector, let alone in the architect's department or the master of works' department of the local authority, may well go to waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a perfectly sensible case for amendment No. 114. If these arbitrary powers are brought in and there is the damaging uncertainty of possible variation or withdrawal, it should at least be clear that that must be done before contracts go out to tender rather than before the point at which the final binding contract is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final amendment in this coherent group—I make no complaint about the fact that they have been put together—is amendment No. 115, which is closely interrelated with the argument that I have been advancing. I hasten to say that the drafting may well be so defective in its present form as to be unacceptable, but the amendment expresses in lay language a perfectly clear intention. I am sure that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Under-Secretary, if he is sympathetic to the intention, to ensure that the right form of words is evolved from the drafting offices of his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point, which will hold good whether or not amendment No. 114 is passed and will still be relevant with the present drafting of the clause, concerns a local authority which has genuinely expended money
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
on a contract for which it had legitimate and proper consent, whether it be individual consent or whether, more normally, it was a block consent and the project was included within the spending guidelines allowed by that block consent. It has incurred architects' or professional fees, such as quantity surveyors' or drawing office fees and so on, and, through no fault of its own, but merely because of a change in public expenditure policy by the Government or a sudden realisation that the Government had to get money back somehow from local government, along comes the Secretary of State and says "Awfully sorry, lads, we are making a new section 74(1B) order and we are going to claw back a substantial number of millions of pounds", either naming that specific contract—varying the consent for it—or in the block grant forcing the authority to cancel that contract in order to meet the new totals. It seems not unreasonable that the legitimate fees that have been expended in good faith on proper authority should be reimbursed to that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be a matter of common decency and respect for the ratepayers. We hear a great deal from Conservative Members about ratepayers and the difficulties that they are in. They may be subjected to the disappointment of losing what is almost certainly a valuable facility with the withdrawal of consent. I should not like to explain to the parents of a severely handicapped child, for example, that the much-needed expansion of facilities, indeed the creation of facilities for the adult severely handicapped in certain parts of the West of Scotland, have had yet again to be cancelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If added to that there is the pinprick of insult, of saying "By the way, all the money that we have expended in preparation for this building for which we had consent will now be a charge on the rates, and nothing will be left but a gap site where the building was to have been, because of the actions of the Secretary of State", it seems perfectly reasonable that a local authority should be able to say "Here are our accounts. This is the work we did, perfectly legally on the basis of the consent. This is the costing of it. Can we have that money back from the Secretary of State?" That seems to me to be a matter of equity and justice, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will look with a sympathetic eye at amendment No. 115.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment becomes less important if amendment No. 114 is accepted, because if that amendment is passed the cut-off date is much earlier in the process and the chances of expanding significant sums of money are that much reduced. But if the Under-Secretary resists amendment No. 114, and if the cutoff point at which cancellation can take place is only at the point when the binding contract is signed, there is a real possibility of significant sums of money being involved, and the need for amendment No. 115— the reimbursement amendment, if I may so call it—is that much the stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall oppose the clause. But, on the assumption that the Secretary of State wishes this and that his satrap on the Front Bench opposite will argue for it and marshal his troops to force it through, I think that at least these amendments would do something to clarify
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
the situation in one case and to ameliorate the damage in the other. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again we come back to the principle involved. I have no objection to any Government seeking to secure those powers that they need in the interests of the overall management of the economy, to the extent that any Government can manage the economy. So I start with a fairly relaxed approach, in that I do not think that any of us can object in principle to the right of Government to have some influence, indeed power of decision, over the amount of capital borrowing required by local authorities. I hope that the Minister will not try to score any points off the Opposition as to what happened in some previous Act or under a Labour Government. I accept completely that the Government have a right to exercise this control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle, if I can call it that, in clause 23 and in the amendments is purely for the Government to show us why they are worried, where there has been the abuse, the difficulty or the lack of understanding or interpretation of the existing system. I ask the Under-Secretary particularly to address his mind to housing expenditure, which I think forms about 50 per cent, of the capital expenditure of local government in Scotland, and to the extreme worry of building contractors and all the other bodies that supported CABIN.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit to having some friends in the building and construction industry. My first reaction is to say, "Hell mend you for supporting this Government". But they are in desperate straits now, and this is a matter of extreme concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I do not know the answer to the question that 1 am going to ask. How was the moratorium on the housing associations applied? What was the statutory power for that? The Minister is now presumably seeking to have some such similar power to apply to regional and district authorities. The housing content is vital, and I suspect that this is very marginal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been most helpful with the notes on clauses, but they tell us only what the changes are to do; they do not tell us why they are necessary. Therefore, I think that we would be failing in our duty if we did not, by these legitimate and probing amendments, ask the Minister to justify this change. It seems irresponsible unless there is a good case. We are dealing here not with rogue authorities, but with all authorities. There will will now be an uncertainty injected into their permissions. Even though they have been granted permission—if that is the right expression—to borrow on various capital projects, the Secretary of State might at any time withdraw permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have guidelines been discussed? Under what circumstances might the Secretary of State do that? Will it be entirely because the following week the Cabinet will have another look at public expenditure before the Budget, and there are to be further cuts and panic measures? If it were not for the fact that this Government have not been in for two years, I would say that they were on their last legs. They have all the signs of having lost their nerve. The Minister can laugh. Wait until he sees the comments about the Coal Board and the Government's withdrawal. These are all signs that the Government have lost their nerve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State wants the power, and we think that we can see the need in terms of the overall
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
management, the responsibility for any expenses incurred must be the Government's. Presumably professional fees and work already done before the point of entering into any legal contract are covered by capital borrowing as well. That is all part of the overall contract. I am interested in the mechanics and whether there is recompense to the authority for money that it has already spent in connection with capital projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member must be very concerned that every attempt he makes to depress my hon Friends simply leads to them appearing to be more cheerful than ever. The hon Gentleman will have to learn to live with the fact that he is to have a Conservative Government for a considerable time to come. His own contribution to this debate was very balanced, and he took a more reasoned approach to the background to this clause than his hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who seemed to be determined to find a reason for fury even when none existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in clause 23 are not as dramatic as the hon Gentleman suggested. They are, as his hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) indicated, a response by the Government to tidy up the control over capital consent. Indeed, these provisions if approved by the Committee would simply make the position in Scotland comparable to that elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I am not saying that that in itself proves that they are necessary, but it puts the matter in perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions give a general power to the Secretary of State to vary or withdraw consent. I can assure hon Gentlemen that the primary purpose for this, as the hon Member for Provan properly indicated, is the Government's overall objective and legitimate requirement to act in the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is a good debater, and I have always paid tribute to him, but can he make it clear, when he says that these controls exist in other parts of the country, that they were introduced only in 1980? Therefore, he has to make the case for needing these additional powers in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rif kind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is half correct. In England and Wales the whole system of obtaining a block capital consent was introduced only in 1980. As part of that introduction, there was a right enabling the Secretary of State to withdraw a consent once given. In Scotland the capital consent system was introduced slightly earlier, but without that provision. It is therefore perfectly fair to suggest that, if we are to have a block consent system instead of the specific consents which were the norm until recently in all parts of the country, there should be, consistent with that general consent system, a right to vary or withdraw in particular circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Secretary of State has not the remotest intention of using these powers in an irresponsible way or in a way which would interfere with, for example, the legal obligations of a local authority. The clause makes it abundantly clear that these powers could not be exercised so far as a local authority had a binding
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
contract and incurred the liability to which the consent related. That is a specific safeguard, which goes without saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way as the Secretary of State already can with bodies directly under his responsibility, if, during the year, the overall cash limit for that area of expenditure looked like being exceeded, it would be sensible for him to try to trim the consents in order to ensure that the overall consent was maintained. That is the primary purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although local authorities, with the best will in the world, seek to keep their expenditure within an overall cash limit, sometimes—not necessarily through their fault—that proves very difficult. Local authorities may, for example, incur a substantial proportion of liability in the earlier part of the year, and it may seem as if they are drifting towards exceeding the cash limit by a significant amount. It would not be inappropriate if the Secretary of State, with his responsibility to the national interest, wished to trim the position for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Provan mentioned the housing associations—a good example. The Housing Corporation during the year looked like exceeding its overall allocation, and the Secretary of State intervened to try to ensure that that did not happen. Our evidence makes it abundantly clear that but for the Secretary of State's intervention there would have been a breach of the cash limit, not because the corporation wanted it or because of bad faith on anyone's part, but because these matters are difficult to control. The Secretary of State, who has the overall responsibility of ensuring that the total amounts spent are within the limits indicated, clearly should do all in his power to see that those limits are observed. That is the reason for the change in clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to understand what the Minister is saying. I gather that the primary reason, as he calls it, is that overspending may arise. If we are talking about capital consent, presumably the local authority will not be able to overspend beyond what it already has consent for. Therefore, I do not understand what "overspend" means here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain to the hon Gentleman. He is correct that the statutory position is that a local authority, such as the Housing Corporation, is entitled to incur expenditure only up to the level of the consent that has been given by the Secretary of State. For example—it has happened before and will no doubt happen again—because of an excessively mild winter contracts sometimes come forward for completion much more quickly than expected, and the people carrying out the contracts are sending in the bills much earlier. Therefore, expenditure which one had expected to incur in the following financial year may fall to be paid in the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other factors which the body concerned may have misjudged or miscalculated and which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, perhaps halfway through the year, may indicate that there is likely to be a substantial overspend. The local authority may not agree with the Secretary of State. Indeed, all the bodies concerned may maintain that they are on course. But if the Secretary of State, with the information that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
has available, comes firmly to the view that the course of their conduct at that time may lead, however unintentionally, to a substantial overspend in the cash limit whereby the local authorities would at the end of the year have incurred liability substantially or significantly greater than the consent which he had given them, and if he is aware of that, it is not a question of his guessing in the air what the position may or may not be. There are regular returns from local authorities to the Secretary of State throughout the year, based on the experience of previous years, and it is possible for him to come to a judgment as to whether there is likely to be a significant overspend. This is not a theoretical problem. It actually occurred in the current year, and it is not unreasonable that, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State for Scotland should wish to have a similar facility available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister for a little more clarification? It will go some way to reassure people if the Under-Secretary is saying that a situation could develop where—I use the figures theoretically— there had been capital consent for the current financial year of £30 million, but four or six months into the year the returns that were coming in showed, perhaps not just because of good weather but because of the appalling slackness of the building industry, that contracts were being completed with unexpected speed and zeal, and that at the end of the year it was extremely likely in the view of the Secretary of State— we might quarrel about the validity of his judgment, but let us assume that it was valid—instead of having spent £30 million there would have been bills presented for £40 million, and there was a danger that those would be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that he would then adjust or vary the consent in order to ensure that no more than the original £30 million was spent, and is ruling out the possibility of varying or withdrawing consent, to reduce the original consent that was given? There is a big difference between taking a power to reduce the consent that has been given and merely using it as a way of regulating the likely demand upon the local authority's purse to ensure that it does not spend more than the original consent. I am sure that the Under-Secretary understands my question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand. Let me be perfectly frank with the Committee. It would certainly be open to the Secretary of State in very special circumstances actually to reduce the consent by the exercise of these powers. What I was indicating at this stage in my remarks was that what the Secretary of State is primarily concerned with is not to reduce a consent already given but to ensure that the totality of expenditure is kept within the actual total that had been given to the local authorities for the year in question. I will say later whether there are other ways in which he could use these powers available to him. But I was indicating, as I was requested to do, the basic reason for these provisions. Undoubtedly the reason is the earlier example that the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) put to me just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given the theoretical reason, but he has not given us any practical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
examples of where this has been causing concern— for instance, the housing associations. Would he apply that, in the light of his reply to my hon Friend, to the housing authorities and district councils, where he may not find it easy to vary or withdraw consent in one authority, for good reason in good faith, and therefore he has to go for some other authority which, because of its particular timing of issuing contracts, can have the hammer put on it? Why does he need this additional power when the tradition has been of underspending, certainly on housing? I am not arguing the case for any particular council, Dundee or Lothian. I am dealing with the general principle that with local authorities this has basically never been a real problem. Why is it now so important that we give this fairly extensive increase in the powers of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I clarify the position of the Housing Corporation, because it comes directly under the Secretary of State and does not need a specific statutory power. If he requests the Housing Corporation to restrict its incurring of liability, that is a direction which it would automatically observe. The principles are exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman is correct that until fairly recently local authorities were encouraged to make sure that they spent their full allocation. That is a trend which was changing two or three years ago. I make no secret of the fact that it is obvious that the substantial reduction in the allocations themselves has made it all the more likely that there will be a problem of overspend rather than underspend. It did not begin just 18 months ago, but it has been significantly influenced by the reductions in capital allocations, in the current year local authority actual expenditure will be just below or just above the consents given. That problem can be serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State would not wish to penalise an individual authority because other local authorities were creating problems with regard to the overall cash limit. He is anxious to be as fair as possible. The position he has taken all along on local authority expenditure has been to increase the means by which he can be selective. He has deliberately eschewed methods which would penalise authorities which have not been responsible for particular problems, because he recognises that that would create a justified sense of unfairness. That is the main purpose for which these powers are sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one specific area in which the withdrawal of consent is relevant—the urban renewal programme, where specific consents are given to individual projects. There is no block consent given. Therefore, there could not be variation. It would have to be withdrawal if any change were to be made in the capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another area which, as the hon Member for Garscadden recognised, exists in the case of Lothian region. Last year the Secretary of State withdrew from Lothian region the general block consent that all local authorities normally enjoy, because of its general expenditure policies and its refusal to seek to modify that expenditure. Over the last year, in the case of Lothian, the consent of the Secretary of State has been required for each individual capital expenditure project. That has led to significant savings in the region's overall expenditure. Over the last few days there has been a
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
request to the Secretary of State from the Edinburgh chamber of commerce and certain other interested bodies in Edinburgh, suggesting that, in order to achieve what they have described as a compromise with Lothian region, the Secretary of State might be willing to give back to the region the power to determine for itself how it exercises its capital expenditure, if Lothian region were prepared to reduce its proposed rates burden on the public. This suggestion was made by the chamber of commerce, the Institute of Directors and a number of other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make it perfectly clear that the Secretary of State will be only too happy to give Lothian region the same freedom of control over its capital expenditure as all other local authorities have, as soon as there is real evidence that that local authority is adopting a moderate and responsible position to its overall public expenditure. The Secretary of State would not wish to continue for one day longer than is absolutely necessary to exercise detailed control over the capital expenditure of Lothian region. If there is a proper and responsible reaction by the local authority concerned and a serious attempt to moderate its expenditure, not only in the national interest but in the interest of individual ratepayers and of employment in the Lothian region, the Secretary of State will be only too happy to respond in a generous way to such a change of heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister concede that one of the problems, which I imagine is one of the reasons behind this appeal from the chamber of commerce, is that if capital allocations are refused that will directly affect the employment in the region to a far greater extent than these alleged figures, which are without any substantial foundation but which come from the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) when he rants and raves about the effects of rate increases. The responsibility for further cutbacks in the building industry in Lothian rests with the Secretary of State, when he refuses capital allocations to that authority for capital projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) who has talked about the unemployment consequences in the Lothian region from the proposed level of expenditure.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is dealing with capital expenditure, one is not simply dealing with the capital projects themselves and the expenditure that they represent; one is also dealing with the revenue consequences of capital expenditure. If we are dealing, for example, with community centres, swimming pools or any other buildings of that kind, the staff that would have to be employed and the cost of running these establishments add up to a significant additional current expenditure which has to be borne directly by the ratepayer and which puts yet a further burden on the hard-pressed community under any authority that is determined not merely not to reduce its expenditure, but to plan for substantial growth at a time when the country as a whole—and

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that my hon Friend is correct.

The figures that one has seen of some 2,500 jobs that would be lost, as a direct consequence to the Lothian area from an increase of that kind cannot be ignored. Some of the more moderate and sensible elements in the Labour group in the region seem to recognise that fact. I am delighted that at long last there seems to be a debate going on about whether they really wish to put up the jobless figures and produce an intolerable burden on the community in the Lothian region.

The reply that his hon Friend received was that my right hon Friend would write to the hon Gentleman. There is no secret about this matter. Lothian region is obviously aware of the projects for which consent has been refused. The Secretary of State cannot keep this information to himself and not tell anyone. I can assure the hon Gentleman that it is a complicated matter to put in a parliamentary written reply, because what we are dealing with is not just one or two huge projects, but a number of other areas where consent has been sought for individual projects and the Secretary of State has believed that they are unnecessary in the present climate. But the information is not secret; it will be available to hon Gentleman. Even if the Government wished to withhold the information, there is no way in which they could do so, given that it is Lothian region which has been refused the consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that his right hon Friend is sufficiently accountable to the people of Lothian region or anywhere else in Scotland for this kind of detailed local decision-making which he is doing personally now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman must appreciate that the reason why this requirement has been introduced directly stems from the decision of the local authority in question. The hon Gentleman shakes his head, but he was one of the first publicly to question the decision of Lothian region last year to plan for growth in its budget. It did so then, despite his advice. It has done so again this year, despite his advice. I presume that he will be as critical of it this year as he was last year, and we hope that any representations from his own local party will not deflect him from that honourable course. But we wait to be convinced of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendments Nos. 114 and 115, with regard to contracts that, although not yet legally binding, may have been put out to tender, and the question of any reimbursement to a local authority. The distinction that we believe to be appropriate is a distinction between a financial commitment that has become legally binding on a local authority and one that has not become legally binding. That is where the question of fairness would be most obviously judged. The clause in its present form makes it abundantly clear that, where a commitment has become legally binding, where a contract has been entered into there should be no withdrawal of consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To introduce the restriction at the time of tendering
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
is, I believe, an artificial criterion. The mere fact that a contract may have been put out to tender does not in itself incur any legal liability for the local authority. Therefore, there is no reason why that should be used as the appropriate date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 115 talks about reimbursing a local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any financial loss including professional fees or other expenses resulting directly from any withdrawal or variation of consent".</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that this amendment is necessary. Where we are dealing with withdrawal or variation of consent, in the vast majority of cases, because of the purpose of the clause, which I said was to try to maintain expenditure within a cash limit, a proposed capital project which may have to be deferred because of the exercise of these powers will not be abandoned unless the local authority wishes to abandon it. What will happen is that it will come up in its next year's capital programme. Therefore, any planning expenditure on the preliminary planning work, any of the actual cash that will have been laid out on the purely preliminary matters will not be wasted. It will be just as available for use when the project eventually goes ahead, as in the vast majority of cases that we are likely to be talking about will happen. So we are not talking about money lost to a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the hon Gentleman's amendment would be unworkable. If a local authority in the middle of the year had done some preliminary planning work and incurred a modest amount of expenditure, and then there was a variation in its consent and it realised that it would have to bring up the project for the following year, at what stage would reimbursement take place? How would it be calculated whether the local authority had lost anything? In virtually all the cases that we are likely to have to consider in this context, the money would no be lost, the preliminary planning work would not be abortive. We would be dealing with a project which would actually be implemented in the succeeding year, and therefore no expenditure would have been incurred for an abortive purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that where there is a legally-binding contract and any expenditure which has been legally committed, the Secretary of State cannot use these powers. Therefore, by definition, the residual expenditure that is likely to have been involved is, by its nature, very modest, and, in the vast majority of cases, will be expenditure which, unless a local authority decides to abandon the project altogether, will be usefully utilised in the succeeding year. On that basis, I hope that the hon Gentleman will accept that these amendments are not appropriate at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the Edinburgh chamber of commerce is making representations to the Minister requesting him to do away with the present special relationship which he has introduced for Lothian regional council concerning capital consent, because of the appalling effect and uncertainty which this new arrangement under section 94 is having on this authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon Gentleman has misrepresented the chamber of commerce. It has not called upon the Government to withdraw the controls over capital expenditure, but it has said that it would

hope that if the local authority were prepared to reduce its current expenditure and its proposed rates burden the Secretary of State would respond by dropping the controls over capital expenditure. That is very different from what was being suggested by the hon Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to debate with the Minister on semantics. It appears that some of us, along with the Edinburgh chamber of commerce, think that the Secretary of State is behaving in an unreasonable and excessive manner in his present handling of section 94. Here the Minister is coming forward with a clause, which we are seeking to amend, which would give him even more draconian powers to mess around with local authorities' capital expenditure, as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said earlier with reference to what is happening in the Lothian region, where the Secretary of State is not giving advance block capital spending consent but is dealing with cases on an individual basis —or, rather in practice he is letting many of them pile up on his desk for a period of months, or until the day comes when he is feeling marginally less bloody-minded than he does normally, and he clears some of them. The remainder can stay on his desk for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mechanism that the right hon Gentleman is using is basically a malicious weapon with which he harasses certain local authorities, in this case Lothian region, with which he has picked a quarrel. Here we have the Secretary of State wanting to withdraw consent which has already been given. We are trying to prevent these powers from coming into his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful briefly to analyse the effects of what the Secretary of State is doing at present, under his existing powers, before we make any decisions on what powers to give him in the future. We had the Secretary of State crowing last month. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 27 January said that he had in effect reduced capital expenditure in Lothian region from £54.4 million to £42.8 million. What the chairman of the finance committee of Lothian regional council said about that cut imposed by the Secretary of State is probably relevant. Eric Milligan was reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> as saying that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By cutting back on public expenditure programmes, the Secretary of State was causing further damage to the construction industry and was doing nothing to alleviate unemployment."</p></blockquote>
That is a point which the hon Member for Edinburgh, South might like to take on board. Mr. Milligan went on to say that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's sanctions have cost the ratepayers additional money because of increased tendering costs caused by delays while individual approvals were awaited".</p></blockquote>
That is also an incontrovertible truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned to have more detailed information about how this special relationship with Lothian region is working at present. My hon Friend the Member for Garscadden has already quoted my question, which I tabled at the end of last month, asking which project he refused to give consent to. Here we are still waiting on 19 February for the Secretary of State to write to me listing what he has cut to date. It seems serious that the Secretary of State is not prepared to tell the House about the effects of the way in which he is exercising his existing powers before he seeks further powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
I pursued my quest for information with two more questions. I asked the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he will list the capital projects which have been delayed by more than one month as a result of the special arrangements which he has introduced for processing applications for consent to incur capital expenditure by Lothian regional council".</p></blockquote>
The right hon Gentleman replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since I have no means of identifying the many factors which may delay particular projects, I cannot identify which, if any, may have been delayed by the individual scrutiny which I have introduced."</p></blockquote>
That is complete humbug. The Secretary of State surely must know, or his civil servants must know, how long individual applications have been lying on his desk. I know of one rather minor application which has been lying on his desk for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked another question on the same day. I asked the Secretary of State:
	<br><blockquote><p>"when he expects to respond to the request which was made to him on 7 August 1980 by Lothian regional council for consent to provide a temporary community hall in the village of Elphinstone in East Lothian".</p></blockquote>
I should like to say more about that particular project. Elphinstone is a small community in East Lothian which has no community facilities whatever, except a small Victorian village school. I will not dwell on that. The reply from the Secretary of State was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The projects for which I gave consent to Lothian regional council for 1980-81 do not include the proposed provision of a temporary community hall in the village of Elphinstone."— 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 February 1981; Vol. 998, c.289.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Secretary of State personally has prevented the provision of that urgently needed facility which the local authority wanted to go ahead with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this indicates that a chaotic situation is developing in Lothian region in the whole field of tendering and arranging contracts for both major and minor capital spending projects on much-needed facilities in the Lothian region. It is self-evident that this situation must be costly. This level of uncertainty must be costing the regional council money, and therefore it is costing the ratepayers of Lothian region money, quite unnecessarily, due to the direct intervention and meddling by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also self-evident that the clause, unless we succeed in doing away with the powers to withdraw which the Minister seeks could make matters considerably worse. Local authorities' capital spending programmes will become very uncertain and precarious undertakings in future years. I wonder whether contractors will want to tender for work for local authorities if this sword of Damocles is to hang over every single minor project. A contractor might tender for a community hall or whatever it might be, might do a great deal of preparatory work on it and might be on the point of starting work, but under the powers which the Minister seeks here that project could be wound up at extremely short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his notes on clauses the Minister tells us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once he has given his consent the Secretary of State does not have the power at present to vary the terms of, or to withdraw, that consent. Clause 23(o) enables him to do so in appropriate circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has not told us anything about what he thinks would be "appropriate circumstances ", and he
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
owes it to the Committee and to the House to give some indication of what they would be. He is seeking power to create chaos in local government capital programmes, and the Committee should take the opportunity presented by these amendments to prevent him from creating that chaos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause, especially the part that we are trying to amend, represents in many respects possibly the worst of all the attacks on local government. If there is anything which local councillors naturally like to complete in their period of office, they will be looking to buildings or schools which they have been involved in. The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) will doubtless tell of the monuments to his political achievements that he would like to see constructed in Perth. He will have that opportunity in the fullness of time, I am sure, if he chooses to take it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great prides that people in local government have always had has been the fact that they had some executive power. I am sure, Mr. Gourlay, that, as one who has far more experience in local government than I, you can look back and say that there was a school here or a project there which you were able to realise in your period of office. The changes which the Government seek to create could well frustrate many legitimate ambitions. We are not talking about building Brasilias in Scotland or anything like that. We are not even talking, in the context of Lothian region, about excessive capital projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made the point that the grand design of the Government's economic policies is to reduce public expenditure and thus reduce inflation. We have, to an extent, seen this being successful in so far as inflation is now within about five points of what it was in June 1979. Whether it will be at that point after the Budget remains to be seen. We are seeing a Government wanting to reduce public expenditure, but at the same time causing dramatically distressing rises in unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point that there are revenue consequences of capital expenditure. It is clear that there is no point in building hospitals if it is not possible to staff them with nurses, that there is no point in building local authority homes if the nurses, social workers and others are not available to provide the support for those living in these homes. It is quite a different matter for the Secretary of State to take upon himself the detailed examination of every project, not because he wants to argue through the case, but simply because he wishes to act in a mean, petty and spiteful way towards one particular authority, as he has been doing in the last financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State now anticipates that he will need wider powers to apply to other local authorities. This is not just another Lothian-bashing clause. It is in anticipation of confrontation with other local authorities. When one considers the difference between the expenditure levels of Lothian and Strathclyde, of Lothian and Borders, of the Western Isles or even the Highlands, one sees that many of these areas will still have fairly high levels of expenditure. There will be pet projects which local authorities wish to push ahead with. We will see vast armies of civil servants interfering in the detailed work of local government. One can only say that perhaps the public expenditure con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
sequences in terms of extra staffing required at St. Andrew's House and elsewhere will far outweigh any savings that the Secretary of State can hope for from the delays in granting capital consents. The disparity may well be such that it could be more costly to have an army of civil servants going through every jot, dot and comma required in consents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see this as a very short-sighted view. We can argue about the consequences in terms of employment and the like, and the general frustrations of the Government's economic policies. Perhaps as an Opposition it is not our responsibility to point that out to the Government. Perhaps we should let them go ahead and continue to make the mess they have already made in the last 20 months. But as Members we have a responsibility to seek to protect our colleagues in local authorities and their rights. We see here one of the most serious diminutions of rights in their capacity to make judgments about what they consider the needs of their area and the capacity of the local people to finance these needs. Always at the end of the day, they take their chances at the polls. If they are slung out, that is a lesson they will learn to their cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a democratic society these considerations lie at the heart of the political process. If one has devolved executive powers it is only fair that these powers be retained. These are not privileges enjoyed by local authorities at the moment, but rights, rights which are part of the social contract on which our democratic society rests. If these rights are taken away, it is a denial of local domocracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that there is a debate, and that we are perhaps only now coming to terms with it, about the rights of local communities and what the Government perceive to be the general health of the country as a whole. But we take the view that existing legislation was more than adequate to meet the special circumstances which my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden mentioned—the vagaries of the winter, the problems that may well arise if we have a speedier completion of contracts than had originally been intended. The existing provisions can cover that. We are talking only about the mean and spiteful approach of the Secretary of State to authorities whose political persuasion and compassion for the people to whom they are responsible is in excess of what the Secretary of State considers reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not want to see the Secretary of State having the power to withdraw. At this point we are prepared to accept that there can be occasions when there is a need to vary. We recognise also that there are occasions when, in all good faith, undertakings are entered into in terms of contracts relating to professional fees. It is difficult in some instances to know the extent of future revenue costs unless one has entered into the detailed examination of what the realisation of councillors' pipedreams may be. Until we know the heating, lighting, and staffing costs of an old people's home, it is irresponsible for the local authority to go ahead. But, in order to do this and to take these decisions, that information must be to hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the advice of architects and surveyors and, I imagine, of lawyers, has to be obtained. Not only does it have to be obtained, but, especially in the case of lawyers—as most of us know to our cost—it has to be paid for. It would be irresponsible of local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
not to seek the advice of professionals and not to seek to have at their disposal the information which would then in many instances determine whether they wanted to go on to the second or the third stage of the development of projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To grant to the Secretary of State powers which we would consider arbitrary is once again a denial of local democracy. It is a denial of access to the information upon which balanced judgments can be made by those who were given the democratic right by the people who took the trouble to vote for them at the elections in preceding years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not simply a matter of the Secretary of State saying "I don't like what you are doing about the rates. Therefore, I will act spitefully and meanly to prevent you from doing anything else". It is a very short-sighted approach, which is preventing local authorities from doing their job in a sensible and realistic manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that we shall have from the Minister the story that it will be all right, that each case will be treated on its merits, that the Government will not be vindictive, that exceptions will be made, and all the rest. But when we start getting all these qualifications, it makes us wonder whether we need the legislation in the first place. If it is not to be applied in the manner that we are suggesting, if we in the Opposition are crying wolf, why do we need it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) pointed out earlier this morning, the trend in Right-wing thinking throughout the world, as exemplified as much by President Reagan as by the Prime Minister, is a desire to get Government off people's backs. But it appears that this Government's approach is to get Government off the backs of the people by putting it onto the backs of local government. As far as we can see, there is no case of logic for this, nor is there any case in justice. What will happen is that local government will be frustrated and local democracy will be hampered and at the end of the day there might be no money or material savings to be made in terms of the overall ambitions of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are a consistent and coherent critique of this part of the clause. The Minister freely admits that he does not want to use the legislation, and does not think that he will really need to use it in many instances. He says that the examples that we are quoting are not really very relevant, and therefore we should not worry. In that case, what is the point of putting in the legislation in the first place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there is an instance at present where the Secretary of State has been unable to convince a local authority of the wisdom of his policies, where it takes on, as it is entitled to do, different policy priorities and where its evidence is that the best interests of the people whom it represents in terms of employment could be fulfilled by carrying on with capital projects. These capital projects will not only be frustrated, in the sense that they might eventually be stopped, but the unemployment in the area would be worse affected by the interruption of capital projects than by other considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that the energies of the chamber of commerce were not directed earlier in the lifetime of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
the Government towards the impact of VAT and high interest rates on unemployment and other aspects of Government policy which I merely point out. It is a rather selective approach to the economic consequences of action by local or central government. For it to be called in aid as evidence of the heinous nature of one authority's policies is to me selective in the extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no hesitation in commending these amendments. We make quite clear our intention to vote on them and to make sure that our opposition to what we regard as one of the grossest interferences in local democracy should not pass without challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 10, line 29, leave out paragraph 	<i>(a).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the second part of clause 23, the Government's proposal that there should be certain changes in the way in which the authorities deal with capital expenses. Under subsection 	<i>(b),</i> which we will come to soon, matters such as leasing contracts are included in the definition of capital expenses. I understand that to be the main import and intention of this new paragraph (3) in section 94 of the Act. However, subsection 	<i>(a),</i> which the amendment seeks to delete, allows the Secretary of State by order to
	<br><blockquote><p>"amend the definition of ' capital expenses' in subsection (2) above ".</p></blockquote>
This will be a world-record short speech. The amendment is down because, as far as I can see, subsection (2) makes no attempt to define "capital expenses". I have not got the text in front of me, but I am sure that one of my hon Friends, or possibly the Minister, will provide it to me. I am obliged. Inter-party co-operation is splendid. Subsection (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section ' capital expenses ' mean any expenses which are to be charged to a capital or borrowing account, or which, being of a capital nature, are to be met otherwise than out of current revenue."</p></blockquote>
That really amounts to saying that capital expenses should be defined as capital expenses and capital expenses are not revenue expenses. A less helpful definition of capital expenses I could not envisage. It takes us not one inch towards understanding what capital expenses are and what should be included under this heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two general approaches to this matter in the local authority world. There are those—probably the majority—who take the view that the less said about
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
the definition of capital expenses, the better. There is nothing more horrific than letting the ingenious and fertile minds of St. Andrew's House run amok in terms of defining what a capital expense actually is. There is nothing more dangerous than being tied down to a form of words which someone at some time might be expected to adhere to. Therefore, they do not wish any more precise definition of capital expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been searching through some of the briefs that I have. I remind the Minister, who, I think, was a member of the authority that I am about to mention, that the Edinburgh town council in its day used to replace its dust carts frequently. That was in the days before there were electric fires, smokeless fuel and suchlike, so that people emptied their buckets in considerable quantities twice a week. In those days the wear and tear on the dust carts of Edinburgh town council was such that they had to be replaced frequently. The Under-Secretary may well have been a member of the cleansing committee or refuse committee council on that authority, and may well be able to give us information on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were led to believe that for purposes of local government finance under Edinburgh town council the purchase of dust carts was considered to be revenue expenditure, not capital. These are clearly major items of expenditure, but as a result of the frequency of their purchase they had apparently to be treated as revenue. I am not sure whether they are so treated by the succeeding authority—Edinburgh district council. Perhaps Members who have closer contact with that authority could elicit the information. The Minister may be able to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend, although there seems to be a certain ingratitude on the Government Benches for this interesting information. It is a good point, and I believe that we shall come to it, particularly when we look at subsection 	<i>(b).</i> We are on subsection (a), but it is relevant to that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point was that there are those who take the view that the less said the better about the definition of capital expenses, but I know some people who argue with some force that that is the advice of despair, and that if the Secretary of State is forced to define capital expenses we shall at least know where we stand, and the Secretary of State and certainly the local authorities will' be tied down to the definition which he decides upon. I do not suggest that the definition that we would be looking for would be remarkable or a hocus-pocus collection of individual items of expenditure such as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
purchase of dust carts, but there is undoubtedly a grey area between what is obviously capital expenditure, though it may have revenue spin-offs like major construction work and so on, right down to the kind of fringe areas which we shall be discussing later and which are attempted to be caught by the new subsection 	<i>(b)</i> in the areas of leasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Under-Secretary has been giving some thought to the definition of capital expenditure in section 94. What is in his mind? He could try to define capital expenses for us. I think that he would be the first to agree that the definition that the Committee heard a few minutes ago is not helpful. We are now being told that he is taking power by order to amend that definition. Can he say whether he intends to use that power? If he does want to use it—I do not want to pin him down specifically—can he explain broadly what kind of definition he thinks would be incorporated in this emendation? It is a matter of considerable interest to local authorities, and it would be helpful if he would spend some time explaining exactly what is in his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own view—I say this as a very preliminary conception—is that it would be better to take out subsection 	<i>(a)</i> and that we should continue to live with the somewhat opaque infelicities of the non-definition
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
that appears in the 1973 Act. It would presumably not preclude the Secretary of State, if he wished, proceeding with the attempt to catch leasing arrangements or other arrangements of a like nature, which is the subject of the latter part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are coming to a natural break, but I hope that I have said enough to catch the Under-Secretary's interest. I do not want him to miss his favourite sports programmes on Saturday, penning a comprehensive list of capital expenses to read out to the Committee, but he owes us an explanation of exactly what is meant by capital expenses at the moment, and how somewhat inadequate definition will change the effect of this subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
