	<p>[Mr. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>" That during the proceedings on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[Mr. 	<i>Alexander Fletcher.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Gourlay. There is a document indicating the documents to be provided for the Committee. There are about 38, plus three miscellaneous. Many of them are not here. I wonder whether they will be provided in due course, or whether we are expected to find them for ourselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for advising me of his point of order. I think that in the circumstances he can leave it to the Chair to discuss the matter with the officials concerned. I think that at least excerpts from the relevant documents might be provided, as has been done on previous occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. May I take this opportunity to tell the Committee that it is the Government's intention to provide supplementary notes to clauses during the course of the Committee's proceedings. The notes on clause 1 should be available now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. May I ask for your guidance on the significance of the fact that the Amendment Paper containing the amendments for discussion, when we eventually reach them, is dated Tuesday 22 July 1980. Should it be 1981 by any chance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How the mistake occurred, I do not know. Certainly, cognisance will be taken of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this Committee's proceedings will be long and happy—as long as possible. Certainly we do not wish them to be rushed through in the way that the Minister would seem to suggest. The Bill is fairly long and complicated. The Minister's suggestion that we meet twice a week is unfortunate, because we feel that a Bill of this nature requires long and careful consideration. At first reading it is virtually unintelligible, in that it seeks to amend the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The manner in which the Bill is framed may well give rise to points of order at a later stage, but I do not propose to go into them now. Suffice it to say that we feel that the omnibus nature of, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
example, the first part of the Bill could well cause problems in stand part debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that it would be preferable to meet once a week, for reasons which I shall outline. First, the Bill is complicated, long and ambitious. It has inspired a great deal of interest, and many of us in the last few weeks have had a great deal of correspondence and discussion with the many pressure groups which have a direct interest in the Bill. It is important that their interests should be put on the record at the first opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why we are not anxious that the Bill should be rushed through is that we do not consider it a matter of urgency. It cannot be implemented, especially in relation to parental choice, in the forthcoming school session. My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—who is out with his tawse belting latecomers in the corridor; I imagine that in keeping with the code of practice their names will be recorded and made available in the Library—and I had a helpful meeting about two weeks ago with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which made it clear that it was unlikely to be able to implement this legislation in the school session of 1981-82. It did not imagine that the Bill would be enacted before July of this year, and we shall certainly endeavour to keep consideration of it going as long as possible. We may well interfere with the grouse shooting of some hon. Gentlemen. [HON. MEMBERS: " Who? "] I have seen grouse on occasions in North Edinburgh. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) has been on the grouse moors at some time in his life—whether falling out of aeroplanes or anything else, I am not sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never in my life participated in shooting animals on the grouse moors, and I have no intention whatever of doing so. Equally, I have no intention of stopping those who wish to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should be clear before we start that, while a debate on the motion before the Committee can be reasonably wide, grouse shooting is far removed from education. I hope that hon. Members will not pursue the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Gourlay. I am sorry that I strayed, but I was endeavouring to put down a kind of timetabling mark-up. The hon. Gentleman and I sat for many long and weary hours on the last Bill. Now we have actually had a disclaimer from him that there is something in the world about which he knows nothing, because he has never been involved in that field of activity. If this sitting has no other consequence, at least we have that on record—that there is something which he has not done and about which he has even less knowledge than he normally displays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that, after that confession from the Conservative Benches of lack of interest in shooting, fishing and so on, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is unlikely to be reselected at the next election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's record in terms of reselection is well known, and we should leave it to the wisdom of the Conservative Party and the electors of Perth and East Perthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the legislation is not to be implemented in the forthcoming school session, we do not need to break our necks trying to get it through. We do not need to rush into pushing through amendments, having debates guillotined, trying to get the whole of this long and complicated Bill through before the local authorities have the opportunity to consider it very seriously. One of the things that has emerged from our discussions is that the local authorities are very worried about certain aspects of the Bill. Obviously this is not the time for me to go into that. But simply to say that they are concerned suggests that, even when the Bill has been discussed in Committee, when it has been to the other place, when it has come back for Report, and even if eventually it receives the Royal Assent in its present form—and we doubt that it will—there are still many problems which the local government administrators will have to seek to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When local authorities are being encouraged—in fact, required—to cut their staffing, to become what is regarded as more efficient, which basically means that they do more work with fewer people, to add to those pressures this additional work at a time when most people in Scotland in the months of July and August are beginning to think about their holidays is an unfair burden to place on the local authorities. I do not think that they will be able to cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, if it is implemented, should be implemented in 1982-83. It will not escape the attention of hon. Members that in 1982 the local government elections at regional level will take place. One of the problems that I have encountered in discussing legislation of this nature has been the question of who has the mandate to determine policy. By that I mean that a Government are elected and have rights over the whole of the United Kingdom. I am not one of those people who maintain that because the Conservatives do not have a majority of seats in Scotland they do not have the right to govern. But what I do believe is that when they seek to impinge on the rights of local authorities they must seriously consider the feelings of the local authority electors. These feelings are best tested at local government elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the arguments that was advanced at great length before you, Mr. Gourlay, on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill was that we believed that the obligation on local authorities to sell council houses would be better tested at the ballot boxes in the district elections than by the diktat of a Scottish Office Minister. We feel that the controversial nature of some parts of this Bill would be far better tested at the ballot box in May 1982, when the elected representatives on the regional authorities which have the responsibility in the main for implementing this legislation will seek the mandate of their electors, and hopefully get approval, as far as the Labour authorities are concerned, for the right to refuse to participate in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Having said that 1982-83 is early enough for the legislation to be implemented, I now turn to some of the reasons why we should like to slow down the process of the Committee, not to delay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the numbers game is such that the only way in which we can stop this is to allow the Bill to go through very quickly. Therefore, the opposite is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) wants to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always prepared to give way to the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), if he has anything to say, but I realise that giving way does not mean that he has anything to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the Bill, I take first the area of parental choice, which has evoked a great deal of interest from various groups. I have seen various communications. The parents, as represented by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, had a meeting with me yesterday in Edinburgh which was very helpful. Their anxieties about certain aspects of the Bill were made clear and they expressed the desire for further consultation as legislation progresses. At the same time we had discussions with the Scottish Consumer Council, which also has an interest in this part. Both bodies think that there is much for this Committee to consider. The present notes on clauses and general information do not adequately deal with the problem. For example, the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council is engaged in a survey covering all the Scottish regions and local authorities which provide education. Prospectuses are published by individual schools, and information which I imagine lies at the heart of the parental choice part of the Bill is being surveyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sensible and reasonable discussion of the parents' charter depends upon the opportunities available to the parents for consideration of what is open to their children. We contend that this survey will show that legislation is not required, because most local authorities and schools already produce parents' notes or school prospectuses, merely annually updating them. This is one area of the Bill where the information at our disposal will be gravely deficient. I shall be delighted if the Minister has information in addition to that provided by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, although I suspect that at this stage he will not, because I doubt whether he would seek to duplicate the activities of that estimable organisation. So on the basis of two meetings yesterday morning it is fair to say that in that particular area there is much concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association is coming to meet the Labour group and, I imagine, Conservative Back Benchers as well. If the experience I have already had with the Educational Institute of Scotland is anything to> go by, the discussions will necessitate further consideration of the Bill and further meetings in Scotland. The teachers' unions, the Parent-Teacher Council, the Consumer Council, local authorities, and in some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
instances individual schools, are all interested in the detailed implementation of the Bill. Many of us have engaged in extensive consultations with individual schools in our constituencies to discover how they would be affected by the problems arising from parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to say is that one of the problems of being a Scottish Member is that there is only a limited amount of time available to be in one's constituency or in Scotland, and this process of consultation which is vital in considering legislation of this nature cannot be conducted on any day other than Monday or Friday. If hon. Members have to spend a fair amount of time on Mondays and Fridays in Scotland, it is essential that the rest of the week is as free as possible to prepare for this Committee and to get on with the rest of the work of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that within this Committee there are a number of members of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, who have undertaken an onerous task on behalf of the House. It involves a great deal of reading, and many formal sessions, which I know hon. Members take very seriously. As one who has served on the Committee for a year, I know the effort and attention which is put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do that job effectively requires at least two meetings a week and many hours of reading and research. In order to do that, membership of this Committee will have to be less committed or even take second place. This is most regrettable, because the Select Committee procedure is a most interesting and exciting development. I know that it is not new, but the manner in which it has been dealt with since the initiative taken by the former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has given additional work to individual Members, who, as we all know, do not have anything like the resources they require. As we have a large Select Committee, and many of its members are also members of this Standing Committee, it would be unfortunate if we were to overload already overburdened Back Benchers on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government's desire to push through as much legislation as possible will require some of my colleagues and some Conservative Members to leave this Committee to go elsewhere for votes on the Forestry Bill and other Bills. This makes for the possibility of bad legislation. If Members are not able to follow the debates and to understand the complicated questions which arise, because they are elsewhere, they will on occasions not be in full possession of the facts when a decision has to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the special educational needs part of the Bill. Here we are seeking the welcome implementation of at least part of the Warnock report. I shall not go into its merits now, but I point out that there is a Special Standing Committee at present investigating the English Education Bill, which is, in effect, the implementation of Warnock. As far as I can see, the Committee is doing a first-class job looking at the implications of the Bill, taking evi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
dence and generally seeking to work through in legislative terms the implications of those parts of Warnock to which the Government are prepared to give effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt my hon. Friend, who is doing a marvellous job. I have noticed that one or two Conservative Members are leaving the Committee, which seems rather strange on first sitting. My hon. Friend mentioned the Warnock report. Will he note that no copies of the report are available for the Committee? It is important that we have copies of the report available from the outset, so that we can study it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that point has been taken on board. In my cursory glance at the table on which documents are to be found I realised that it was not quite the heaving table that it usually is in terms of the literature available. To that extent I was grateful, but it is very important that we have copies of Warnock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be drawn to the attention of the Committee that the Warnock report has been available to hon. Members from the Vote Office from the time of publication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. In my understanding, it is clearly laid down in Standing Orders and the rules governing Committees that if the Government refer to an official document they have a responsibility to provide that document on the table. I must submit, with great respect, that it would be a very dangerous precedent to say at this stage of our proceedings that the onus is on hon. Members to seek to secure these documents for themselves. It is clearly laid down, and we have had a recent ruling on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct. There is an obligation on the Government to provide the necessary documents, but I would have thought that in a debate of this kind, when Members knew that they would be on this Committee, and would require time to study the Warnock report, they would have made sure of getting it before they came to the Committee. However, the Minister will no doubt have taken note of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for those remarks, Mr. Gourlay, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) for drawing the matter to the attention of the Committee. It might also be of assistance if we had copies of the Official Report of the Special Standing Committee proceedings on the English Education Bill, which is the implementation of Warnock. If we go more slowly, when that Special Standing Committee completes its work we can look at its views. It is in many respects reacting to legislation similar to that which we shall have to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is net merely the Warnock report that we have to consider in. respect of the special educational needs. Probably of all areas this is the one which will evoke the greatest interest, and in some respects
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the least controversy. I do not think that there is a tremendous divide between the two sides of the Committee on this issue. There is always the consideration that the Government, in their normal parsimonious manner, are not prepared to put their money where their mouth is. Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that it will be possible for some very progressive legislation to be enacted in respect of special educational needs. The people most affected—or at least the parents most affected—will be those who take the greatest interest in the Special Standing Committee. I hope that the Minister will also take a great interest in this, when he resumes his seat, or in fact when any member of the Government Front Bench resumes his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for the entire Government Front Bench to be absent during a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. It is a matter for the Ministers concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very disrespectful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) was being disrespectful. I have known him for some years, and I know that he has many failings of a political nature, but not of manners. He also happens to support the same football team as I, which I regard as a great source of embarrassment, because normally the supporters are men of considerable judgment. I can go on perhaps at a later stage about the fortunes of Hibernian football team; it may come up under special educational needs. Members of the team might even benefit from the assisted places scheme. They are about the only people in Scotland who could benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my point, of all the groups which are interested in the Bill, probably the people who will watch it most closely are the parents of the youngsters whose needs we would like to think will be covered by the implementation of War-neck. Already we have had a great deal of communication and discussion with interested parental groups dealing with the disabled and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point because I feel that it is not enough for us to listen to the parents, to read the documentation and to read the responses which they have made and to listen to the organisations which seek to help them. We must also try to get out into the highways and byways of Scotland to find out what is going on in the institutions which require more assistance and a greater degree of support. I take two examples from my own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Laurencehill Academy in Alloa, there is a unit which has been operating since the early 1970s where mentally handicapped children are involved in the education process. There are many exciting developments there. It is one of the integrated units which Warnock looks towards as being something of an ideal in the longer term. I spent part of Friday in this school, and I am hoping to go back to my old job and do a bit of teaching in this unit in the near future. I have already
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
spoken to some of the teachers involved, but I want to see, as a practitioner, exactly what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that every hon. Member will want to undertake that type of work in every aspect of the Committee's activities. Nevertheless it is most important that we try to find out what is happening in what are, to all intents and purposes, the shadowy areas of our society, the forgotten twilight zones into which we ought to be putting heat and light. There is a great responsibility on the members of the Committee to appreciate fully the extent to which tremendous work is being done under great difficulty at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a valid point. Parliamentarians often forget that another world exists outside. It is certainly worth while for all parliamentarians from time to time to go from this place among ordinary people. Only this week I visited Crookedholm primary school, a small village school in my constituency. I must confess that until I was invited to attend I did not even know of its whereabouts, so remote is the school. I was horrified to find that the school, which is 161 years old, was in a very dilapidated condition. The small staff there were excellent. May I extend an invitation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman appears to be making a speech rather than an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a speech Mr. Gourlay. I am glad that you have given me some guidance. I am somewhat inexperienced in Committees. This is the first major Scottish Committee in which I have had the opportunity to speak, and I hope that I may have your kind indulgence. You are a kind man. If I make mistakes, I am sure that you will guide me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I wanted to make was that the teachers, when asked about the Bill, were completely opposed to it. We ought to go among such people—not wait for their submissions, but consult them. I think that that was the point which my hon. Friend made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to the fact that he is new to Committees. Perhaps I should indicate that interventions are intended to be short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take on board my hon. Friend's point. I agree that we must listen to what teachers say. I have to do it most of the time that I am at home, because my wife is a teacher. It is important that we find out in this highly specialised area what the parents and the teachers think about the proposals. In many instances we are not able to find out what the children think about it because they are not capable of making the points that their parents can make so effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I illustrate that point with another example in my constituency, where there is a specialist unit for those requiring special attention—namely, Struan House in Alloa, which deals with the problem of autism. Of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
all the forms of mental handicap, that is probably the most difficult to deal with, although it can be assisted. It is one which, because of its difficult nature, requires a great deal of assistance and understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to examine the Bill fairly and fully, we shall have to spend a great deal of time in our constituencies getting about and meeting people. In respect of our responsibilities as members of the Committee, it is vital that we should have the opportunity to do that. For that reason, we should meet only once a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier in general terms our responsibilities and obligations to other Committees. I should also point out—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MR. CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problems that affect Scottish Members are such that we should want to be here as often as we can be. The obligations which membership of the Committee place on us require us to get around Scotland to an extent that even the most assiduous Members do not at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to meet once a week, on which day should we meet? I am not moving a formal amendment—I wait to hear the views of my colleagues—but I favour Thursday. If there is no three-line Whip on a Monday evening, it is not uncommon for Members to come down overnight on Monday or by the first flight on Tuesday morning. This winter the weather has been clement, and I do not recall any cancellations of early morning flights. But that run of good luck cannot be depended upon, and there could be difficulty in getting to the Committee on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already seen the problems which arise for Conservative members of the Committee. Sometimes they cannot be here because of proceedings elsewhere, because of the weight of business, or because they do not want to be here. But their absence may well be due to travelling difficulties. They may be exhausted. I shall not comment. Certainly Tuesday morning sittings can be awkward, and it would be preferable to meet on Thursdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursdays we probably have less extra business. I have in front of me that very helpful publication, 	<i>The House Magazine</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. PETER FRASER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Fraser. I hope that you will have a long and happy stay in that position, and that if any votes are taken you will remember that you cannot vote on instruction but may, on occasion, follow your conscience. We are very pleased to see you there, Mr. Fraser. It is encouraging that the burden and responsibility of the Chairmanship be spread around as many Members as possible. I have always fancied my chance, but I have never been offered it. Therefore, it is with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
certain sense of envy that I welcome you to the Chair.</p>
	<p>Looking at that estimable publication, 	<i>The House Magazine,</i> one is immediately impressed by the range and scope of the activities which go on in the House. Apart from the legislation which the House has the responsibility of enacting, there is a variety of other activities in which hon. Members have an opportunity to meet together on an all-party basis to listen to experts and to make visits, the better to equip themselves for the responsibility of governing the country. Given the wide range of activities and opportunities which are open to Members, and given the significance of these opportunities to assist them to do their job better, it is very important that we seek to lighten the legislation load on Members.</p>
	<p>Because of the complicated nature of this legislation, we need a great deal of assistance and advice from specialised groups. There are some very contentious clauses and amendments. I had a telephone call this morning from the EIS, my trade union, drawing to my attention an amendment in respect of teachers' rights on employment and dismissal arrangements. This amendment to schedule 9 has been floated by COSLA, the employers' side. It could have far-reaching effects on the professional status of teachers. It could deny teachers the professional status which is afforded to groups such as doctors and other people who are responsible not merely to' their employers but to their professional bodies, such as the British Medical Association and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.</p>
	<p>I shall not go into the merits of this matter, because I do not know enough about the amendment, but this morning I had an anxious telephone call from a senior member of the staff of the EIS, pointing out that this had come like a Trojan horse in the night for the possible consideration of the Committee. He was most concerned that we look at it and have discussions about it. As one who is not merely a Member of this House but a member of the teacher trade union in question, I have grave misgivings about it. I will not discuss its merits. Suffice it to say that I shall want to know a great deal more about it. I shall have to speak to COSLA; I shall have to speak to the EIS. My colleagues will wish to do likewise, in order the better to inform themselves.</p>
	<p>That is a bombshell which blew up this morning. I suspect that as we go through the Bill there will be more. We have already heard on the grapevine that the Ministers propose to add new clauses. We are grateful for the undertaking by the Minister to provide us with notes on clauses, which are always very helpful. They can serve to concentrate the mind and cut down on irrelevant discussion. Nevertheless, until we have them we are not in a position to test how relevant our discussion may be, apart from the normal conventions of the Chair.</p>
	<p>The Opposition may well table new clauses. My hon. Friends the Members for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and for West Stirlingshire and I have sought to' add to the Bill the education provisions of the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Bill. We did so in the knowledge that there has already been a debate, though not a particularly illuminating debate. It was, in fact, rather embarrassing, because the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) spoke for 50 to 60 minutes from the Front Bench in what can only be called a disgraceful filibuster to scupper legislation on a Private Members' Bills day.</p>
	<p>We would like this to be considered fully. We believe that there are other new clauses coming through. We would like to think that the opportunity will be available for consideration of these clauses, for discussion of their merits, for the consultative processes which to say the educational lobby in Scotland requires of us.</p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>This is not a Bill that we wish to go into at all. We feel that in the main it is unnecessary. Most of the proposals, apart from those relating to War-nock, are unnecessary, because the provisions are operating satisfactorily at present. In that respect I refer to parental choice and the zoning question. We would also find in some areas—for example, the closing of denominational and non-denominational schools—that there is a general feeling that it is better to leave things as they are and not try to disturb a potentially very difficult situation.</p>
	<p>We feel that the assisted places scheme will affect only a small number of people, that it will cause distortion in our education system and a great deal of anxiety. The strange thing is that it is legislation that nobody seems to want. No one has given any stamp of approval to it. In general, the legislation is either unnecessary or irrelevant.</p>
	<p>We do not start consideration of the Bill with any enthusiasm for it, apart from that area concerning special educational needs. Even there we are disgusted by the Government's hypocritical attitude. They make fine-sounding noises but will not provide the funds to make their ideals a reality. The hypocrisy of that part of the Bill is most regrettable. We will certainly seek in a constructive way to provide criticism of that section and to firm up the Government's financial intentions.</p>
	<p>I keep coming back to the nature of this legislation and the attention which it is receiving in Scotland. The anxieties being expressed there suggest to us that we should not be moving too quickly and that it would be preferable for us to deal with this Bill very slowly. We have already proven that there is no great need for the legislation to be hurried through, because it will not have effect this year. Those areas which are controversial could well be tested at the ballot box. That is where legislation affecting the rights of local authorities to determine their own priorities should be tested.</p>
	<p>We recognise that when a Government have been elected with a majority in the United Kingdom, they have the power to carry legislation which is by and large consistent throughout the United Kingdom. While conceding that, we do not think that the rights which have been enjoyed by local authorities should be taken away without the electors within those
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
local authorities' areas having an opportunity to express a view.</p>
	<p>I have spoken for a few minutes, and do not propose to go on much longer. I know that many of my colleagues wish to make additional points. I appeal to the Minister, who is not a totally unreasonable man—at times he may well be excessive, but not unreasonable. I should like to think that he is a man who is very busy at this time. I do not intend to overpersonalise in this debate, but he is responsible for education and industry. We imagine that that means not just creating unemployment but attempting the reduction of unemployment. He has been very successful in the former, but not so successful the latter. Where success has been evident it has not always been attributable to his good efforts, but I appreciate that he has a strong commitment to arrest the decline in the Scottish economy—</p>
	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems ridiculous that the Government cannot evince any more interest in the proceedings, in that so many hon. Members have to leave the room. It is clear that this legislation does not have the interest, support and backing of Conservative hon. Members. The Under-Secretary with responsibility for education and industry in Scotland has too much to do to be here two mornings a week listening to this. If I thought that he would appreciate it I would give him a far better speech but I do not see why I should cast pearls—I leave it there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy is in disarray. The country's industrial base has been almost completely eroded. What is left is crumbling, and the Minister comes here with this tottery Bill, seeking to improve parental choice, to give parents the chance to send their children to school, but then forgets that when these children leave school they will have no choice as to where they will work, as there will be no jobs available. If there is a priority for this Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with the general line taken by my hon. Friend. Would he not agree, however, that the proposal put by the Minister for the sittings of this Committee might benefit the economy of Scotland as a whole if it managed to keep the Minister tied up here rather than operating in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, although the damage which the Minister can do to the Scottish economy could be modified if he had more time to look at it and to seek alternative ways of dealing with it. I know that the Prime Minister has already changed course on several questions, and one hopes that the road to Damascus and possible conversion is not excluded from the Under-Secretary. The Opposition feel that the hon. Member would be better employed, even if he is one of the few in Scotland who are employed, trying to improve the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
health of the Scottish economy, and trying to restore confidence in our industry, than in simply bringing forward irrelevant, unnecessary and often hypocritical proposals, the like of which are in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now certain that we want to- meet only once a week, on Thursday. I was not sure at the beginning, but the force of my own logic has now convinced me that Thursday would be the best day to sit, probably from 10.30 am to 1 pm, on the understanding that if the industrial and economic crisis deepens in Scotland we should be prepared to sacrifice a meeting and have fortnightly sittings in order that the Minister may better employ his time repairing the damage of the past 20 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you for your courtesy as Chairman, Mr. Fraser. I hope that your stay in that position will be long and fruitful, and that the fact that you are in the Chair will give us the opportunity, if we ever reach the stage of discussing the amendments, to win one or two of them although it is significant that probably the most reasonable Conservative Back Bencher is the one chosen to take the Chair. Thank you for your forbearance, Mr. Fraser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would prefer to meet on Thursdays—perhaps once a week, perhaps once a fortnight—as the economic and industrial circumstances for which the Minister is also responsible develop in the weeks and months ahead in which we shall be discussing this legislation in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Fraser. I noticed when you took the Chair that a shiver of fear ran up the backs of your Front Bench colleagues as they realised that your promotion, so young and so early, to such a high position was a major threat to them. They were obviously very concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Committee should meet on only one morning a week, though, in some disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), I think that Tuesday morning might be more suitable. I do not think that many of us would be happy if we sat on Thursday morning and then on Thursday afternoon as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden that Scottish Ministers have been placing upon the Chair, on the only Chairman that we have had during the proceedings on the four major pieces of Scottish legislation in 20 months, is in many ways intolerable. Mr hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) has sat in the Chair on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill, and the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Only last Thursday morning he finished the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. He also chaired one other minor Bill dealing with legal provisions at the end of the last Session. That is a major task to ask any Chairman to undertake in a Parliament of this nature. My hon. Friend is not a young man, and I think that it would be of some benefit to him if we were to meet on only one morning a week. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Ravensbourne (Mr. Hunt) has been placed in the Chair as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>Mr. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair</i>.]</p>
	<p>I am glad that you are back in the Chair, Mr. Gourlay, though sorry that you were not here earlier. I have been saying complimentary things about you, which I am sure would have had the most profound effect upon the way in which you will listen to my speeches during the rest of this sitting.</p>
	<p>I had been making the point, Mr. Gourlay, that you have had an onerous task over the past 20 months in terms of the passage of Scottish legislation. I was suggesting, therefore, that to meet on only one morning a week on this Bill would remove some of the burden from you. I appreciate that yours is a very difficult task, and that you are interested in everything else that goes on in Scotland and want to take part in other matters as well.</p>
	<p>I was making the point that the hon. Member for Ravensbourne had been placed in the Chair on this Committee as well. But I appreciate that with your conscientiousness, Mr. Gourlay, you will wish to play as large a part as possible in the Chair. Whatever attributes the hon. Member for Ravensbourne may have, I am sure that a knowledge of the Scottish education system is not one and that therefore, with your knowledge, you will wish to be in the Chair as often as possible, giving the hon. Member for R.avensbourne an opportunity only occasionally. From that point of view it would be beneficial to you, Mr. Gourlay, if we were to meet on only one morning in the week.</p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>That would also be of some benefit to the Ministers themselves. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), the ether Minister concerned, has not, so far as I know, any great knowledge of the Scottish education system. He is not the Minister with responsibility for it. I assume that he is doing some back-up work, and the more time we can give him for that the better.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) has enormous responsibilities, not just for education but for industry. As my hon. Friend said, the Scottish economy is collapsing round our ears, and more particularly round his ears. Yet he is to be tied up in this Committee for two mornings a week, and I assume that if we do not make fairly rapid progress he will demand even more time. He ought to be dealing with the problems of Lin-wood and trying to find orders for companies in extreme difficulties, such as Weirs in my constituency. That should be his major task—not sitting here dealing with what is essentially an irrelevant measure, which could be dealt with at a much more leisurely pace.</p>
	<p>This is the fourth major Committee with which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), the Government Whip, has had to deal, in addition to one minor Committee. He is a man who takes responsibilities seriously. I have heard that some of his colleagues think that he takes them rather too seriously, and that he worries too much about them. I should be happy to see some of those worries lifted from his bowed shoulders. Every
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
time that I see him he seems to be more bent forward with the weight of responsibility. I should be happy if some of that could be taken off him by our sitting on only one morning a week. That would allow him to discipline his Members a litde more effectively man he has this morning and keep enough of them here to form a quorum.</p>
	<p>The other Conservative Members would also have a problem—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are thin on the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that they are not here that often. We have 44 Scottish Members, and we can share the responsibilities of these Committees. The Conservatives have only 10 or 11 Scottish Back Benchers, and if there have to be eight on a Committee, they are a bit pushed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come on these Committees, Mr. Gour-lay, as I am sure you notice more than anybody else, we find the same faces—I will not say " old face ", because I accept that many of them are quite young—day in, day out. We ought to have some respect for them and for their work load—although I do not often feel that—and perhaps meet on only one morning a week, so that they have a little less burdensome task to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my experience on the Committees dealing with the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill and the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill of the number of contributions made by Government Members perhaps makes my plea about their overwork slightly incorrect. There were occasions when I felt that if the Government had managed to find very good wax dummies and set them in their seats for the whole of the Committee stage, one would have found difficulty in noticing the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Conservative Members, besides serving on all these Committees—I do not think that anyone has served en all of them, but all of them will have served on three by the end of this Bill—serve on the Select Committee. I myself am on the Select Committee. As the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr Stewart) is aware, we are about to undertake a major step on the question of youth unemployment in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more relevant piece of educational legislation would have been a scheme to implement a comprehensive post-school education system other than what is contained in the Bill. The Select Committee is undertaking the task of looking at youth unemployment and employment training programmes. It will be a large task. One gets a large box from the Select Committee and it is already full with papers, though the papers are not yet all in. So those of us who are on that Select Committee have a major task to perform in terms of sifting through all that material, making ourselves well informed and being able to ask the relevant questions of the various people whom we shall interview during cur investigation. That investigation is likely to cover a period similar to the work of this Committee. It would be beneficial for those of us who are members of the Select Committee if we could operate on the basis of only one morning a week rather than the two proposed at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Much of the Bill is irrelevant. It is unimportant in terms of its impact upon Scottish education. To many of us it is a piece of downright hypocrisy that the Government can bring forward such legislation at a time when they are slashing expenditure on education throughout Scotland. In my own area a headmistress told me recently that if the present proposals for Strathclyde region education per capita expenditure went through she would have 4p per day per pupil to spend in her school. As she rightly and graphically put it, she will have to spend on books and material under half of what most of her children bring to buy a packet of crisps in the school. That is the real impact that the Government are having on education in Scotland; it is not the irrelevancies that are contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Government were prepared to argue that what is in the Bill is relevant, it is in no way urgent. I do not think that there is a single matter in the Bill which could possibly be implemented and come into force in time for the next school session. As my hon. Friend said, we are talking about August-September 1982 at the earliest before this legislation can come into effect. Therefore, there is no great need to rush through it, because it dees not really matter—even the part which might be said to have some immediacy, the part on the negotiating machinery for teachers and post-school education lecturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point about post-school education lecturers, rather than the phrase used in the Bill, " further education lecturers ", because further education lecturers are a very specific group, and the term does not cover the whole group which will be included in the legislation. Even that part is now largely irrelevant until at least January or February of next year, because the major group, the Scottish teachers, have already settled their pay av/ard for this year, through until 1 April 1982. The pay figures have already been settled, and therefore the new machinery dees not need to come into force until then. There is no great urgency even for that part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need, however, perhaps for the Government more than the Opposition, to do something about consultation in terms of the provisions on the trade unions' new negotiating machinery. I was formerly very much concerned with the negotiating machinery from 1973 onwards, and with the Houghton report, from which this part comes. I hope that the Houghton report will be available in the room at the end of the day. It came out in late December 1975 and was discussed in January 1976. Immediately afterwards, certain civil servants, some of whom are present, issued requests to the relevant trades unions and other organisations for their views on new negotiating machinery. Many of us sent in our views. That was the last we heard of the matter. There have been no meetings as far as I am aware, at least between the union I know best—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to suggest that there is a need for consultation, Mr. Gourlay. There has been no consultation between the Government and the trade unions on new negotiating machinery, and yet it is in the Bill. If we could sit for only one morning a week, that would give us an opportunity to consult the trade unions and enable the Government and their advisers to consult the trade unions and the employers on whether the Bill as it stands is what they want, and whether they can reach agreement beforehand which can be included in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is an irrelevant Bill, it is no contradiction to say that it is also complicated. It covers wide areas, and therefore it takes us some time to read the reports and various previous measures to which it refers. It requires us to consult large numbers of bodies, and to do that we need more time, so we should sit for only one morning each week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give one small example of the complexity of the Bill and the way in which it is put together. On Second Reading the Secretary of State for Scotland made a half-sentence reference to clause 16 as a minor piece of legislation. I have looked at it carefully and regard it as being far from a minor piece of legislation. It could be a profound piece of legislation. Clauses which are being treated by the Government as minor must be looked at in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to have more time to examine the Bill clause by clause in detail over a long period, after consulting people who are knowledgeable on the subject. Therefore, I support my hon. Friend in suggesting one morning sitting per week. We have some disagreement about which morning it should be, but I take his point about Tuesday mornings. I myself came down on a sleeper overnight, and as is my wont on a sleeper I took a Mogodon, which takes about three hours in the morning to wear off. This may be obvious from my speech. In some respects Thursday mornings are even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's comments. If we were to allocate one Thursday per week for discussion of the Bill it would be more than adequate. I have several reasons for saying this. First, at my frequent surgeries the vast number of complaints do not reflect an interest in parental choice. So far I have had no particular questions raised about this. Most of the complaints are about the effects of unemployment, which are severely felt all over Scotland. In my area in particular there is an intolerable level of 15 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member confirm that he has never had a complaint from any of his constituents and that they are all delighted with the standard of education received by their children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, neither have I had any submissions that they are delighted. In fact, the reverse is the case. The hon. Member draws my attention to the point that when I do receive complaints about
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
education facilities they are about the effects of the cutbacks as a result of Government policies which are affecting those parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier intervention I said that I had visited Crookedholm primary school, and I confessed that I knew naught of its location until I received the invitation to address the 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds on the workings of Parliament. When I saw the dilapidated state of the school I was much concerned. I spoke to the very young teachers and to the young headmaster about the conditions in which they had to operate. They explained to me that the local village very much wished to retain its autonomy over the education of the children and had sought the parental choice of keeping the children at this school, despite its dilapidated condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The true answer of these people, if they were given absolute freedom of choice, would be that they want to retain in that village a primary school for the children. They would much rather see this antiquated Crookedholm primary school demolished and a new unit built, but no funds for that purpose are available from the education authorities because of the Government's cutback policies. So we are talking about freedom, and we really mean freedom. I should like to argue on behalf of my constituents in the village of Crookedholm for them to have the absolute freedom to continue to send their children to a new and modern Crookedholm primary school. I am sure that the teachers, who are very conscientious in that area and who work under intolerable conditions, would agree. So the question of parental choice does not arise at my surgery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to intervene in the hon. Gentleman's first contribution to this debate, but he is arguing a case which can be made at a later stage. That is not permissible under the motion now before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your assistance, for which I am always grateful. You are right to bring that to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general at my surgeries I do not have such cases coming up. Under these circumstances it seems to me ludicrous that we should sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays of every week to discuss a Bill the provisions of which could not become effective during the present school terms. We should be attending to more serious business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Committees at present sitting take up the time of various members of this Committee. Members will be to-ing and fro-ing because of their other commitments. Under these circumstances it seems to me, even as a new Member, that we are placing far too much importance on a Bill which does not seem to have the support of the authorities outside. If there are knowledgeable educational bodies outside which are supporting the Bill, I have yet to hear of them. All the many submissions which I have received as a Scottish Member and not particularly as a member of this Committee—even prior to my being selected to serve on the Committee—are opposed to one or two parts of the Bill or in some cases are totally opposed to the Bill. I should like
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
to see a balance between those informed bodies outside which support elements of this Bill and those which do not. To date I have not heard from anyone who finds anything worth supporting. Therefore, we should support the idea of not spending too much valuable time on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know exactly how my hon. Friend feels. As a new member on the Committee dealing with the British Aerospace Bill I had to rely on a Chairman who, like you, Mr. Gourlay, had great experience in the House, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Sir D. Kaberry). He looked after me en that Bill, and I am certain that my hon. Friend can look to you for guidance and protection. That is the most important thing about a Committee such as this, Mr. Gourlay. I do not want to delay the proceedings, but it is important for my hon. Friend to know that when he gets into difficulty, and if Conservative hon. Members manage to avoid the eyes of their Whip and attack him, he can look to you for protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope, Mr. Gourlay, that you will be as generous as Sir Donald Kaberry was with me as a new member on the British Aerospace Bill, and that you will allow my hon. Friend a certain amount of latitude while bringing him back into order when necessary. I am quite certain that my hon. Friend can rely on your good judgment and protection. If my hon. Friend, who has been selected by the House to this Committee, is to be allowed to make a con tribution, he may well have to rely on your guidance and protection. I also hope, Mr. Gourlay, that your protection will extend to other members of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point about Scottish education. Perhaps the most important protection that you can give, as Chairman, Mr. Gourlay, is to see that Scottish education is looked after while we go through this unnecessary Bill. The most relevant points that have been made this morning have been made from the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to see whether there are any comments from any Conservative Back Benchers. I know that it is difficult sometimes for them to make comments, because they spend more time outside the Committee room than in it. But I imagine that, if they really tried, the Whip might just allow them to speak. I know, Mr. Gourlay, that you would not accept that the Whip is in any way silencing Conservative hon. Members or that he is making any effort to keep them quiet. I know that if you discovered that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was attempting to interfere in any way with the right of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to speak on the Bill, you would immediately afford to the hon. Member the protection that you would undoubtedly afford to me and to my hon. Friends if the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) were to attempt to silence us in any way. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where is he?"]. My hon. Friend is a very hard man, particularly on education matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I am sure that hon. Members will discover as the Bill proceeds that my hon. Friend is a hard and difficult man to push off. He is much concerned about education in Scotland. If Conservative hon. Members attempt in any way to bulldoze the Bill through the Committee—you, Mr. Gourlay, will obviously ensure that they do not succeed—my hon. Friend will also make certain that they are not allowed to proceed with the Bill at a pace which does not allow Opposition Members the time to make the necessary points on behalf of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the interesting things about this morning's discussion has been the number of comments made from a sedentary position by Conservative Members. If we were to meet one day a week, on Thursday mornings, that would lead to a more congenial atmosphere. We are dealing with matters that require a congenial atmosphere if we are to proceed. The Opposition feel very angry about the assisted places scheme, but if from the outset we were to establish a congenial atmosphere in the Committee under your Chairmanship, Mr. Gourlay, I am certain that we could encourage Conservative hon. Members to listen to the argument and accept that there is no need for certain clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does concern me is the determination of Conservative Members, despite all their other responsibilities, to insist that this Committee meet on Tuesdays and Thursday. Like many others on the Opposition Benches, I am very concerned that a number of Members on both sides of the Committee are members of other Committees. My hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) will shortly be concerned about the fishing industry. I know that he has always had a great interest in fishing in Scotland. He is anxious to proceed with fishing matters on behalf of the people of Scotland. It would be unfair to him if we had to hurry away from the discussions on fishing, a matter which is vital to many of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those involved in the fishing industry will accept my next comment in the way in which I make it. I believe that education is more important than fishing. I understand that without a fishing industry we might not be able to afford the education system, but education has the priority. I hope that you will ensure, Mr. Gourlay, that my hon. Friend is not impeded from carrying out his responsibilities to the fishing industry and that at the same time that will not affect his ability to be in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the Committee should not meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Conservative Members always insist, both in the Chamber and in Committee, that they are concerned about the Scottish economy and that they have the fishermen's interests at heart, despite the fact that on the day when there was an attack on employment in Scotland, with the closure of Talbot, we saw their concern for fishing. Rather than fighting for Scottish industry in the Chamber, the Secretary of State for Scotland was fighting for fishing somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
That may not have much relevance to this Committee, but it shows that some education is required by hon. Gentlemen if they are to grasp the fundamental fact that unless we educate our young people, an deducate them even after they have left school, there will be no fishing industry to defend. It would be much better for the Committee to meet only on Thursday mornings. That would allow all Members to continue with their other responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's great interest in fishing. It has just dawned on me that my grandmother used to say that eating fish helped one's brains, so the two matters are not altogether unrelated. The needs of the fishing industry may well complement those of the education service. If children could eat more fish, they would have more brains, and if they had more brains we would have a better education service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again we are getting somewhat away from the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you once again for your helpful intervention, Mr. Gourlay. I was concerned about how I should reply to my hon. Friend. One of the things that concern me—as no doubt it concerns him—about education in Scotland is the need to provide the correct atmosphere and environment for children. One of the ways in which we would attempt to create that atmosphere and that environment would be to see that the school day involved all activities, including school meals. I hope that, for the benefit of Scottish fishermen, fish will be high en the menu for school meals. I hope that the children will get their fair share of fish and that that fish will come from Scottish boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to see that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is with us now. I know of his great interest in fishing, and I am certain that at some stage during the Committee's proceedings he also will wish to participate in other activities in the House on other Bills. He may well be assisting my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire in the official interest that he will soon take up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to this Committee, if there is to be a meaningful debate on Scottish education, that we proceed in an orderly and slow manner, to ensure that we do not make mistakes which we shall have to correct at some time in the future. Consultation is one of the prime considerations in the view of Opposition Members. I agree with all my hon. Friends who believe that consultation has not taken place to the extent that we would wish to see. After clauses 3 and 4, on special educational needs, and clause 5, on the assisted places scheme, clause 6 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consultation on, and consent for, changes in certain educational matters".</p></blockquote>
The word "consultation" is there. If we are to meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and we are to try to cram into the little time that we may have between Tuesdays and Thursdays our other responsibilities in the House—whether they be Select
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Committees, other Committees on fishing or any other item—it will not allow us the necessary time to have consultation with the various interested groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that clause 16 is not minor legislation, though the Government and the Minister may think that it is. The fact that these comments have been made suggest to me that consultation has not taken place. I certainly wish to impress upon the Committee the need to slow the proceedings down. Opposition Members have made it quite clear that this Bill is not urgent. We must keep saying it. There is nothing in the Bill which can become effective until the school session 1982-83. Therefore, there is no need to proceed at a pace which dees not allow for consultation. We should think very carefully before we proceed at such a pace with this motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have been on a number of Committees, I am a little concerned about the following note on the Amendment Sheet:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Amendments have been arranged in the order to be proposed by Mr. Alexander Fletcher."</p></blockquote>
I see that there are other amendments in the names of my hon. Friends. I know that you would ensure that this has not been arranged, Mr. Gourlay, but does that note mean that the hon. Gentleman rather than you has selected the amendments, and that he has decided the order in which they shall be taken? If that were so, it would clearly cause great concern to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is the responsibility of the Chair to select amendments for debate. The first line which the hon. Gentleman mentioned refers to the motion immediately underneath—in other words, to the order in which the various clauses and schedules should be considered. That is a matter which will come before the Committee for approval at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, Mr. Gourlay, I thank you for your most helpful comments. I have been on many Committees, but I was slightly alarmed this morning when I picked up the Amendment Paper to see that note. If the hon. Member had selected the amendments, there might well not have been a debate at all. The Minister says that that is true, and I could well accept that. One has only to look at the way in which the Government tried to push through legislation that works against the majority of people in Scotland to understand exactly what he means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, and I am very pleased to see you in the Chair to ensure that this type of bombastic attitude, of which we are liable to see more as the Committee proceeds, is not allowed to be effective. From my experience on other Bills I am concerned that generally the world outside hears that the Bill is in Committee only very late on in the Committee stages. Once it does, I have always found that rumour immediately begins to circulate that there is something not quite right about the manner in which we are proceeding with the Bill. That is why we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
a responsibility as elected representatives to consider carefully how we should proceed with any matter in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must understand our responsibilities in these matters. If rumours begin to circulate that we have not consulted all the bodies concerned—some of my hon. Friends have mentioned some of these bodies already this morning—I am certain that rumours will circulate about the manner in which we are proceeding. I do not wish to delay the committee but I know the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council would like to have much more consultation with us before we proceed. I had the privilege of travelling down on Monday morning with my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, who told me that he had had consultations that morning with the council. He informed me, to my surprise, that it is very concerned about the haste with which we are proceeding with this Bill, haste which has denied it proper consultation with Members of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of consultation has come up several times this morning. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that we issued a consultation document on a parents' charter of parental choice in February 1980. That seems to us a reasonable time for consultations to take place with all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation procedures which have been gone through cover part of the business, but there has been no clear indication by the Government of their altitude towards schools councils, which are the other part of the parents charter. The Green Paper, the consultative document which was brought out, has had no official response. This is a sad state of affairs. I submit that this important document has not been fully consulted, or the process of consultation has not been completed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) said, the Minister's traditional complacency comes through once again in this important area of schools councils, which should have a vital role in this legislation but which they will not have because of the absence of adequate consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is peculiar that no sooner do we mention that rumours will begin to circulate than the first rumour emerges in the Committee. The Minister suggested that adequate consultation had taken place, and my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire can immediately point out a crucial area where this consultation procedure has not taken place to the extent which concerns bodies like the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. Schools councils concern me, because I used to be on a parent-teacher association, the St. John's PTA. prior to the change over to a schools council. I took part in many discussions in Dundee on the form that school councils should take. I shall have much to say when we reach that part of the Bill, but I do not want to delay the Committee by attempting to discuss schools councils now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
It is important that the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire be taken on board by the Committee. We consistently hear that hon. Members are concerned to return democracy to the people. There is no better way of doing so in education than to involve them in schools councils in a meaningful way. This cannot be done without consultation. I shall be interested when we reach the relevant part of the Bill if the Minister can assure me that, for instance, all the schools councils in Tayside have been consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised this morning at least suggest that there is something not quite right about the manner in which we are proceeding. It certainly leads me to conclude that we should decide to meet only on a Thursday morning. Those of us who are members of other Committees could then use Tuesday mornings to meet the various organisations which wish to have discussions with us. We could ensure that when we reach the point in the Bill which deals with schools councils we are all fully aware of what the people at present on schools councils are saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other points which concern me, particularly coming from Tayside, and suggest that we should not meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. A serious situation has arisen in Tayside in recent weeks, and it should be brought to the Committee's attention before we decide when the Committee should meet. Unless we can be assured that there is some support for any particular part of the Bill, I do not see how we can proceed. What has occurred in Tayside in the past few weeks certainly concerns me and I know that it concerns all of my constituents and the constituents of the hon. Members for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and for South Angus. It is of such concern that it has spread alarm and despondency throughout Tayside, particularly among those parents who are concerned about their children's education. I refer to the resignation of the Tayside regional education convener. It is very difficult to find out exactly why Miss Elizabeth Carnegy resigned, but I feel that one of the reasons was that she disagreed fundamentally with the Bill. Certainly she disagrees fundamentally with the policies of the Tayside regional education department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is straying a bit too far from the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, Mr. Gourlay, I thank you for bringing me back into order. May I ask your indulgence for another couple of sentences, because one of the people whom I would have wished to consult was the person who has been responsible for education in Tayside for the past four or five years. I cannot now do that, because that person has been removed, or has resigned. It concerns me and I know that it concerns people in Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may not be aware that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) and I attended a meeting where we discussed the rate support grant, or the implementation of the rates,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
for Tayside region. One of the things which concerned that meeting was the education budget, and one of the things which concerned the 31,000 people in Dundee was the closure of nursery schools. At that time we were given an assurance by the convener of the finance committee that those nurseries would be kept open. No sooner had we agreed not to speak on this issue than, two or three days later, we discovered that it was intended to close nursery schools, particularly in Dundee—that it was intended to close Ancrum Road nursery school and Mitchell Street nursery school. I wonder whether that was the reason behind Miss Carnegy's resignation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the areas which concern me, and these are the areas which I should like to look into before I begin to speak on the Bill, which, as many of my hon. Friends have said, is not urgent. This is a point which we want to continue stressing. There is nothing in the Bill which could become effective until 1982-83. It is important that the Opposition say clearly that we are concerned about education in Scotland. We are concerned to ensure that the Bill—which will be with us at least until 1983-84, when the Government will be thrown out of office by the people outside—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ho, ho.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to say " Ho, ho " in Scotland he would receive the reply which " Ho, ho " would bring forth from the Scottish people. The end of the verse is " Off to work we go ", and there are not many people going off to work in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should take the Bill more seriously than it has this morning. That is another reascon why we should not meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is clearly a need for all members of the Committee have much more consultation. It is a word that you, Mr. Gourlay, may tire of during the many days—perhaps even nights—of the Committee's proceedings, but it is crucial to reassure the people of Scotland that consultation is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen keep claiming that they want to involve more and more people, but we hear very little of the word " consultation ". They tend to send out their opinions and ask for comments. As the comments arrive on the Minister's desk, they gradually move towards the waste paper basket until they fall into it. One certainly could conclude that from the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is unnecessary. Certainly there is a need to improve the links between parents and education, and to meet the special educational needs of the children of Scotland, and certainly there should be more parental choice. But it could have been provided for in a much more meaningful and responsible way than in the Bill. Therefore, I support my hon. Friends who suggest that the Committee should meet only on Thursdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are much more serious problems in Scotland which a Committee like this could deal with. We could look at unemployment which will not be im-
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
proved by the Bill. That is the most important statement to make at this stage—that unemployment will not be helped by the Bill. If it were, I should be on my feet demanding that the Committee should meet night and day every day for the next two or three weeks—including Saturdays and Sundays, without overtime or double time on Sundays—to ensure that the Bill would go on the statute book as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that those sitting on your right, Mr. Gourlay, whom you cannot see, might find it difficult to come here on a Sunday. I should be prepared to come here on a Sunday if there were anything in the Bill worth coming for. But there is nothing in the Bill which demands that hon. Members should be here on Tuesday and Thursday, let alone Sunday.

I support my hon. Friends who have argued constructively that the Bill is being proceeded with far too quickly. That is in no way intended as a slur upon you as Chairman Mr. Gourlay. I realise that if there were an attempt by hon. Gentlemen to bulldoze the Bill through you would immediately assert your authority to ensure that hon Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and I were protected from their worst ravages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen may titter, but we shall see how they feel as the Committee proceeds. I hope that you will be able to afford us and Scottish education the protection that is required, Mr. Gourlay. If the Bill is to be put on the statute book, it requires serious amendment. If that serious amendment can be courteously and responsibly proceeded with by consultation, the Committee will move ahead quite smartly. But if we are to hear nothing but silence from Conservative hon. Members, all that we can assume is that they agree entirely with what is in the Bill and therefore that it is be left to the Opposition to defend Scottish education against the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does nothing for Scottish education. It does nothing to help those young people who are leaving school, some of them without any certificates. Just over 40 per cent, of children leave school without any qualification, and there is nothing in the Bill that goes any way towards reversing that statistic. It is that type of statistic that we should be concerned about, and we certainly cannot be concerned about it in this Bill. The Committee does not need to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It is a pity that it has to meet at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now getting to the stage of repetition. I must point out that the Bill has had a Second Reading in the House, and therefore it must proceed in Committee. It is too late now to argue against the Bill. The purpose of this Committee is to try to amend the Bill if need be, certainly not to turn down the Bill, which has already been approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, Mr. Gourlay, I thank you for your guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made the point that one of the problems of Scottish education was that some 40 per cent, of the children who left school

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
aged 16 left without any formal qualifications. One of the problems which this Bill will raise is the question of information. We will be asked to allow Ministers to provide regulations on the information available. The problem is that we shall not know the kind of examination which we shall have pretty well as soon as the Bill is implemented, because the Munn and Dunning proposals are in the process of being considered and worked through on a pilot basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty which will arise is that we may well be framing legislation for an examination system which at present we do not have to hand, and it will go to some way to meet the problem which my hon. Friend has correctly raised. So we have yet another example of this legislation running ahead of developments which are already in train and which will cause us undue difficulty when we come to consider it in a hasty manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but it is not entirely relevant to this debate. The Committee has been told to proceed with the Bill. What we are discussing is whether we should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to involve myself in repetition. There are many things that I should like to say on the Bill, but it is important to lay down some markers for the Committee stage. It is also important that we try to emphasise, if not to Conservative hon. Members, who are obviously not interested in listening, but to the public whom we are elected to represent that this Committee appears to be proceeding too hastily. We certainly hope that we can slow the Committee down, not in the sense that we are attempting to sabotage the Bill, but because we wish to consult all those people who wish to make points to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised the question of Munn and Dunning. I am certain that at some stage we will want to pursue Munn and Dunning much more thoroughly. It is because of this need to look at the Munn and Dunning and Warnock reports that I believe that the Committee should meet only on a Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the early stages of consideration of the British Aerospace Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Oyer) asked the Chairman for clarification of Standing Order 38, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a public bill (not being a bill to confirm a pro visional order or certificate) is ordered to be read a second time on a future day, and it appears that the standing orders relating to private business may be applicable to the bill, the Examiners of Petitions for Private Bills shall be ordered to examine the bill……"</p></blockquote>
I wonder, Mr. Gourlay, whether this Bill, although it has had its Second Reading, has been looked at to see whether or not there are any Private Bills which could affect it. I hope that at some stage the Minister will clarify this matter to ensure that there will be no effect on this Bill, so that, as it has had a Second Reading and complies with Standing Order No. 38, it is in order to proceed with it in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a hybrid Bill, and Mr. Speaker has so ruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank you for your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. I hope that you will accept that I have not attempted to delay the Committee unnecessarily. I think I have raised points which I hope the Minister will answer. I hope that, if he does not answer the points made by the Opposition, you will allow us to make further points before we take a decision on whether this Committee should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the sittings Motion for Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I hope that I shall have the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Gourlay, to answer the mysterious allegations and comments that have been made about the former convenor of education on Tayside region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will see, Mr. Gourlay, that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and I are having some much-needed consultation. I have listened with great interest to the debate. I must admit that, as always, I came to this Committee with an open mind, and I am surprised at the way in which I have allowed myself to be persuaded by my hon. Friends that we ought to seek to vote down the proposition being put to us by the Government this morning. Four of my hon. Friends have said that we shall be proceeding with this Bill at too fast a pace. It is not only my hon. Friends who say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government themselves, have shown that the proposition that the Committee should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays is not in keeping with their actions hitherto en this Bill. You will recall, Mr. Gourlay, that when the Bill was first introduced we had three or four false alarms as to when it would have its Second Reading. That was a clear indication that the Government did not consider the Bill to be urgent. I believe there were three successive weeks when we were warned that the Second Reading of the Bill would be held the following week. It never happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By that action alone, I am convinced that the Government themselves are not convinced that this measure is urgent. Once Second Reading eventually did take place, we were then faced with a position—unusual for legislation—that the Bill did not go into Committee for another three or four weeks. Normally, the practice in the House is that when a Bill has had its Second Reading it finds its way into Committee the following week. That was not the case on this Bill. Here, therefore, we have two good examples of the Government themselves suggesting that the legislation is not urgent. In the first place, it took three or four weeks to find a slot in the timetable for the Second Reading debate. In the second place, the Bill having had its Second Reading, has lain gathering dust in all the pigeonholes that gather dust until today, three or four weeks after the Second Reading, the Committee finds itself meeting to begin its consideration. Then the Minister has the temerity to come to the Committee with this motion after all these delays at the behest of the Government and with no obstacles put in the way by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
If the entire Government need to have consultations we should give them as much time as possible. It is obvious that the pressure of meeting Tuesday and Thursday would not allow the Minister to count all the £5 notes he is counting at the moment, work to have his discussions, and run the business of the Committee. Thus, it is obvious, from the kind of incidents or examples already enumerated, with the Government taking a long time to achieve a date for a Second Reading and taking a further period before bringing the Bill into Committee, that they do not consider that this legislation is urgent. The Minister has been somewhat impertinent this morning. He has been responsible for all the delays so far the Opposition having been keen to accommodate the Second Reading. At the first sitting of the Committee he suggests that we should meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. Is that fair to the committee against the background of the actions already taken by the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of the most generous Members in the House of Commons and the bulk of my argument will not be that we need consultation. I accept that we need consultation, and was not surprised this morning to see that there are 38 items to be provided by the Government for the Committee to read and study during the Committee stage so that we may all be better informed. I have counted the items ready for collection and there were only 14 of them available on the table this morning. One-third of the items promised by the Government on the list are available, and the notes to clauses are not included on the list. So two-thirds of the items listed are not available this morning. It is obvious that it would be in all our interests if the Opposition were to enable more time for the Government to provide the rest of the documents which are not yet provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also know of the Minister's difficulties. He has the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs tomorrow, where he must be cross examined on his costings in relation to his proposal to close two colleges of education. I think that today of all days his time could have been better spent being briefed about how on earth he will defend the outrageous costings he has produced on the colleges of education. I shall really feel for him tomorrow as he is put through the mill. I know why he could not spend his time being briefed this morning, it is because the second Minister who has been allocated to this Bill never says anything about anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire and I have just spent four or five weeks with the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), also a Minister in the Scottish Office, on the Forestry Bill, and we have never heard him say a word except " Aye " and " No " on that Committee. So it is obvious that the Minister with us today is in the most serious difficulty when he is looking to his right for some kind of back-up, because the second Minister allocated to this Bill is just as much Back Bench voting fodder, exercising that function from the Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The Minister has difficulties. With the generous nature that I always extend to Committees, I am anxious to accommodate the Committee so that the Committee can vote down this proposition today and give the Minister time for further thought. He can come back next Tuesday and put an alternative proposition. Or I can offer him discussions. My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, and " Mr. Whippey " the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) can get together and have discussions through the usual channels, as they say, and come up with a compromise whereby the Committee could start to meet as the document states on Tuesday 22 July 1980—that is a very good error on today's Notice Paper. Although it says "TUESDAY 22ND JULY 1980" I am sure that all that is wrong is the year and that it is meant to be 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I offer the Government some consultation. I know that other hon. Members have difficulties with the Committee. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (M. Wilson) is now under an instruction by his party that he must spend a great deal more time in Scotland. I am delighted to suggest that, as a Committee, we ought to make it possible for the hon. Member for Dundee, East to obey the commands of his party to spend more time in Scotland. One of the ways to do that is to rethink the whole approach to the way in which the Committee meets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is interrupting me in my flow, but I will give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt, but the point just made by my hon. Friend should not be missed. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said that he would defend later the reason for the resignation of the Tayside regional education convener. It is important for the people of Dundee, East to be aware that even if their Member is not here I will certainly look after the constituents of Dundee, East during this Committee stage. I should like to reassure the constituents in Dundee, East that we will make every effort to look after their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am sure that my hon. Friend's offer of help to the citizens of Dundee will not go unnoticed and that it will be taken up. I was just about to tick off hon. Members one at a time when my hon. Friend interrupted my flow. I noticed how the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), during the Committee stage of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, took an interest in every constituency in Scotland—71 constituencies, including his own. I pay him credit for that. I noticed that he had tabled a new clause that badly affected my constituents. I noticed that he was very anxious to deal with some problems that arose in Kirkcaldy, although it escapes my memeory what they were. I noticed that as that Committee evolved the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East had a universal approach to legislation. That is something which I admire and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
am anxious once again, in my generous moments, to give the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East as much time as possible to travel the 71 constituencies, from Orkney and Shetland right down to Galloway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice in the letters column in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> today a scathing letter attacking the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang). The hon. Member for Galloway will want some time to consider the reply which he has to draft in reply to that letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already drafted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Galloway says that he has already got his reply drafted. That is the first advantage I have seen of the Scottish Tory Party being able to recruit a Scottish information officer from the Scottish Office immediately the Labour Government were defeated, because I strongly suspect that it was Quintin Jardine who drafted that reply. Does the hon. Member want to claim credit for it for himself? As I say, I am sure that the hon. Member for Galloway will want some time to consider these very serious attacks on his integrity by his predecessor in the Galloway constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). The hon. Member is one of the most loyal Tories. Considering that he has been only three or four years in the Tory Party, it speaks volumes for the hon. Member. Every time he rises to speak it reminds me of a dog I used to have, who was also very obedient. We called him Fido. So every time the hon. Member for Argyll rises to support his hon. Friends I am tempted to think that you, Mr. Gourlay, might call Fido to speak. If the loyalty of the hon. Member for Argyll is not to be misplaced—because I admire loyalty,, especially in these days—the hon. Member will need a great deal of time to study the Bill in order that he is not misled in the same way as he has already been misled by Ministers. I think that he has been on every Committee since he came to the House in May 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another strong case for the Committee not to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays as the Minister suggests. The hon. Member for Argyll gives undivided, almost unquestioning, loyalty. I want him to have time to question the way in which he displays his loyalty. He can do that if the Minister takes 'the motion away and considers our suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and his world travels. I should warn the Committee that I shaU be away for a fortnight myself. I am always impressed when I switch on Radio' Forth on a Friday night and the hon. Member for Perth and Perthshire describes himself as the official Back Bench Tory spokesman on defence. That is a title which the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) would wish to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me just get this right before the hon. Gentleman interrupts me. The official Back
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Bench Tory spokesman on defence—that is how the hon. Member is introduced on Radio Forth when he returns from all these defence trips. I have got it right—I can see that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted and proud that the hon. Gentleman has got it right. That is the title that I take because it is the area of responsibility that I look after on behalf of the Back Bench Conservative group. I am also, of course, on the defence committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that the hon. Member should have been sitting where I am and seen the surprised look on his hon. Friend's face when he was saying that that was his title—the hon. Member for South Angus is still laughing. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire is very well travelled and we should not do anything to damage his prospects of indulging himself in these world travels. We should go out of our way to assist him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that I am going back to Hong Kong at my own expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caravan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Buy a single ticket.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire suggests that the hon. Gentleman should buy a single ticket, but I would not be so cruel. The hon. Gentleman should have a return ticket. I for one am always glad to see him in the House and in Committees and to hear him on Radio Forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pointed out all the personal difficulties of the hon. Gentlemen. We are all right. We can be here morning, noon and night, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays—even, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West said, on Saturdays and Sundays. We shall vote against the motion out of consideration for hon. Members opposite, because the small number of Scottish Conservative Members makes it difficult for the Tories to staff Committees. We know that some of them are badly in need of relaxation and rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished at the way in which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, who seems to drive his troops relentlessly, has. turned out since the Tories came to power. I used to think that he was a nice, gentle type in the " boy " image. I have been deceived. He is one of the hardest men I have seen in politics. The way in which he treats his Back Benchers is a disgrace. I hoped that they would have shown some backbone and rebelled against the tyranny imposed on them by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I have given just one more reason why hon. Members opposite should join us in voting against the motion. Conservative Back Benchers should come to the conclusion that enough is enough and that they will not take any more of this arm-twisting, browbeating tyranny that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West imposes on them. They should start from today. We always say that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. As my right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said at Glasgow, it is time for the lion to roar. I should have thought that some of the lions on the Conservative Back Benches would roar today and that their Whip would get the message that they will not have any more of this nonsense and that for all these reasons they would join us in voting against the Government motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Under-Secretary of State responsible for health matters very briefly. I do not want to say too much about him. Usually anything that I say about the health Minister means that I get two or three column inches in the 	<i>Sunday Mail.</i> But one of the difficulties that the Government side are in is that an Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has been added to the Committee who has absolutely no responsibility for education. I suspect that he will deal with the special-needs section of the Bill, but that is only a small part of the Bill. His colleague the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) will have to take the rest of the Bill. But there all his other work, his industrial work, his appearance before a Select Committee tomorrow and, if he persists in his intention to close Callender Park in Hamilton, he will have to go there to lock the doors himself, and that will take another day from his busy programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, Mr. Gourlay, you will have seen from my comments that, despite all that has been said by my hon. Friends, all the very good reasons why we should not meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have taken a somewhat conciliatory approach. I must admit that I lost sleep last night worrying about hon. Gentlemen opposite. I though that I would never have an opportunity to express my concern about them today. I hope that, in my conciliatory approach, this care, concern and compassion that I have for hon. Members opposite, I have persuaded them that the best thing to do today would be to vote against the proposition being made by the Minister to make him think again and come back next Tuesday with an alternative proposal. By that time the discussions will have taken place and then we can get down to the beginning of our consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavam 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first apologise to you, Mr. Gourlay, and to other members of the Committee for being absent earlier, the reason being that I was a member of the Standing Committee on the Forestry Bill. As I look around the Committee, I see that I am not alone in that difficulty. The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) was a member of the Standing Committee on the Forestry Bill. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire West (Mr. Fair-grieve), and also my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) were all members of that Standing Committee, which finished less than an hour ago. It is my experience that there are too many Committees in this House which overlap. There is no need at all for this Committee to begin this morning. We should not even have been meeting this morning, since four members of this Committee had to serve on another
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Committee in this place. How on earth can we do justice to both pieces of legislation? No wonder that people outside say that when legislation eventually reaches the statute book, especially legislation by this Tory Government, it is so imperfect and so against their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand too that some members of the Committee have only recently finished service on the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. It seems to me that, as soon as one Scottish Bill is finished, the Government seem to be desperate to introduce another one. They have considerable difficulties in manning these Committees because there are so few Tories from Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you may know, Mr. Gourlay, my colleagues have asked me to act as Opposition Whip during the passage of this Bill in Committee. I know that my colleagues are men of valour and strength, and there is no fear that they will lack the determination or tenacity which will be necessary to oppose this Bill with absolute resolution. I wonder whether the Government members of the Committee will now be in the state of being grossly overworked, if this Committee is to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In particular, I am thinking about the Front Bench team. This is probably the worst Front Bench team we have ever had in the whole history of Scottish education. Nevertheless, the Opposition are generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a teacher I always said that when one is dealing with children of limited ability it is advisable to take one's time. I say to Ministers with limited ability, instead of overdoing it, and doing this crash course, as it were, every Tuesday and Thursday when inevitably they will make mistakes, they would do far better to meet on either the Tuesday or the Thursday, but certainly not both. It has now reached the stage where the Scottish Office is so inefficient that many of my constituents are complaining about the time it takes to receive a reply from a Minister. I know the Civil Service writes these letters, but they have to go through the formality of getting the ministerial autograph at the bottom, just to prove that some Tories can actually write their own names. The pile-up of correspondence at the Scottish Office is ridiculous, particularly at the Scottish Education Department. I think that if the Ministers are to be here every Tuesday morning and every Thursday morning, it will cause added difficulties and an even bigger hold-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
