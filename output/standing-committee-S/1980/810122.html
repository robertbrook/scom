	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) to speak to bis amendment to clause 3, I wish to make the following statement. Because of an error in favour of the Ayes when counting last Tuesday's Division, the two figures to be correctly recorded are Ayes 7 and Noes 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am intrigued by your statement. It would assist the Committee if we knew how we had voted. The number of Committee members who in fact voted does not add up to the total recorded in column 118 of the 	<i>Official Report.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also one intriguing entry in the Division list. Having no doubt listened to the arguments from St. Lucia, or wherever he is, imy constituent, the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), appears to have voted with the Noes. Did he have a proxy vote, or a postal vote, or was it a magnificent achievement by the new Government Whip? If the hon Member had such proxy voting facilities, will that also apply to my hon Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean), who, I understand, is accompanying the hon Member for Edinburgh, West on his visit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's point is well taken by the Chair. The record will be amended accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>VALUATION OF NON-INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS OTHER THAN DWELLING-HOUSES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [20 January],</i> No. 16, in line 39, leave out "in".</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are taking amendment No. 17, in line 42, leave out from first "buildings)" to "shall" in line 43.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are probing, because the Opposition feel that the technicality and complexity of this area should be exposed to a wider public. We think that the wording could be clearer. We should also like to know why dwelling houses are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister may already be aware that the present policy of Edinburgh district council
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
seems to be that it is not prepared to carry out repairs to property. Does that mean that its tenants will now be under some sort of repairing lease? What will happen about their rateable values?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would like to know the Minister's detailed thinking on that matter in general. The question came up as a side issue. The Minister will know from his own surgeries in Westerhailes that there is a great deal of concern in Edinburgh at present about the repairs policy of Edinburgh district council. Will clause 3 be able to accommodate what may be a new situation with regard to the leasing of Edinburgh district council properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing out that the amendment is purely probing in order to enable discussion on clause 3. The purpose of the clause is to provide for the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Valuation of non-industrial buildings other than dwelling-houses"</p></blockquote>
direct to net annual value, rather than the present requirement of valuing them first at gross annual value and—after certain statutory deductions— establishing the net annual value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has been considered for some time. Indeed, the Layfield report on local government finance recommended that this system for non-industrial property other than dwelling houses had become outdated and burdensome, because with such commercial property it had become the practice to include leasing arrangements in the leasing out of such property. Therefore, there was an adequate basis, when considering the rental value of such properties, for including the landlord's responsibilities and the rental value actually determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became not only inefficient but absurd to fix an arbitrary gross annual value and subtract from it certain statutory deductions—which may bear no relation to the costs involved—instead of going straight to a net annual value for rating purposes. This clause provides a simplification. It does not extend to dwelling houses because for those such an arrangement is not normally made—although there are exceptions. It is therefore more straightforward for the assessor to go to gross annual value and then to make the statutory deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked whether the recent decision by Edinburgh district council requiring tenants to pay for certain repairs had any significance. Although this policy is new to Edinburgh, it is not new to Scotland. East Lothian district council, for example, has pursued such a policy for some years. Neither is it relevant to the point under consideration, because, as I understand it from correspondence with Edinburgh district council, as a constituency Member, it would continue to accept all the responsibilities which a landlord would be obliged to accept. But it is not prepared to continue with discretionary services which it has provided over the years for various minor repairs to properties of its tenants which would not be the landlord's responsibility in the private sector and which it has no legal responsibility to maintain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some dispute about where the borderline should be drawn, and individual tenants
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
may be pursuing these matters in the courts or in other ways. The counts may have to clarify the situation, hut the point still has no effect here, because any legal responsibility of a local authority is landlord would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that general explanation of the purpose of the clause will enable the hon Gentleman to seek to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes quite a significant change. I am sorry that no copies of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956 seem to available. The table in the corner of the room, where we have all the documents, looks like a Labour Party jumble sale. But the notes on the Act are adequate: They refer to the first schedule and give deductions from the gross annual value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, fairly and properly, read out the notes and the brief which we have all read, but he has not explained why this change is being made. We are dealing with commercial lettings where the occupier is on a "repairing lease basis"—the phrase used in the notes on clauses. How does the assessor obtain the information about the actual cost of maintenance repairs? Will it still be on a formula, or are we replacing the first schedule of the 1956 Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of general interest, because presumably the basic figure on which the assessor has based his valuation has been the rental. Now that we are moving on to this new system, which presumably takes into account the cost of repairs and maintenance, or whatever is allowed in the first schedule, what are the mechanics for making the adjustment to go on to the net rateable value as distinct from the gross annual value less the deduction shown in the schedule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the assessor's point of view, the situation becomes far simpler. In the past he has had to look at the rental and then gross it up to the gross annual value and make certain statutory deductions to bring it to the proper net annual value. In future, he will be able to assume, for commercial property, that the evidence of the rents being charged includes the cost of the tenant's responsibility for repairs. In other words, the rent figure absorbs the cost of the repairs. Therefore, he need go no further. That figure can then be used directly to determine the net annual value. He can forged about the concept of gross annual value in the case of these properties. He simply looks at the rental being charged and uses that as the basis for determining the net annual value. With a full repairing lease, the landlord will have included the cost of repairs when he determined the rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
Committee, but we are now dealing with the mechanics as distinct from major principles. Do these provisions merely tidy up as a result of the Layfield committee? The committee reported in 1976, and I do not remember hearing any great pressure to make these changes. I am not objecting to them, as they are obvious changes, which we accept. But did the advisory committee suggest them, or the assessors, or have they been lurking around the Scottish Office since 1976 until someone found an appropriate piece of legislation to enable this tidying-up to be done legitimately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to speculate about who or what was lurking about the Scottish Office after 1976—at least up till 1979. The hon Gentleman is in a far better position to comment on that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Layfield committee reported in 1976 the hon Gentleman's own Government's Green Paper on local government finance in Scotland, published in 1977, said that this recommendation would be the subject of consultation after the revaluation in 1978. Both the Convention and the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council have recommended that this change be made. It is on that basis that we have incorporated the recommendation in the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO AMEND TABLE OF DEDUCTIONS FROM GROSS ANNUAL VALUE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 4, line 6, after "heritages", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by varying either the deduction specified in the second column of the said table or the level of gross annual value to which these deductions apply or both".</p></blockquote>
The two amendments to clause 4 are fairly straightforward. Again we are seeking clarification, and I hope that the Minister will be able to expand on the notes which he kindly made available to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the hon Gentleman is proposing to discuss the two amendments to clause 4 together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Gourlay. I am introducing them together, and then I shall deal with them separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may move only one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an omnibus resolution in two parts, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 seeks clarification. Will the Minister explain why he is seeking powers here which are not in the English Act? I appreciate that there is no great need for us to be on all fours with what is going on in England, but as one justification for the legislation we are often told that what is taking place in England is desirable and therefore should be paralleled in Scotland. In this instance, no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
power to amend the table of statutory deductions exists in England, and we wonder why he is taking these powers for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has asked me to explain the thinking behind clause 4, and I am happy to do so. The table of deductions in schedule I to the 1956 Act is used to obtain net annual value from gross annual value. The first column comprises a series of bands of gross annual value. The method of calculating the deduction for each band is shown in the second column. It will still be necessary to make the appropriate calculation of gross annual value for dwelling houses and reduce it to net annual value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not amend the table itself; it merely extends the Secretary of State's ability to amend the table by order. At present he may amend only the second column, namely, the column dealing with the method of calculating the deductions. He cannot amend the first column, which indicates the bands of gross annual value so affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The table has not been amended since 1956, and the figures are now considerably out of date. They vary from under £15 to more than £100, and those figures clearly justify revision. Of course, it is necessary to revise them only in the light of the next revaluation. It is not necessary to propose appropriate figures in the Bill itself, but it would be the Secretary of State's intention to use such a facility to introduce new figures in time for the next revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. As drafted, the clause enables the Secretary of State to amend the table of deductions. The amendment seeks to insert a more detailed description of how the table may be amended. It is not necessary for the clause to be so specific, because the options that the amendment implies are included in the clause in its present form. For that reason, I assure the hon Gentleman that he would be quite safe in seeking to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that assurance from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 4, line 12, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) the words from 'instrument' to the end of the said subsection (7) shall be omitted and there shall be substituted the words 'subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.'.".</p></blockquote>
I think that it was on Tuesday that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke of the need for negative resolutions. Amendment No. 19 seeks to introduce consistency in the treatment of amendments. We feel that it would be desirable, in this instance, to have such a resolution, and we should like the Minister to include it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there does not need to be a great parliamentary scrutiny to change
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
the figures in the column, but, to deal with the current figures—I must confess my ignorance again—I do not know whether that produces a distortion. I presume that there are not many properties on the market whose rateable value is less than £100. If there are, they must be very poor-quality tenement properties in parts of Glasgow or perhaps in country areas such as Argyllshire, where there are many sub-tolerable houses. I have spent some time trying to exhort people to get a move on over that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything that relates to 1956 money values is totally out of date. Inflation has taken us a long way away from those figures. Therefore, the clause makes sense. But the Minister has not said whether it creates a distortion or whether it means that everyone is now in the top bracket. Presumably, if he makes a change or includes new figures, it must be because of a distortion. In other words, will there be changes in the formula as well as in the figures and the bands shown on the schedule?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not go to the stake about the need for parliamentary scrutiny on this point, but I would like to be assured that there is some dialogue either with the advisory committee or with the interested parties who may be affected by these figures. As I understand it, we have now removed all commercial properties from this formula of gross annual value. We are now dealing with industrial and domestic premises, and the other categories, in which the properties included never seem clear, even to those who are in them. Has a distortion been created, or is it likely that the figures will be updated soon or, as the Minister said, at the next revaluation, whenever that might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the question raised by the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). It is too late for the existing figures to affect all the properties that have been entered into the valuation roll, because their rateable value has already been established. New properties coming on to the roll are treated on all fours with properties which are already there. Overall, the deductions might be less than those to which new properties might otherwise be entitled, because the figures are outdated. However, it would be improper to change the figures before a revaluation, because that would give an unfair benefit to new properties coming on to the market over those that had already been entered into the valuation roll over the years. Therefore, the appropriate way to handle the matter is to ensure that the figures are updated in time for the next revaluation of domestic dwellings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disagreeing with the Minister, but I was asking whether there was a distortion. Of course new properties are being treated on all fours with the rest. I am asking what the difference was in 1957 between the treatment of a property with a gross annual value of under £100 and a property with a greater gross annual value, as the formula is different. I have not worked out the mathematics, but presumably there is a difference, albeit marginal. Virtually every property is now valued at over £100.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
Therefore, as the Minister said, there is fairness. They are all being treated alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing for discrimination, but if the Minister proposes in future to bring back the system of bands, presumably it has to be set at a level. I am not trying to make a party point about the rate of inflation. However, if there is to be sense in the system, the figures have to be mathematically correct and flexible in that the money values are reflected in the gross annual values and the formula, whatever the bands might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my questions are totally irrelevant in the sense that they do not apply now, because no change is being made. All that we are discussing at the moment is the power that the Secretary of State is taking in clause 4, subject to the amendment, and the form of parliamentary scrutiny for the future. I presume that the intention is to keep the system of bands, but to update it in a more relevant way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. Perhaps I may clarify the matter in this way. The schedule at present has five separate bands of gross annual value, namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not exceeding £15.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Exceeding £15 but not exceeding £20.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Exceeding £20 but not exceeding £40.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Exceeding £40 but not exceeding £100.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Exceeding £100."</p></blockquote>
I shall not list all the deductions, but merely show the contrast. If the gross annual value is "Not exceeding £15", the deduction is
	<br><blockquote><p>"40 per cent, of the gross annual value."</p></blockquote>
If, on the other hand, the gross annual value is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exceeding £100",</p></blockquote>
which is at the other end of the list—I hope that the hon Gentleman understands what I am about to say, as I am not sure that I do—the deduction is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"£20 together with 16$ per cent, of the amount by which the gross annual value exceeds £100."</p></blockquote>
The hon Gentleman may like to study that when it appears in the 	<i>Official Report</i> and comment upon it later. I shall understand if he chooses to respond in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it means that the smaller the gross annual value, the higher the proportion of deduction for repairs. However, even with properties exceeding £100—these figures were fixed in 1956—the amount deducted is modest compared with today's prices. Therefore, it would be in the interest of all concerned to update these figures whenever the next revaluation takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to pursue the matter, but I find it disturbing. We are dealing with a fundamental basis for rating. I am not arguing about whether they are to be abolished, but it seems odd that there have been no representations, to my knowledge, from anybody in the business community, or from ratepayers organisations representing the occupiers. With respect to the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) Conservative Members are always shouting—literally,
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
I must say, after last night—about those groups. I am surprised that there have not been representations on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has explained how the schedule works. I think that this formula needs scrutiny. Let us take as an example a gross annual value exceeding £100. I am not good at mathematics and I do not have the time to work out what it means. We had a long discussion last night about repairs to, and maintenance of, local authority housing. Is that deduction from the gross annual value updated while bearing in mind the cost of repairs and maintenance? Does the schedule include only industrial and domestic property? I genuinely do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the deduction from gross annual must have some relevance. The schedule states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"£20 together with 161 per cent, of the amount by which the gross annual value exceeds £100."</p></blockquote>
Are we keeping a formula such as that? What is the evidence for not making it 15 per cent, of everything over £100? We must be informed about the current practice that makes this out of date. Does anybody know whether we are likely to change this? What representations have there been? How does the formula work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I was relating my remarks to amendment No. 19, which is about the form of parliamentary scrutiny that would be applied in the event of the schedule's being changed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with both amendment No. 19 and the specific point made by the hon Gentleman. As he will appreciate, .the provision enables the figures to be changed only by order rather than requiring primary legislation. As far as we are aware, there is no disagreement from any outside body. An order is highly desirable to bring up to date the appropriate figures. We intend to consult closely COSLA, the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council and any other outside interest which may wish to comment when an order to change the figures is being contemplated. That will be 'the time when such bodies will wish to say what will be an appropriate level.

In his amendment, the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has put forward the proposal that it would be more sensible and appropriate to use the negative procedure when dealing with such an order. On consideration, I am inclinde to agree with the hon Gentleman. It is a sensible proposal, which is welcome.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's statement, we shall be happy to seek to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reiterate the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). We are a little concerned that many of the wide-ranging changes being suggested come largely from the Scottish Office and do not seem either to have popular support or to be the result of consultations elsewhere. Other organisations which are vocal on other matters have tended not to pay too much attention to this part of the Bill which suggests that they are perhaps less interested in these rather technical matters—with which I have succeeded in confusing most of us with for a fair bit of the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the fact that they are somewhat technical does not necessarily mean that other bodies such as COSLA or ratepayers' associations ought not to have been consulted beforehand. When we come to other clauses in this part of the Bill, I hope that that will be taken on board. I know that local authority valuation people—the assessors—have been looking at this point, and my own local authorities have been involved. However, with regard to some of these points, it is unfortunate that the Minister can call in aid so few other organisations which have been prepared to back him in the legislation. But in the knowledge that the Minister will bring something forward later which will achieve the same end, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RELAXATION OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO NOTIFICATION FOR RATE RELIEF FOR CHARITABLE ORGANISATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 4, line 19, after "effect," insert "(ia) after paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> there shall be inserted the following paragraph—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) are occupied by any organisation which falls within a category which the Secretary of State may designate for the purposes of this section as being philanthropic or religious or concerned with education, social welfare, recreation, science, literature or the arts.";'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Secretary of State to bring certain voluntary organisations' premises into the scope of the statutory rates remission of 50 per cent., which at present is available only under rather restricted circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
What I hope to do is to insert a new category in section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions etc.) (Scotland) Act 1962, which at present provides a 50 per cent, rates remission for only two categories of organisations and their property. The first category is premises
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupied by, or by trustees for, a charity and are wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes (whether of that charity or of that and other charities)".</p></blockquote>
The second category at present is properties
	<br><blockquote><p>"held on trust for use as an almshouse".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether there are many of those around still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would insert a third category, which would enable the Secretary of State to draw into the terms of this statutory rates remission certain other borderline cases. I am sure that from time to time practically every hon Member will have come across borderline cases in his constituency of charitable and voluntary organisations which should have as strong a claim to comparable status for statutory rates remission as those which qualify at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the Secretary of State to bring some of these borderline cases within the scope of statutory remission. The Inland Revenue, which at present is charged with determining whether voluntary organisations fall within the terms of the present legislation, is perhaps not the best-qualified body to determine the social value or merit of any voluntary organisation. As I say, there are many borderline cases and anomalies under the present system. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment, even if he cannot accept it as drafted, to make it possible for him to bring other worthy organisations within the scope of statutory remission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the last sitting I said that I was not anxious to give the Secretary of State any further sweeping powers or discretions. The distinction between that and now, when I am trying to give him additional power and discretion, is that the other powers which he is seeking are essentially destructive and, some might argue, malevolent, while this power would be purely benign. Surely that would be helpful to all concerned, particularly those involved in voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise this point as a result of a good deal of correspondence that I have had with organisations in my constituency, in particular, football and rugby clubs, which over the years have found themselves in severe difficulties in paying their rates. I cite in particular correspondence that I had with Dunbar United football club in 1979. It found that, while its gate receipts were £337.86, in that same year it was was paying £445.30 in rates. I hate to think what the comparable figures would be now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The club could not come within the scope of the existing legislation, so it could not get the statutory rates remission, while other comparable football clubs in East Lothian and in the region were getting a 100 per cent, rates remission because their football grounds were on ground classified as public parks. I feel that this a clear anomaly. It is wrong that organisations such as the football club to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
I referred should find themselves excluded from eligibility to statutory rates remission on the basis of technicalities imposed by the Inland Revenue in its position as the judge of What is a charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I missed the name of the team that my hon Friend referred to. If it is a junior team—it may well be, as they make a good contribution in his part of the country—a practical problem arises. Some of the junior clubs' grounds, and perhaps some of the senior grounds for all I know, are owned by the local district council or, in some cases, the regional council. Therefore, they are not getting remission of rates, but they are hardly paying a rent or they are paying no rent. It is a slightly different matter. That is the point that I was trying to clarify. Who are the club and what does it own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend. The club—I am astonished that he has not heard of it—is Dunbar United football club. It is one of a number of junior, well-supported, but none the less small teams which function within my constituency. It owns its own ground and it is burdened with rates, while many comparable clubs are getting either the 50 per cent, remission under the existing legislation or a 100 per cent, remission if they are taking advantage of land on public parks, which exempts them from paying any rates. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend will understand that these are extremely anomalous situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only sports clubs are involved. Umpteen other voluntary organisations suffer from similar problems as a result of the arbitrary effect of the present law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman explain a little more to the Committee how he has reached these various categories within his amendment? For instance, would he regard—I presume he would—the Conservative Party in Scotland as a philanthropic organisation? Would he perhaps, with his known landed interests, regard shooting syndicates and angling clubs as recreational? Perhaps, finally, he could tell us whether in a sense he is trying to introduce a quasi-eleemosynary provision into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal with one intervention at a time. I am sorry that Government Back Benchers are choosing to filibuster on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to all those spurious points which the hon Gentleman raised is "No". This list of adjectives and categories is to be found further on in the Local Government (Financial Provisions etc.) (Scotland) Act 1962, where bodies covered by these descriptions can qualify for discretionary rates remission from local authorities. I am simply trying to make it possible for the Secretary of State to
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
draw these categories into line with other broadly comparable voluntary organisations which at present qualify for statutory rates remission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has raised a most interesting point. Indeed, my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) emphasised the question of the quasi-eleemosynary provision. I do not want to encourage the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) to embark on supererogation in putting forward his argument, but could he, for example, tell us how he would classify masonic lodges, either with or without bar facilities? Would they come within his categories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to indulge in supererogation—mainly because I have not a clue what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is not that I or any other individual member of the Committee should be able to classify masonic lodges or anything else, but that it should be possible for the Secretary of State, no doubt in consultation with the Scottish Council of Social Services and other organisations, to bring in borderline cases. I am not asking for any dramatic new departures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon Friend not to fall for an hon Member on the Government Benches who is trying to .trick him and make some embarrassing or indiscreet remarks about a masonic lodge. As far as I am aware, any religious establishment qualifies for remission of rates. A masonic lodge is a religious establishment—or so such lodges say; I am not a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question clearly is to the Minister. What categories and, within the categories, what institutions already qualify for remission of rates? He might be quite surprised at some of the bodies that qualify now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister will be able to help us on some of these specific issues. I am extremely interested in the point being raised about masonic lodges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon Gentleman in a second. Unfortunately I have never received an invitation to become a member of a masonic lodge. This may have something to do with the fact that I am a Roman Catholic. If there are any members of masonic lodges on the Committee, I shall be happy to give way to them and let them clarify whether masonic lodges are religious organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon Gentleman is doing a useful service, because many organisations are concerned to know how they fit into any particular category. Although the debate has raised some lightheartedness, it has a serious undertone. The Scottish Gliding Union and the Tayside flying club—two of my own interests—would also be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
interested in any 'benefits going to football clubs or anyone else. Naturally this matter is serious, because if it appears that some are enjoying something that others are not, that is worth hearing about in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Gentleman. The amendment is serious and is designed to improve benefits which may be allowed to genuine voluntary organisations. I am glad that the hon Gentleman appreciates that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consulted the Scottish Council of Social Service before I tabled the amendment. The council made it clear that it wants a 100 per cent, rates remission for all voluntary organisations. Clearly, it is not possible to table an amendment to provide 100 per cent, rates remissions because that would not come within the scope of the preamble to the Bill. Mr. Ross Walker, the director of the Scottish Council of Social Service, said that he fully supported the spirit of my amendment. I am glad to see that Conservative Members also think that it could serve a useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make it possible for the Secretary of State to extend rates remission to amateur sports clubs, charity shops, such as Oxfam, and to any of a number of other categories of genuine voluntary organisations and 'Charities which are not now covered by the strict Inland Revenue definition of charities. In some instances those definitions are quite restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment as it would benefit many eminently deserving voluntary organisations which at present have to take pot luck on discretionary rates relief. There are wild variations from one local authority to another on the amount of discretionary rates remission given t different types of charities or voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add one rider. If the Minister accepts the amendment, or the spirit of it, I hope that he will see fit to compensate local authorities for any loss of rating revenue that may arise from the implementation of extended rates remission which he, or his successors, may grant if the Bill is so amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I do not wish to niggle, but I see that my hon Friend has a copy of the relevant extract from the 1962 Act. I am not surprised about that, because my hon Friend usually does his homework. However, I cannot find a copy in all that mess on the table in the corner. I realise that amendment No. 38 is a late amendment, but I cannot see the 1962 Act to which the amendment refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful now to have a copy handed to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by recognising the worthwhile objectives of the hon Gentleman in moving the amendment. I appreciate that he feels that those objectives would be of considerable benefit to worthy voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would help if I pointed out the present law before I respond to the hon Gentleman's amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
ment. As section 4(2) of the 1962 Act now operates, 50 per cent, of relief must be granted on property which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupied by, or by trustees for, a charity and are wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes".</p></blockquote>
The practice of the Inland Revenue in regard to charities may require improvement. Nevertheless, the law clearly states that if it is a charity there is a mandatory requirement to provide at least 50 per cent, rates relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 4(5) of the same Act provides that if the property is occupied by a non-profit-making organisation
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose main objects are charitable or are otherwise philanthropic or religious or concerned with education, social welfare, science, literature or the fine arts".</p></blockquote>
the rating authority may grant a deduction from rating liability and discretionary relief of this kind may be granted in addition to any mandatory relief to which a body is entitled under the earlier provision. At present, there is no statutory limit about the level of relief that might be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by the hon Gentleman is whether it is reasonable to draw a distinction between bodies which are clearly charitable and which already have mandatory relief, and those which are not and should not be considered charitable—however worthy they may be. If they are considered charitable, the hon Gentleman should properly direct his representations to the Charity Commission in England, or, in Scotland follow the methods used by the Inland Revenue in determining whether a body is charitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to change what is a completely separate area of the law because hon Members feel that the present definition of "charity" is not wide enough. If the hon Gentleman's amendment were accepted, vast numbers of organisations could be included which by no stretch of the imagination could be considered charitable—as well as one or two genuine charities. Tennis clubs, flying clubs, masonic lodges, may all be desirable bodies, but it would be incorrect to suggest that they are charities or even remotely like charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State could define only general categories. He would not be able to identify individual properties and say, for example, "I am going to categorise the Dundee flying club or the Dunbar masonic lodge." He would be dealing with general categories without knowing whether the individual property for which mandatory relief would then be claimed would be felt by most people in normal circumstances to be justified in escaping the rates net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the local authority in whose area a property is situated has complete discretion as to whether rating relief is appropriate. It knows the circumstances and whether the organisation should be helped in the way that the hon Gentleman—and all hon Members—might feel appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, if there were evidence of confusion, misunderstanding or unfair decisions by local authorities, there might be an argument for looking again at the general provisions, although perhaps not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
for the hon Gentleman's mandatory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not aware of any such representations and have not received any ourselves. The hon Gentleman may be aware of one or two isolated cases, but I have no evidence of any dramativ unfairness by local authorities in the exercise of their discretion. I do not blame Mr. Flockhart of the Scottish Council for Social Service for welcoming the hon Gentleman's amendment. Naturally any organisations offered the prospect of mandatory rate relief would welcome it, and one could not blame them. But any rating revenue foregone by a local authority because of such relief has to be paid by someone else and, whether by central Government through the taxpayer or local authorities through other ratepayers, the money will have to be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, if an organisation is not charitable, there is an argument for allowing the local authority to grant up to 100 per cent, relief if circumstances appear to justify it. But I could not recommend that just because an organisation came within a particular category—yet had nothing to do with a charitable purpose—it should automatically receive the mandatory relief which would be the result of the hon Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that the Inland Revenue is the most appropriate body to define what is a charity? I referred earlier to Oxfam charity shops. Should such bodies sometimes pay more in rates than they make in profit? Should not the Secretary of State bring premises of this kind within the scope of statutory remission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not necessarily saying that the Inland Revenue is the best body to determine such matters. We have no Charity Commission in Scotland and it has been the Inland Revenue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman would do it better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon Gentleman's expression of faith, but I am not sure that the Secretary of State would do it better, because he could deal only with national categories. The Oxfam shop of which the hon Gentleman was talking is a good example. There are large numbers of shops, some of which, like Oxfam, are entirely charitable in their objectives, but others may have temporary jumble sales in aid of a political party. My own party and no doubt the hon Gentleman's often rent a shop for a day or a week to sell clothes to raise money for a voluntary organisation. Political parties do it, but one could not argue that their's was a charitable purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State were required, for example, to designate a shop which was being used temporarily by a non-profit making organisation to raise money for charity, it would be difficult to frame that in a way that included the Oxfam shop but excluded the political party. At the moment we have a clear situation in which a local authority, knowing
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
the circumstances in its area, is able to come to a judgment on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a good argument for changing the system for designating charities. I do not dispute that. In the past I have expressed views about how charitable status can be given or removed, not just in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom. There may well be such arguments, but one does not deal with that problem simply by dealing with rate relief. The Inland Revenue is involved because charities are entitled to tax exemption. There may be a powerful case for changing the law on charities—many have argued to that effect for years—but that does not help us in this matter because the amendment is not restricted to the proposer's view of charities. He has quite deliberately extended it to cover many organisations which he accepts are not charities but which the Secretary of State would be able to designate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that such a provision would be far too wide. It would remove potentially large sums of revenue from the local authority, and they would have to be raised elsewhere. It is unrealistic of the hon Gentleman to expect the Secretary of State to make equivalent sums available—if it is large sums that we are talking about. In any event, at the end of the day it is the public who pay, either as taxpayers or ratepayers. The question is whether organisations which could—not necessarily would— be included at the whim of the Secretary of State, whether they be masonic lodges, flying clubs or tennis clubs, deserve that priority over the ordinary ratepayer who may resent such exemption when there is no obvious reason for it being necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dissent from the hon Gentleman. It is highly desirable for a local authority to use not only common sense but sensitive understanding in its approach to non-profit making organisations within its rating area. There may be an odd case which is thought to be unfair, but I do not think that there have been many. I have made representations on behalf of non-profit making organisations in my constituency and as a consequence an acceptable agreement between the local authority and the organisation has been reached. That does not always happen, but for the most part there is no evidence of any widespread abuse. On that basis I hope that the hon Gentleman will not feel obliged to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that the Minister is dismissing the matter rather too glibly and easily and is not taking account of the spirit of what my hon Friend has said. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to what has been said—whether or not he accepts the amendment—and, if necessary, himself make a proposition that improves matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my own experience that there is genuine concern. I worked for charitable organisations for a long time and I know a little about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
mechanisms which operate in the designation of charities. I am surprised that we have not had representations on this subject from the various voluntary bodies. I suspect that it is because the provisions that are being suggested are not widely known because little publicity has been given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our consideration of the Bill might have been helped in this instance—and in others—if the Committee had been set up as one of the new special Standing Committees. We could then have heard evidence from the charitable and voluntary organisations and from assessors on the previous subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend had consultations on this matter with voluntary organisations, who are clearly interested and should have been more widely appraised. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government had any consultations with them on the subject? It is a matter of major concern to charities and voluntary organisations. It would have been helpful if a systematic approach had been made to seek their views and suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There may toe a better way of achieving what he wants to achieve which does not fall into the trap described by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamtilon) of allowing rates relief for these private schools, which are already far too well subsidised by the taxpayer and the ratepayer.

11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue currently deals with applications for charitable status in Scotland. I was pleased to hear that the Minister and his colleagues may look at the procedure to see whether it is appropriate and (relevant, as in Scotland it is cumbersome and awkward compared with the procedure south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cast no aspersions on the staff of the Inland Revenue office in Edinburgh who deal with this matter. I have had the opportunity of visiting the office and talking with staff. They are a sympathetic group of people. Those with specific responsibility for this matter—perhaps it is one person—take their responsibility seriously, look at the applications and go into the matter in great detail. I was impressed by that. But when they are doing that job, they are not thinking specifically of rates relief. They are thinking of a much wider concept, of all aspects of charitable status. They are deciding in the light of the application to give charitable status right across the board, which involves many other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specifically, as it is the Inland Revenue which deals with it, charitable status involves taxation
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
and being able to claim back the income tax on donations. That is why the income tax department deals with the matter. Taxation is its primary concern and it is what the Inland Revenue bears in mind when looking at applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there ought to be another mechanism for dealing with rates relief. The Minister contends that local authorities have the power and the discretion at the moment. He is right. They look at the possibility of giving rates relief to .these categories of organisations, as my hon Friend pointed out. However, one of the problems is that organisations which are exactly the same in every region of Scotland may get rates relief in one region but not in another. Yet they may be branches of the same national organisation. This situation is creating tremendous anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend suggested—there may be a better mechanism for it—that the Secretary of State may be able to designate organisations which do not come within the current narrow limit for charities. He may be able to designate organisations throughout Scotland which are clearly doing a good job in the community and which have the same kind of set-up in Tayside as in Lothian, or in Grampian as in Strathclyde—I am not, on this occasion, picking out any authorities for a particular purpose—but which get rate relief in one authority tout not in another. This has already created tremendous problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that he had had no representations on this subject. This is because the organisations are not going to him at present. However, there is concern about the matter. I give an example of an anomaly in the Inland Revenue's definition of charities and allocation of charitable status within Scotland. A club run by an old people's welfare committee affiliated to Age Concern is a charitable organisation, has charitable status and gets rates relief. But a club run by an old age pensioner's association affiliated to the Scottish Old Age Pensioners Association and doing exactly the same thing is not charitable, because it is contended by the Inland Revenue that the Scottish Old Age Pensioners Association as a whole, at a national level, carries out political activities—lobbying and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the arguments about why one club has charitable status and another has not. But that anomaly has arisen, where the same thing is being done by two different organisations but where one gets charitable status and therefore rates relief and the other does not. The Minister can no longer say that he has had no representations, because I have drawn that case to his attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That example also raises the question of charitable status because organisations which have that status now are involved more and more in making representations to Government, and rightly so. They are involved in the grass roots of working in the country, helping people in distress, helping with difficult categories of people, with young people or whatever. They want to make representations to the Government and there is nothing wrong with that. But the problem now is that they are worried that if they continue to make representations to Members of Parliament, to Government or to Civil Servants,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
the Inland Revenue will start looking at them and with say "Maybe this organisation is no longer of charitable status." That is causing tremendous prablems for some organisations with local branches which have clubs, or whatever, because they are then having to think "We must consider the wisdom of making these representations. We must think again, or our local branches will lose the rates relief." That is a problem, which goes a little beyond what my hon Friend is suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what I said at the beginning. My hon Friend may not have found the best mechanism for carrying out the idea, but he has found a very important point. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is important, give him an assurance today that he will look at the matter further in the light of what has been said and come back to us with some suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has raised a reasonable point for debate and that he may have identified individual problems. I am certainly willing to discuss the matter with the convention and other interested bodies to see whether they feel that the existing provisions lead to major anomalies of the kind suggested by the hon Gentleman. I can give no undertaking for any legislative proposal, because at this stage we have no hard evidence to suggest that the law needs changing. However, we shall consider the convention's views to see whether it wishes to identify any requirement for legislative reform and we shall consider the matter in the light of its comments. I hope that the hon Gentleman will appreciate that it would not be possible for me to go beyond that at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very good debate today. We should be very grateful ito my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for raising this question. We are happy to hear the Minister's response. Indeed, it would be out of character for this Government to deal with voluntary organisations in any other way. We would like to believe that they place great store on self-help and that the Samuel Smiles philosophy is what passes for the philosophical 'basis of the Prime Minister's view on politics. To give assistance to voluntary organisations in this way would be in keeping with her general thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, like my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), I have certain misgivings about the category concerned with education. In my constituency, Dollar Academy is already in receipt of 50 per cent, rates relief. I feel that in that circumstance Central Region is being robbed of money which it could usefully spend on schools or on helping voluntary organisations elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some anomalies. I understand that the Minister will not necessarily look at private schools or so-called educational voluntary organisations in this category. However, I appreciate that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
had to take all the categories and was probably right to do so. But the Opposition would be a little careless if we did not raise the question of educational organisations. If local authorities cannot get more money through the rate support grant, it seems legitimate that they should seek opportunities elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also significant that in the debate we have reached accord with the Government, because for the first time in this Committee we have had three interventions from their Back Benches. That is evidence of their concern and I am glad to see that the Minister has to some extent met this recondite group of petitioners. They appear to represent hunting, shooting fishing, flying, gliding, and freemasonry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I should just add an additional category—museums. I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not surprising that the Conservative Party is concerned about museums, as many of its opinions would best he reposing therein. But I am sure that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian would listen sympathetically to the question of museums, as he has the Myreton motor museum in his constituency.

I am not very well acquainted with my hon Friend's domestic arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that my hon Friend was not suggesting that my home is the Myreton motor museum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I was merely suggesting that it comes within my hon Friend's constituency and might well benefit from some form of assistance, as would the aircraft museum near Haddington, also in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an endless range of opportunities here. I was surprised to hear of the problem of Dunbar football cluh. It is a distinguished club which appeared in the final of the Scottish junior cup some years ago and has been a training ground for many distinguished footballers. It is disappointing that a small town like Dunbar, which has had such a successful team, has been able to sustain this club only under the considerable difficulties which my hon Friend mentioned. It is a tribute to the town's efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many organisations which are not technically charities require a great deal of help from their supporters, who will have to redouble their efforts to provide the rates which are being charged. I hope that the Minister will hold these consultations speedily and that we can have some indication of his findings before Third Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
T hope that either by letter to my hon Friend or bv a statement at the beginning of one of our sittings, the Minister will let us know his feelings. In some respects the scope is maybe slightly widened, although we have misgivings about the educational category. But on the other categories,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, we are happy that this debate has taken place this morning and we await with interest the Minister's reply in what we hope will be the not-too-distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon Members on both sides of the Committee who have taken part in the debate. Indeed, I am grateful to the Minister for displaying what I thought was a certain amount of sympathy to the spirit if not to the detail of the amendment. Once again it has turned out that my hon Friend on the Front Bench, like my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), has an infinitely more suspicious mind than I have. I must emphasise that when I drafted and tabled the amendment I did not have private schools in mind as likely candidates for statutory rates remission. Having had the misfortune not only to attend a private school but to be at the same school at the same time as the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), the last thing that I would want to do is make life any easier for private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Gourlay, if I make a further comment on private schools. No child of mine will ever go near a private school. They are the most appalling institutions, from every point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of what my hon Friend is suggesting might have been brought within the scope of the clause as amended, I was thinking not of private schools but of organisations such as adult literacy classes or night classes for housewives or anyone else who needs to take advantage of the voluntary educational activities which are of enormous value in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister indicated that he did not think that there was a problem, because representations had not been made to him in his capacity as Minister about the inadequacy of the present arrangements, whereby anybody who wants statutory rates remission has to get clearance from the Inland Revenue rather than from somebody who specialises in social or charitable affairs. The Minister also said that he had had to take up this issue as a constituency Member of Parliament. I think that it follows from that that there must be problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made that point to illustrate that
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
the discretionary system works perfectly well at the present time, so far as I can tell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like me, the Minister has the good fortune to represent part of Lothian region, which has a splendidly benign local authority. I am glad that he has taken this opportunity to pay tribute to Lothian regional council and its excellent attitude towards voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier incarnation I was chairman of a village hall committee in a small rural village in Berwickshire. That little committee had a certain amount of difficulty in getting the paper-work organised in order to qualify for charitable status in order to qualify for statutory rates remission. I think that the Minister has accepted that problems do arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister cannot accept the amendment as it stands. I appreciate also some of my hon Friends' worries that perhaps the amendment is drawn too widely. However, I am grateful to the Minister for his undertaking to give consideration to the factors which have been drawn out during the debate. I hope that he will feel able to give a specific undertaking to consult not only COSLA but also the Scottish Council of Social Service, with a view perhaps to bringing forward an amendment on Report. I therefore, beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not insignificant that the title of the Bill is Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. I suppose that clause 5 comes within the category of a miscellaneous provision. Up to now we have dealt with technical problems which some hon Members have understood better than others, but clause 5 is not a technical clause in the same sense that clauses 1 and 2 are. I wonder what encouraged the Government to put this clause in this Bill and at this time. Perhaps it is because 1981 is the International Year of Disabled People and this is the Government's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause stand part debate will give us the opportunity to discuss, albeit briefly, the whole question of charities—what they are, what they do, how they are defined and what help the Government and local authorities can give them. I recommend the Committee to look at a report produced by the expediture committee five or six years ago on charities. The investigation revolved around the definition of a charity. The report covered the United Kingdom, although it dealt almost entirely with the work of the Charity Commissioners in England. Almost in passing, it commented on the fact that charities were controlled, in so far as they were controlled at all, by the Charity Commissioners in England and by the Inland Revenue in Scotland, although the end result is not dissimilar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of that Committee. In the course of our investigations we were able to visit the offices of the Charity Commisioners in London. It is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
Dickensian institution operated by Dickensian characters, drop-outs from the Civil Service who cannot make the grade. They are hived off to the Charity Commission, and there they sit contentedly until they draw their index-linked pensions. A charity is obliged by law to file its accounts every year, and it is possible to check whether Eton college and other such reputable charities have filed their accounts. In many cases no such accounts had been filed. I invite hon Members to inquire into how the Charity Commissioners operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, at least, that system in England, but I am not aware that there is any such system in Scotland. Where there is a purely Scottish charity, I am not aware that there is any way in which one may have access to the accounts or to the means by which the Inland Revenue seeks some kind of continuous control over charities. In England, any member of the public can complain to the Charity Commissioners and ask them to investigate a charity. The Commissioners will take up that complaint and treat it on its merits. I am not sure that there is any such machinery in Scotland. The clause presumes that there is a satisfactory definition of a charity, either in the Scottish Office or in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mostly rests his case on the fact that the local authority will know whether a body is a bona fide charitable organisation and will exercise its discretion on the matter. But local authorities are not equipped to look at all such cases. There is a multiplicity of bodies organising on a quasi-charitable basis. They may claim a charitable basis from a local authority, but in my view local authorities are not too well equipped to determine whether such bodies are bona fide charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that local authorities would have that problem. In practice, whether an organisation is to be considered charitable is determined on the basis of whether it is considered charitable for tax purposes. Any organisation claiming to be a charity would, if it had been recognised by the Inland Revenue, have a certificate showing that it was entitled to tax deduction because of its charitable status. That is the proof that the local authority could use to satisfy itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, I have another point to raise. I do not know whether the Inland Revenue uses the same yardstick in Scotland as the Charity Commissioners use in England. If a Charity in England engages in what the Commissioners deem to be political lobbying it is not regarded as a charity. Does the Inland Revenue operate in the same way? Most charities work on a United Kingdom basis—the Child Poverty Action Group, Age Concern, and so on; very few are purely Scottish charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two examples will illustrate the difficulty. The British Legion is highly politically motivated. Whenever there is a mention of war pensions in the House —even when we are not discussing war pensions— Members get continual briefing from the British
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
Legion on the desirability of increasing war pensions and allowances. In my view, there is nothing wrong with that. Members of the Child Poverty Action Group, on the other hand, which is concerned with similar matters—lobbying on behalf of one-parent families, for instance—are not deemed to be political lobbyists. At least they were not before my hon Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) became a Member of Parliament. There was no more active lobbyist in the House. He used to pester—if that is the right word—MPs on the case that he wanted to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is a narrow dividing line between what is political lobbying and what is not. The British Legion is deemed not to be a political lobbying instrument, but the Child Poverty Action Group is. Amnesty International is another good example. It is not regarded as a charitable organisation because it is engaged in politics. An organisation which is, nevertheless, operating on a United Kingdom basis might be given charitable status by the Inland Revenue in Scotland and not by the Charity Commissioners in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister what incited the Government to put the clause in the Bill. Were any representations made from charities or local authorities, or did the subject just happen to be in a pigeonhole in the Scottish Office? Did the Government bring it out, dust it down and say "Well, we can put a clause in the miscellaneous provisions Bill, and that will give us a less malodorous atmosphere in the chaitable organisations"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that charities are feeling sore at the Government's treatment of them. On 19 January 	<i>The Times</i> reported that eight major charities had complained direct to the Prime Minister about the iniquitous burden of VAT. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Eight charities yesterday appealed to the Prime Minister as her personal contribution to the International Year of Disabled People, to be relieved of the 'crushing burden' of value-added tax which costs them £1 million annually."</p></blockquote>
Presumably an estimate has been made of the relief that charities will get as a result of the implementation of the clause. Can the Minister say whether that will offset the burden of VAT which the charities in Scotland pay as a direct consequence of the Government's increase in VAT from 8 per cent, to 15 per cent, in their first Budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complaint was made in debates on earlier clauses that we were seeking to bring the law on the rating system in Scotland into line with that in England. According to the Library brief on clause 5, there is no provision for charities in England to be treated in the same flexible way as they are to be treated in Scotland. There seems to be no coordination between the Scottish Office and other Departments in the United Kingdom on the law on charities or on anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will in his spare moments look at the report on charities produced by the Expenditure Committee a few years ago. He may find something there which will enable him at a later date to produce a law which will modernise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
the whole law on charities, if for no other reason than to deal with itihe matter which I raised in an intervention in the speech of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes)—private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no defensible reason why private, fee-paying schools, whether it be Eton, Fattes, or anywhere else, should be relieved of any burden. As the Minister said, in so far as such schools are relieved in that way, the burden falls on others. In other words, other people—probably poorer people—are being asked to foot the Bill so that others can send their kids to private, fee-paying schools. That is an obscenity, and it ought to be put right. The Minister must know—or he should find out—how many private, fee-paying schools, which are not subject to the cuts to which the State educational system has been subject, will benefit from the clause. Does the Minister know how many private, fee-paying schools in Scotland are subject to rate relief under the terms of the existing law on charities? How many will benefit, and by how much, as a result of the implementation of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon Member begins his remarks, may I say that the Chair has been extremely charitable on the clause stand part debate so far. T hope that the hon Gentleman will confine his remarks to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly do that, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been most helpful An responding to the amendment. It is always interesting to hear the confessions of a private school hoy. I 'began to feel quite out of it. Not only is the West of Scotland heavily outnumbered, for once, in Scottish Committee, but there is a wide variety of background among Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what happens when the Government put in a nice, simple clause. It has nothing to do with what we have been discussing, although the amendment was in order. It is to do with the timing of the application for the relief. The Minister has agreed to discuss the matter with COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who suffers the loss of income when relief is given? I suppose I should know, but I have forgotten. What rating authority determines the relief in the first place? Is it the regional authority? Presumably the district authority also loses a portion of rates through that relief. I am trying to stir up Lothian and Edinburgh, or Strathclyde and Glasgow. I genuinely do not know the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to be nodding his head and saying that it is the regional authority which makes the decision, but here we are considering discretion. The clause deals with "charitable organisations". I think that I am right in saying that those are the charitable organisations which have already been accepted by the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is the discretion of the rating authority. I am confused, because the clause refers only to the "rating authority" and there are two rating authorities in Scotland now. Who makes the decisions?
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
Who has the discretion? Is it the regional authority? Have we any information about the loss of income under present practice, either in general terms or from the number of late claims?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses explained that the clause was to tidy up the old system and to enable authorities to fix their rate poundage. This was not done until a few months into the financial year. It was to enable them to calculate the rate poundage based on the knowledge that they would have to give relief to charitable and other organisations which can apply for it. That has all been changed. I should have thought that we would have been given some information to justify making the change, albeit only a tidying up alteration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the loss of rates in Scotland at present from charitable and other organisations on which local authorities can exercise discretion? Is it a significant amount? Does it come into the calculations for rate support grant? In other words, who suffers the loss? Is it only the ratepayers or is there some central Government element?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the look on the faces of some Conservative Members. They do not know the answers either, and are therefore genuinely seeking information. In the light of the Minister's helpful response we should have this information. I should not like to engage in discussions with COSLA if it has a built-in disincentive to be helpful, and so takes a tough line and says "No, we are not going to consider any further discretions. The system is working well and the loss is entirely the ratepayer's."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not thinking about what happened last night in the House. I am genuinely asking these questions as a matter of interest. I welcome clause 5, because it tidies the matter up, together with the assurance that the Minister has given to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will forgive me if I confine my response to the matters which arise directly out of the clause. Hon Gentlemen would have to pursue with Treasury Ministers the general question of the Inland Revenue's attitude towards charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) asked how much revenue was lost through the discretionary use of rate relief. We have no means of knowing this figure, because these sums are not calculated on a central basis. Each individual local authority might be able to make such a calculation. The hon Gentleman might approach an individual local authority which would be able to tell him what use it makes of the discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the effect on overall revenue, local authorities are compensated through the distribution policy of the rate support grant, which means that any loss of resources in individual authorities because of this decision is in practice spread throughout Scotland through the distribution formula of the RSG. The individual authority perhaps loses less than the actual net loss which will flow directly from its rating decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that an authority like Lothian, which has far too many charitable institutions within its boundaries, and which has already suffered as a result of the change in the distribution formula for the RSG, is being unfairly penalised and not being compensated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There is not the remotest justification for anything that the hon Gentleman has just said. Not only is Lothian not being treated unfairly compared to local authorities in the distribution formula— which, after all, is largely a formula agreed by the convention itself in which Lothian is represented— but, in practice, the matter that he is raising about charitable status is separate from the specific point about the discretionary withdrawal of rates liability from a local authority, in which Lothian regional council has the same discretion as any other local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) asked about the genesis of the clause. There are two reasons why the clause has been brought forward now. At the moment, a charity has to apply by 30 June to be able to claim charitable status. The date of 30 June relates to the financial year before the reorganisation of local government, when rate poundages were not fixed until 31 October. Therefore, by requiring charities to apply by 30 June, local authorities had some idea in advance how much potential revenue they would lose because of the charitable status of certain of the organisations within their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at present relief cannot be granted in respect of a period beginning before the financial year in which the application is made. The provisions of the clause will allow a charity to obtain relief not only for the whole of the financial year in which application is made but also for as much of the previous financial year as the organisation was in charitable occupation of the property. This should be of real benefit to charities. The provisions are agreed by the convention, and I have no doubt that, as they are very much to the advantage of charitable organisations, they will be acceptable to all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the clause

relates to remission in respect of lands and heritages which are unoccupied or unfurnished. I have always been led to understand that rates are a tax which is levied on the occupiers of buildings, land or heritages.

But the point is that, before somebody who may own a property but does not occupy it can claim such exemption, there has to be evidence that the property has been unoccupied and unfurnished for at least three months. Up to now, that three-month period has had to fall within a given financial year. If it happened to straddle the end of one financial year and the beginning of the next, although a total of three months might have been complied with it might be one month in one financial year and two months in the next—in both years the person would not have been able to claim exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say to the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) that a number of representations to the Scottish Office over the years have said that this is an unfair anomaly, because, if three months is the period, it should not make any difference in which financial year they fall. After discussions with the convention, it was agreed that this would be a sensible reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain how a non-existent person can claim a rates remission?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like a good point, but I am afraid that it is not. The hon Gentleman assumes that a property is unoccupied only when the owner is unknown, or when there is no owner. However, a property may be owned but not occupied by its owner. For example, someone may buy a house that takes him six or nine months to rehabilitate and refurnish. That house could lie empty for some time. Someone may buy a house before he has sold his own, and the sale may take much longer than anticipated. The new house could easily lie empty for more than three months before he is able to occupy it. In such cases, the owners are known, but it would be unfair to expect them to pay rates on the unoccupied property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to have it both ways.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident that the hon Gentleman does not understand. Clearly, the problem does not arise in the case of a non-existent owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Mr. X has bought a property but, for one reason or another, he has not occupied it and the property has lain empty and unfurnished for a certain time. If that period is three months or longer, the owner can claim a degree of rating relief, on the grounds that rates are a tax on occupation. If he has not occupied the house— he may be occupying another house—it is not appropriate to expect him to pay rates. The existing law deals with that situation, and our amendment of it means simply that that three-month period can extend over the boundary between one financial year and another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 5, line 19,leave out from "justified" to end of line 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister's note on the amendment will tell him to inform me that we are making a mistake here. Our amendment would extend the powers of the Secretary of State so that he could make the change for any reason, not just because of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a change in the value of money."</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with an exception to the instalment method of paying rates. The clause stipulates that any sum less than £20 will have to be paid as prescribed by the rating authority. Our amendment is probably defective. Nevertheless, we wish to probe the issue with which it deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that there is now no power to demand instalments when the total due is less than £20. Are we dealing with a major problem? I can think of scarcely anyone whose rating liability would be less than £20 a year. I see that the 1975 Act still specified 5p. Clearly, if the money value specified is to have any relevance, it must be updated. The order will be subject to the negative procedure. I simply suggest that evidence should be available to justify the Secretary of State taking the power and updating the £20 limit. We should be told what figure he has in mind. However, I suppose that we shall be told once again that such matters will be discussed at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on the reason behind the clause? The hon Gentleman doubted whether many people would have rate demands of less than £20 a year. However, two categories of people are likely to receive such demands. For those who pay rates separately on small lock-up garages, demands of that size are not unusual. The second major category is those who received substantial rate rebates. Although the original rate assessment may be well over £20, a rebate can reduce liability to below £20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman's amendment seeks to remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a change in the value of money"</p></blockquote>
in order to give a wider discretion, so that it could be either for that reason or any other purpose. Not only is
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
the hon Gentleman's amendment acceptable in principle, but we have been unable to discover any drafting errors. I am, therefore, happy to recommend its acceptance to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was drafted by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I am sure that he had no idea, either, that it would be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be quite clear what we are now doing. I assume that we are giving the Secretary of State power to produce an order which would not be limited to £20, or some other figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for any amendment being accepted, however trivial it may be. But is there an early intention to use the power, because £20 is out of date? What are the other possible reasons for the Secretary of State using the power which the amendment confers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see why the hon Gentleman wishes to be reassured that the Government's enthusiasm for the amendment is not a matter for suspicion. The main purpose of clause 7 is to prevent the collection by instalments of sums under £20 because that can cost a local authority more than it actually receives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new subsection (7C) in clause 7 is to ensure that a change can be made in line with any change in the value of money. The amendment correctly suggests that there may be other sensible reasons why a change in the figure would be appropriate at a specific time. Rather than requiring primary legislation, the procedure outlined in the clause is more sensible. We were convinced by the hon Gentleman's amendment, even if he has not yet been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is attributable to the arithmetical powers of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who is unfortunately not with us today. Doing my simple arithmetic last night, I discovered that the Government intend to introduce an increase of about 5 per cent., and we want to know why this dramatic rise is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that at present there are about 108,000 appeals in hand. The clause will, therefore, result in increased revenue to local authorities. Will that be set against the rate support grant allocation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also just a wee bit perturbed that the Government are increasing the figure and are, therefore, proposing a more modest increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon Friend explained, the amendment is from "nine" to "eight", which is still
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
slightly more than "three-quarters of the difference".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a major point, but the law is being changed in the Bill, and I hope that the Minister can provide some justification for it. For example, the Secretary of State has further extended the period for appeals in the 1978 revaluation that are still under way. What is the basis for this clause? Is it a money argument again? Who has been losing out? Has it been the appellant or the rating authority, and are there figures that would convince us that we should make a change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has fully understood the effect of the clause. He suggested that his amendment would make the position more modest. In our view, it would perhaps be over-generous to the ratepayer, because, although the clause in its present form benefits the ratepayer, we have sought to keep a balance between his interests and those of the local authority as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan asked why we have the clause. I must tell him that at present the method of calculating an abatement due to an appellant while his appeal against rateable value is being considered is extremely complex, as anyone can see. The formula is very complex, and rating authorities have informed us that they have met with practical difficulties in operating it. Rather surprisingly, some local authority computers cannot maintain on record the amount due in the previous year, so the calculations have to be done manually, and rating authorities have accordingly sought a revised and more simple formula. The new formula is simpler.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula proposed in the clause as at present drafted would in most cases be more generous to ratepayers than the present arrangement. Despite that, local authorities welcome it because it is a simplified procedure. Local authorities do, however, have an interest in ensuring that they are not over-generous to an appellant. Not only would it interfere with their cash flow. It would encourage far more appeals, because people would be able to withhold part of their rates until their appeals had been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly one is anxious to ensure that appeals are forthcoming only when there is a genuine point of dispute and not because there might be a short-term financial benefit to the ratepayer in withholding a proportion of his rates by making a spurious appeal when he knew that there were no good grounds for doing so. If it were made over-generous so that someone could withhold a substantial proportion of his rates liability because of having appealed against rateable value, it could encourage just that kind of action. That is a state of affairs about which local authorities would be very unhappy. Therefore, we have made a provision which meets the local authorities' requirement by simplifying the formula. It, incidentally, also happens to benefit ratepayers, which is an agreeable situation. But we do not wish to go further than that because it would pose significant problems for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 5, line 39, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any such alteration must be intimated to the occupier of the affected lands and heritages prior to the commencement of the local authority financial year in which such alteration is to have effect and if such intimation is not made the said alteration shall not take effect till the local authority financial year immediately subsequent to the year in which such intimation is made".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. We are not clear about the Government's motives. In discussions with my local authority in the Central Region, the valuer gave conflicting advice. A report by the Director of Administration and Legal Services states in respect of clause 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Administratively this is a desirable simplification which will save much work and it is envisaged that the resultant loss in income will not be significant."</p></blockquote>
The advice of the local authority assessor in respect of clause 9 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Clause provides that the rating consequences of a house valuation being altered upwards shall be effective only from the year following after the material change. This will add to the Assessor's work and will involve maintaining additional records and the possibility of setting up an additional computer file."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that is the same computer that cannot work out fractions. The assessor's comments continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to achieve administrative savings at least to the Rating Authority it will be necessary for the Assessor to alter values during the year in which the improvements are made, otherwise the effort of making a supplementary demand would not be avoided—merely delayed. One consequence of this Clause will be the need for Assessors to 'log-up' the changes for ultimate injection in a body on the 1st April. So far as houses are concerned, this provision brings us back fairly close to the 1956 Act pattern, and calls in question the need for the much maligned running roll."</p></blockquote>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects we appreciate the motivation behind the amendment, but from one authority there are two conflicting views and clearly the Minister has come down on the side of one. The only way to avoid such a log-jam at the beginning of the year is to have some sort of unofficial running roll. In effect, we are legislating for a change from an official running roll to an unofficial one. Those who are mostly directly affected are the assessors. They will have to carry on with the same job, but perhaps they will have to use scrap paper instead of official forms. I believe that the Minister is imposing an unsatisfactory burden on local authorities. For those reasons, I should be interested to hear his views on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon Gentlemen's remarks. I cannot call into question what he may have been told by an individual assessor, but I can tell him that the proposals are the result of the working party's recommendations. The Scottish assessors were represented on that, and they were as much in favour of the clause as other representatives of local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
authority interests. So far as I am aware, there was a unanimous recommendation, and perhaps that is not surprising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view the clause is beneficial to ratepayers, local authorities and assessors. It has been a longstanding grievance, when there has been a minor improvement or alteration during the course of a year, that the ratepayer receives a supplementary demand for an additional rate sum, which often is trivial. It is doubtful whether issuing such a request is of advantage to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, an analysis of running roll entries for 1977 prepared by the director of finance of Strathclyde for the sub-regions of Glasgow, Lanark and Ayr showed 48,000 alterations. Just over 16,000 of those were increases in rateable value, and 13,500 had an effective rateable value of less than £10. The sort of sums that were being demanded were very trivial; it was not really in the local authority's interest to insist on collecting them mid-term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessors also felt that they would no longer be constrained to amend the roll as early as possible. That took the pressure off them, so to speak, and domestic ratepayers will clearly benefit because of the removal of the obligation to pay a supplementary demand during the course of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to penalise a rating authority for the assessor's failure to issue valuation notices before the end of the year to those householders whose property had increased in value during that year. The penalty would be the loss of a year's rates on the amount of the increase. The hon Gentleman did not really speak to his amendment and indicated that, in effect, it was a probing one. I assure him that it would penalise local authorities—unfairly, in our view—and I believe that, with hindsight, he would not wish to insist on his amendment. With regard to the clause itself, so far as we are aware, assessors, local authorities and those representing ratepayers' interests are all in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I may have completely misunderstood the purpose of the clause and the amendment. But I have the impression that, unless it is amended, the clause will create a tremendous loophole which many domestic ratepayers may take advantage of. If running rolls, or whatever, are to be done away with, it will be possible for occupiers of property to avoid paying rates on the increased valuation during the rating year in which that comes into effect. Would it not therefore become possible for anyone building a greenhouse, installing central heating, adding a garage or some other extension to improve his property, to ensure that he did so some time in the month of April, thereby ensuring a rates holiday for himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as someone had a rates holiday, that would not be on the whole property. It would be only on that part of the property which had been improved. As I indicated, the sums involved tend to be so small that the local authorities are quite willing to forgo them because of the administrative savings they make in consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will give the Committee the answer. I am not suggesting that there is anything suspicious about the working party. I presume that it has something to do with the assessors, the surveyors institute or someone concerned with the day-to-day working of valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to refer to the point raised by my hon Friend. I should declare an interest here, because I am in the process of doing a little work on my house, which will be the subject of an additional liability. 1 hope that after non-reporting by the press for nearly a year and a half 1 will not have advantage taken of me and have the 	<i>Daily Record</i> ask "What is Brown up to now?" I should like to explain the mechanics to the Minister, because the matter is quite important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman is dealing with thousands of cases. I do not know what are the sums involved, but I suspect that this is another example of someone who wants a nice, quiet easy life, and the computer cannot cope with these cases. I am a simple-minded guy who always thought the purpose of technology was to provide a better service, but I suspect that this is yet another example where the machine literally cannot cope with all the wee bits and pieces. Perhaps the Minister can answer my question. I shall explain it from my circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with what I presume will be every ratepayer and owner-occupier in Strathclyde, I have just completed my annual return. Let me suppose that in completing it I had stated that there had been no alteration to my property. There has not been, but I know that that it is due to start next week or next month. Let me further suppose that I said "Wait a wee minute. I shall fiddle this around until after 1 April". That would be quite legitimate, and I do not believe that I would be breaking the law. It may be possible that I would be breaking the present law, but I would not be breaking the future law. However, if there are a number of alert citizens, architects, consultants who advise people, we are talking about quite a few pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
I shudder to think what could happen to me because of a minor improvement. Peter Doig, former Member for Dundee, West, used to go on at great length if even a central heating system was installed. That, too, is relevant if somebody says "Wait a wee minute. If I do this on 1 April, or whenever the financial year starts, I will get relief and will not pay additional rates until the following year".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us watch what we are doing. I am in favour of giving these concessions, but I suspect that this is a working party of people who just do not want the additional work involved. I do not think that we should accept that, willy-nilly, without some scrutiny. I know that it is expensive, because two men in a car came up to inspect what T was doing simply because they were told by building control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that something does not require building control. How does the authority get to know about it? Presumably—I think that I am right—it knows by the annual return. I am not questioning people's honesty—there are penalties if one does not tell the truth when asked whether there has been a change. 1 am suggesting that there is now some pressure on people. They may be told "Don't do that work in March. Do it in May and you will save yourself a few bob." I am not really against that happening—it is not a major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am a little surprised that we have no knowledge of that working party, whether this has been done with the approval of the rating authorities as distinct from the valuation authorities and whether COSLA has beeta involved. In the light of the £26,000 or £30,000 involved in Strathclyde, the saving could add up to a pound or two. I think that we should have a little more information about what is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The working party concerned is the Local Government finance working party, which is part of the normal consultative machinery between the Secretary of State and the convention. Many points of technical detail often arise and instead of full meetings with the Secretary of State dealing with these matters, these working parties are used. This is the same party from which I am sure that the hon Gentleman must have heard reports or recommendations and on which the convention, the Department and any other interested bodies are represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon Gentleman is right about the matter that causes him concern. It may be an advantage for a person carrying out a particular improvement to delay it for a few weeks or months as a result of the clause, but, first, we are talking about very small sums, and secondly, we are not discussing a point of principle —there is no question of ethics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that the local authority cannot cope with the administration, as it is doing it at the moment—it is not a question of the computer being unable to do it. If, because of the small sums involved, it often costs local authorities more to deal with the administration than the sums which they are receiving, we are experiencing one of those fortunate coincidences of having a change that will save the local authority money in some respects. That will obviously be welcomed by the ratepayer, and nobody will lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Gentleman is correct and one or two
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
things are delayed for a few weeks or months, we obviously do not wish to encourage that. But the benefits to the local authority outweigh these relatively minor disadvantages.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to retain for local authorities a majority on the appropriate body. The Scottish Valuation Advisory Council hitherto has had a majority of local authority nominees, and we feel that this is desirable. We are dubious about Government's intentions to increase the size of the body without guaranteeing a majority to that section which, to all intents and purposes, has the greatest interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know the reasons for the change. We have suspicions—I put it no more strongly—that there may be an opportunity for the Secretary of State to introduce to the body people from somewhat dubious organisations, like ratepayers associations. I say "dubious" because they are bodies which very rarely nowadays stand for public election but, in their self-appointed manner, see fit to defend people, often without the consent of the ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that our suspicions are ill-founded in this respect. If they are, we shall be grateful for the Minister's assurances. We feel that a body of this nature, so directly involved with local authorities, should have from the local authorities the substantial membership that it has enjoyed in the past. If the membership of the council is to be increased, we should like assurances that local authorities can retain their present strength on that body.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to the subject on clause stand part, but I think those questions are appropriate to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to comment on the points that have been raised. The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) is right. At present not less than eight nor more than 10 of the total of 15 members of the council are nominated as a matter of practice by the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the changes proposed in the clause is twofold. First, the present membership of the council was established by the 1956 Act and since then, because of the reorganisation of local government, the number of valuation authorities has decreased dramatically. Hon Members will appreciate that before reorganisation there was a much larger number of rating authorities in Scotland. Therefore, the justification for a higher proportion of representatives of local authorities on the council was clear and undisputed. We now have a relatively small number of valuation authorities— essentially the regional and islands councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the council has lost one of its original functions—that of considering administrative schemes for valuation in each area. This was thought to be a function which provided some justification for a majority of local authority representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council is not a political body. It is a valuation advisory council and exists essentially to give technical advice to the Secretary of State. It does not meet very often. I do not suggest that this clause introduces a major or very significant reform, but it was felt that the balance should be altered in this fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee. 1 should like briefly to ask the Minister a few questions. He will appreciate a number of Government members of the Committee are always anxious when they see bodies of this sort being increased. I understood him to say that the functions of the Valuation Advisory Council had diminished, and in that light it seems surprising that he is seeking to increase its membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
My first question is: why is it being increased? Secondly, as it is being increased by someone who presumably is not appointed or nominated by the valuation authority and will therefore be a layman, a lawyer or similar person, who will be able to be remunerated under the original legislation, can he give an idea of the expected increase in the cost of running this body? At a time when it is Government policy to try to reduce quangos—this is not strictly a quango because it is advisory—this matter should be clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to intrude on the ideological arguments that take place inside the Conservative Party about when a quango is not a quango. I should have thought that in the light of our ignorance of valuation there would be a role for some kind of advisory body, if for no other reason than to translate a very technical subject into layman's language, so that the public may understand their rights, never mind that a matter might be referred to it by the Secretary of State, or after with consultation with COSLA or the assessors. I do not assume that because a body does not meet often, it is not of some relevance and importance, so perhaps the Minister can expand on its role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on the clause state that of the 15 members of the council
	<br><blockquote><p>"not less than 8 or more than 10 are to be appointed from a panel of persons (other than assessors) nominated by associations representing valuation authorities (in practice, COSLA). The remainder are to include persons experienced in law or in valuation."</p></blockquote>
Members of the council are appointed for five years but are eligible for reappointment. In the last available report dated 31 December 1979 I saw names that departed from the local government scene some time ago. Therefore, it is appropriate that the Minister should not abolish it—not that the hon Gentleman suggested that—but look at it. Its always useful to have an awkward Member—even though it might be the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram)— asking what it is doing and how often it meets. There is nothing wrong with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am getting mixed up again because we are changing the total from 15 to 16 and reducing it from eight to six. In other words, under the convention, fewer members will be nominated. The Minister has justified that by saying that there are fewer valuation authorities, which is true. But I tend to believe that laymen— meaning elected representatives—are much more valuable than any other group. Clearly, professional expertise is available in the council and presumably, even though a profession might not be represented, the council would have access to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should realise that six is the minimum, not the maximum, number of local authority representatives. There is no reason why at any time there could not be a greater number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably it is still the case that members must be appointed other than from a panel of assessors—not less than six and not more than 10. I assume that there is a reason for dropping the number to six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was felt inappropriate for any body
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
to have an automatic statutory majority. By having a minimum of eight, that would have been guaranteed, but that would have been unfortunate, whichever body it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but am I not right in assuming that if the maximum membership is limited to 16, the Secretary of State is still left with the discretion to accept the majority from COSLA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon Gentleman is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Secretary of State any intention of putting the elected members in a minority? Why is there concern? Why is there to be a change? The Minister has not given any justification for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council was involved in a matter of great public concern. It involved the auditors' access to assessors' records. I think that the present Lord Advocate was involved in that case. We probably do not pay enough attention to such matters. There would be an advisory committee which met only once a year. Unusually, a meeting on 14 January was included in the annual report to December 1979 because of its importance. Nevertheless, the council still produced a report which I think was sent to all Members of Parliament. It covers many matters which the Committee has discussed— about timetables for appeal, minor amendments to legislation affecting valuation and valuation to net annual value. This is the first time we have really appreciated that there is such a body that could have been the basis for some of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of representations about quangos, does the Minister intend to abolish the advisory council? Does he intend to change its composition? Perhaps changes have been made in the last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, is there any reason, other than a technical point, for ensuring that the Secretary of State would have the power to put local authority representatives in a minority? That is the basic change that the Minister is asking the Committee to endorse, but I am reluctant to agree to that in the light of all the stramash that is going on with local authorities at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to exaggerate or to cause excessive alarm, but the Committee needs a serious justification if it is to give power to the Secretary of State to put local authority convention representatives in a minority on a body that seems to have worked harmoniously for years—so well, in fact, that very few knew of its existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Friend, I think that the clause looks fairly innocuous, but the more one examines it, the more suspicious one becomes. Under the existing provision a majority of local authority representatives is guaranteed. That is,no longer to be the case. The new provision will empower the Secretary of State to keep the local authority representatives on the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council in a minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a reason for that. It does not just appear out of the blue. Has the mysterious working party recommended that? Where did the proposal originate? We have not been told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For once I agree very much with the remarks of the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). Basically, I am against quangos because there is an element of patronage, to a greater or lesser degree, in all of them. I dislike patronage—perhaps because I have not been a beneficiary of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would you like, Willie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have put my claims in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the council has not met, or if it meets only once or twice a year, that seems to be an adverse reflection on its work. That might not be true. It might meet to discuss very important matters on one or two occasions. However, prima facie, it looks as if it is not a terribly important body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us how much the council costs? What was the cost last year, or the year before, for example? What are the expenses of individual members? How are they paid? Are they paid a daily rate, a monthly rate, or just their expenses? I do not know the answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the effect of the council's abolition? Would there be a revolution among local authorities if this body were suddenly abolished? I doubt it very much. My hon Friend has greater experience than I have on such matters. He implied that the council did valuable work and would do valuable work in the future—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
