	<p>10.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had shown, before the break, that the so-called independent schools received much public support through public money and not just through the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like some further details on the hon. Gentleman's views. Would he apply the same logic to trade union colleges which are registered charities and also have public assistance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should need to ask the hon. Gentleman to cite specific examples. However, if he means, say, Ruskin college or New Battle Abbey college, I should agree with him. I am sure that both those colleges—I am aware that this is so in New Battle Abbey college— are run by a majority, if not a totality, of local authority and other public nominees. The hon. Gentleman might care to check the board of New Battle Abbey college. It would provide a very good model for what I suggest. The hon. Gentleman has been most helpful in drawing that parallel, and I hope that Conservative Members have taken note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funds available to the so-called independent schools do not just include money for the assisted places schemes. Moneys for training teachers, rate relief, tax benefits and other benefits are derived from their charitable status. Let us examine the governing bodies of those schools which receive so much public assistance. Let us take one or two examples of the people who administer the schools, who are responsible for this public money and assistance, to see whether they are subject to public accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
shall take three examples only to illustrate my argument. First, there is Fettes College. As I said on another occasion, I had the interesting opportunity of serving on the governing board of that college. At that time, I was its only publicly responsible person who was elected by a universal franchise. My successor as chairman of the Lothian regional council—councillor John Young—is a board member. He is one such member out of a dozen and he has no real opportunity of influencing what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from experience that the other members represent bodies such as the Faculty of Advocates and the old Fettesian club which have no degree of public accountability. The most noticeable aspect of these private schools is how many old boys there are on their boards of governors. One of the principal qualifications for serving on the board of governors seems to be that one should have attended that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>696</span>
I find it strange that people who attended a school should want to retain a connection with it and be responsible for running it in such a way. I should prefer parents of pupils—indeed, some senior pupils themselves—to have some responsibility for what happens in the school. Above all, they should be people who are publicly responsible and accountable for the financial assistance given to the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example is Merchiston Castle school, where the governing board is described as consisting of governors elected by Merchistonians. That comes first— all the boys of the school, that incestuous relationship which is built up in a school in which former pupils keep running the school and, of course, encourage the sons and daughters, and, in some cases, the grandsons and great-grandsons, of previous pupils at the school. It is that sort of self-perpetuating control. The other bodies represented on the school governors' board are the universities, of course. These include the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Faculty of Advocates, the Society of Writers to the Signet, and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. These are eminently respectable bodies. Part of this is the Edinburgh Mafia that I was talking about earlier, which the Minister knows so well, the new club Mafia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and last example that I draw to the Committee's attention is Loretto school, which is probably the most disgraceful example of self-perpetuation in terms of governors that I have ever come across. All the governors are old Lorettonians. It is a brilliant example of self-perpetuation in an incestuous relationship. All these schools are taking public money, with teachers trained at public expense, getting tax and rate concessions and obtaining all these benefits from the taxpayer and ratepayer in order to provide privileged education for their sons and grandsons. That is basically what they are doing. If such schools are to be registered under these provisions, which give them the sort of public assistance and benefits that we are talking about, they should have public accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way to do that is by getting the representatives of the local education authority in whose area a school is situated on the board. As I have said, this is not a party political argument. In the case of the schools in Grampian and Tayside, those people will be nominated by Conservative-controlled authorities, and that is right. They are the elected authorities in those areas. I suggest that it should be the education authority members because they are elected with a public responsibility, indeed, a duty under the Act, to provide education in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent schools form part of the educational provision within those areas. Therefore it is right that these authority officials should take on the extra responsibility of sitting on the governing boards of the so-called independent schools. Thereby, these officials would play an important part in liaising between the independent sector, while it still exists, and the local authority sector. They would provide useful understanding between the two sectors, as well as providing a degree of control and public accountability by having the majority of representatives on the governing boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not exclude some old boys being on the boards. It would not exclude parents, or any other category being represented. Indeed, I would hope that such categories would continue to be represented. But
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>697</span>
it would mean that the majority representation would come from the directly-elected body responsible for education in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the independent schools, nor do I like the public money, tax concessions, rate relief and so on being given to them. I do not like these schools. I have made clear on a number of occasions that I should like to see them integrated into the local authority system and for us to have a totally-public system. But while we have them, and while they are receiving public money, it seems right to me that they should be under control and supervision by the publicly-elected authority, and the amendment is designed to achieve that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 226 would require the deregistration of any independent school which, by 1st January 1982, did not have a majority of education authority nominees on its governing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is by no means uncommon, as the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will know, for the board of governors of an independent school to include among its members representatives of education authorities. Indeed, the hon. Member has, since joining the Committee last Thursday and in his maiden speech to the Committee, pointed out that he served on the boards of three independent schools, so we already know the achievements that obviously give him the most pride from the number of times that he has mentioned them to the Committee in just a couple of sittings. I do not object to that at all. I think that it is a good thing to have a reasonable mix of experience and expertise on the governing body of any establishment, and that includes, in the case of independent schools, members of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is a different matter when an education authority has a majority of members on the board of an independent school. The strength of the independent sector lies in its freedom to operate without the State education system—a point which has been discussed in a number of education debates. As I have said before, the private sector in education makes an important contribution to education generally, simply through its independence. If that were not so, the hon. Member for South Ayrshire would not have gone to a private school and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) would not have chosen to teach in a private school. I do not chide them for that. Clearly, the hon. Member for Cathcart and the parents of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire had a choice, a freedom and an experience in which they wished to participate. We do not wish to accept amendment No. 226, therefore. It would reduce and restrict the choice which both of those hon. Gentlemen have been able to take advantage of in their own education experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 221 is unnecessary because the purpose of this part of the Bill is to facilitate the registration of grant-aided schools, which are clearly affected by the terms of the Bill, and their transition to independent status. The grant-aided schools are already subject to requirements that ensure good standards of teaching, accommodation and other matters compatible with those by which the independent schools are measured for the purposes of registration. It would be wasteful to require a grant-aided school to make specific application for registration at the appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>698</span>
time, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State does not, therefore, propose to do so. However, in order to deal with cases where a school does not happen to be up to scratch in any aspect, the Registrar will have power to accord provisional registration until such time as the deficient matter is rectified and final registration can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are therefore unnecessary. We recognise the validity of the argument in both cases—the need, on the one hand to, have a good mix of representation on the board and, on the other, the need, expressed in amendment No. 221 to make sure that inspection and registration are taken seriously. That is the case in the provisions of the Bill, and I suggest, therefore, that the amendment be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed the point of amendment No. 226. He suggests that, much as we may wish to see it, it would not be the case, if a majority of members were nominated by the education authority in whose area the school was situated, that somehow or other the control of that school would pass into the hands of the local authority and become a local authority school. That is not what the amendment says, even though my hon. Friend and I might wish it to be so. What it does mean, however, is that where a body is receiving public money—it may not be receiving that money from the local authority—either through the assisted-places scheme or through other forms of rate or taxation relief as a charitable organisation, all the representatives whom the authority nominates—it does not follow from the amendment that they must be elected members of the local authority; the amendment states merely that they must be "nominated by the education authority"—should have the major responsibility of ensuring that the public money received by the organisation is spent properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister implied that if a majority of members were nominated by the education authority that would necessarily destroy a school's freedom to operate as it wished. However, in my view it would bring to the board a considerably wider experience and a fresher view of education, not limited by one school or one type of school as are the experience and views of the average board at present. New ideas and new approaches would be introduced that could do much to improve the quality and range of education supplied by the schools concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a small, perhaps a rather trivial example of what I mean. On the revised board, instead of people who all played rugby at school and want the boys to do the same, there may be a few people who played soccer as boys. I played rugby myself, but why should soccer not be offered as an option for the boys? In many such schools soccer is not available, and it would be a good thing if it were. It would be good for such new ideas and methods to be introduced. A fresh approach would be brought to the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition there would be public accountability. Public money is already available to those schools, and it will become more available in the future. It should be entrusted to those who represent taxpayers and ratepayers at local level. We do not wish Parliament to start nominating people—although Parliament may in some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>699</span>
ways seem the obvious body—so we rely on the nearest elected representatives capable of implementing public accountability, the local government representatives. They would be accountable to the general public for the ways in which public money was used by the independent schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must reply to a couple of points raised by the Under-Secretary, especially, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said earlier, the whole day has been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know how the Under-Secretary of State must feel by now, but he could be elsewhere doing other things—indeed, we should all welcome that. However, as my hon. Friend said, the day has been marked by a succession of gratuitous personal insults from his colleague. When we make remarks about him they are about his performance in Committee or his attitude to education as evidenced by what he says about the Bill. I have made no comments about his professional background, his education or his parents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should not even consider doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very sensitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of sensitivity. If the Minister does not realise what it is a question of, that tells us something about him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us put it on the record once and for all that my colleagues and I are concerned with principles in education. The word "principles" may cause the Under-Secretary a sharp intake of breath. That gives away the fact that he neither understands nor appreciates them. Nevertheless, we are prepared for our principles to be demonstrated by where we send our children to school. That is the choice that we have made. I challenge the Under-Secretary to take us on—to ask, even to look up and check, where we send our children to school. That will show our faith in the education system that, after the next election, we shall have the responsibility of running.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been generous with the hon. Gentleman, but having put that matter on the record he must return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hunt, for being generous enough to allow me to reply to the remarks made by the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the school on the governing board of which I said that I had served. I said that with no degree of pride; it was a duty which I undertook as a public representative as chairman of the education committee. If we consider the two schools and the board that has a responsibility for a number of schools, the interesting point about George Heriot school is that it had a majority of representatives of the education authority, but the Government, at the request of the board of George Heriot school, altered the composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Minister is covering up the fact that,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>700</span>
far from accepting anything like the principle of what is suggested in my amendment, or saying whether there is anything in it at all, in the case of George Heriot school he has encouraged the move away from public representation and public accountability. In the case of the Merchant Company, which, as the Minister knows, has responsibility for a number of schools in Edinburgh, the number of local authority representatives formed a very small percentage, and are a very small percentage of the boards of governors. In the case of Fettes it is only one out of 12, which in no way can be seen as being any sort of meaningful public accountability. There are dozens of other examples, including the notable case of Loretto, where there are no public representatives at all—they are all old boys who are living off the fat of the land as far as their privileged education is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the Minister gives away a lot of his beliefs and attitudes by his snide remarks, he gives away a great deal more about his lack of principle by the way in which he deals with amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. A starred amendment, amendment No. 222, was included on the Amendment Paper.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am against clause 10 for the simple reason that it relaxes the existing regulations about the registration of independent schools. It would be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>701</span>
absolutely unjustifiable if, in any circumstances, a person was allowed to run a school, pending registration by the Secretary of State, but before registration had been accepted. Clause 10 provides that as long as one has put in an application one can go on running the school for one month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent upon the Minister to tell us why he has put in clause 10. Does he have in mind, for example, that once the grant aid is phased out, an existing grant-aided school will then become independent? As my hon. Friend for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said, they are not really independent because, apart from all the tax relief and everything else, they will also get money through the assisted-places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister intend simply to allow a grant-aided school, once its grant aid has run out, to apply to be registered as an independent school, and so for what may be a monthly transitional period, in order to preserve some continuity, he has tabled the clause? Alternatively, does he envisage some mug with no qualifications deciding to start his own school, enrolling children, and so on, possibly taking money from parents whilst subjecting their children to inferior educational standards and facilities? Such a person could continue running that educational fiasco for at least a month as long as he had an application for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister envisage with the inclusion of the clause? Is it the transitional stage from one type of school to another, a type of school previously granted in moving towards independent status? Or is it the situation of a new school being started? The Minister is nodding, so I take that as a nod of assent. He should explain, because it would be unthinkable for anyone to be given a licence, as it were, to open a school without the facilities in that school being tested and approved without the teaching qualifications of the staff being tested, examined and approved. Then, possibly, at a future date, the school would be able to apply for more public money by way of the assisted-places scheme, and soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought to come clean and tell us why he is allowing this to happen. If registration means anything, it is that there is some form of ministerial approval for what is going on in the school. A criminal could run a school for up to a calendar month. The Minister may say "It is only one month's grace while we deal with the application". Knowing the slowness of his replies and the slowness of the bureaucrats at St. Andrew's House, particularly the Scottish Education Department, I cannot imagine them dealing with an application in one month. It might take them much longer to assess what is taking place in a school. They would go along and look at the school to see what kind of standards were kept and whether the children were being given adequate educational facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is being irresponsible. He spoke earlier about a parent's charter and so on. If he really has the parents' and the children's interests at heart he should never give a licence—however provisional—to someone to run a school. There have been cases in this country of irresponsible people in responsible positions in schools in the private sector, and partly because of the lack of supervision and the lack of inspection by the Scottish Education Department, those people have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>702</span>
been in a position to take a loan of children and to abuse them.

We ought to be strict in this regard and not allow any independent school to have a provisional form of registration, even for a month, until such time as the Secretary of State is satisfied that that school is up to standard. I would not give such a school registration in any circumstances because of the views that I have previously expressed. If such schools are to exist under the Tory Government, that Government ought to ensure that no registration is given to a person or group of persons whose educational worthiness is unproven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are few occasions on which I agree with the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), but I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Minister what is intended by the clause. I have—for once—some reservations about its wording, and the reasons have been aptly put. It seems odd that under the clause a person would be able to set up a school for the period of a month. As has been said, if that is the Government's intention, it could mean danger to some children. But, of course, as usual the hon. Gentleman may have taken the provision out of context. Therefore I ask the Minister to give us the clarification required to ensure that the safety of children would be preserved should such a school be opened with one month's grace before the registration is accepted or denied to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak against the clause as it stands. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is not present—I am sure that he has been delayed on some important matter. 1 can remember him raising a case on an adjournment debate in the House—my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was also present. I am not entirely clear about the details of the case, but if I remember rightly it was about someone who had run a special school for handicapped children in his constituency and, having gone bankrupt, having left staff unpaid and having created considerable difficulties for parents with children at the school, was considering establishing a similar school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. I think that I am right about those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, such a person can set up his school —provided that he has the property and is not already guilty of certain offences in the management of previous schools—and bring into it some children who are the most susceptible to damage in our society. He can dupe parents, who are desperately concerned about their children, to place their children there. For one month, perhaps even longer if the inspection takes longer, he can have those children under his control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that that is the right way to operate. The correct way would be for someone to apply to establish a school, but before he could bring any children into that school he ought to prove to the Secretary of State that his school has proper premises, is properly equipped with books and materials, and that the teaching staff are qualified to deal with the children to be taught in that school. When he has been able to prove to the Secretary of State or his advisers that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>703</span>
can comply with those conditions, and when they are satisfied that everything has been done, the person should then be able to advertise to bring children into the school, but certainly not before then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if a person advertises and gets children in, takes the first term's fees and then the inspectors say "We cannot allow you to have this school"? The parents then have to take their children away, because the school will be closed. Presumably they will then have to claim the money they have spent from the person or persons running the school. If those persons had invested money in order to set the school up and their capital had disappeared because they were not allowed to run the school, they could not repay the parents. Therefore, some parents who had in good faith paid fees to have their children educated at that school would find that their money was lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely somebody who in a previous incarnation was an accountant would not allow that sort of financial organisation to take place. The Minister cannot be serious in saying that the clause means—at least on the surface—what it implies, namely, that for one month people can set up such a school and then an inspector can close it down if necessary. That is what the clause says. If that is what it means, I am not prepared to vote for it. I shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) referred to the registration of grant-aided schools as independent schools. I remind him that in clause 9 we covered that part of the transition of the existing grant-aided schools to independent schools, but that in clause 10 we are dealing entirely with the registration of independent schools. The present position on registration is that any school which applies for registration is automatically accorded provisional registration. The terms of the 1980 Act require the Registrar of Independent Schools in Scotland to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty here is that a school cannot be inspected until it is functioning. The period is one month. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) shakes his head. I have listened to all that he has said during the past few minutes, and before he reaches a conclusion, which he is never hasty to do in the Committee, he should hold on a little longer and consider the problem that faces the Registrar and HMI when considering an application for a provisional licence for a school. Until the school has been set up and is running, it is extremely difficult to judge its capability. To put it another way, its capability can be properly judged only when it is operating fully as a school. The provisional period is short, and I freely admit that it is undesirable, but if one is learning to drive a car there is a period with a provisional licence before a full licence is accorded. I agree that it is possible that, during a period of provisional licence, the proprietor of a school could do some damage. But a person learning to drive a car on a provisional licence can also do extreme damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to tighten the period of the provisional licence to the minimum possible. Anyone starting a school, knowing these requirements, is putting considerable funds at stake and must know that. Therefore, his intention must be to meet the requirements laid down by HMI. If he fails to do so, he will lose the funds that he has invested in the school. That penalty should at least be a sobering thought for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>704</span>
anyone thinking of entering the private sector of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 makes it an offence to conduct an independent school which is not registered, although it may be impractical to apply for registration of a school until it is being conducted. The effect of that is that there may be a short period during which a school is being conducted illegally whilst awaiting registration. The effect of clause 10 would be to amend section 98 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 by inserting after subsection (2) a new subsection (2A), to provide that it will not be an offence to conduct an unregistered independent school during the first month in which it is conducted, provided that an application for registration is made within that period. That is the purpose of the clause. We are trying to make as short as possible the period between the setting up of a school on a provisional basis and the requirement of its registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen will realise the difficulties in this situation. It is anomalous. There is a similar provision in the English Education Act of last year. I mention that because the matter has crept up under the English legislation and we have also had to consider it. We believe that this is the best way to have the tightest possible requirement and the strictest possible control over the launching of new independent private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have nothing against the principle of new private schools starting up. I hope that people will be encouraged to go into private education if that is what they wish. Judging by the complaints from Opposition Members during our debate on assisted places, there are not enough schools in Scotland able to offer places to hon. Gentlemen's constituents. They should welcome the spirit of the provision to enable more independent schools to be set up. However, the clause deals with the very important point of registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister admit that, by means of clause 10, he is relaxing the existing legislation? How can he therefore argue that the clause is the strictest possible control over the system of registration? Where has the clause come from? Has it just been transported from the English legislation, or has it come through representations from all those who are desperately keen to start up their own private schools? Who has been complaining and suggesting the terms of the clause? Let the Minister come clean on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to come clean about. I wish that the hon. Gentleman could use the word "English" without venom in his voice. I do not know whether he knows that he is doing it. He has to say the word in a way that suggests that he might not like our English colleagues. I am sure that he does not mean to be offensive to the other 500-odd Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is necessary to rectify an existing minor anomaly in the legislation governing the registration of independent schools. The 1980 Act makes it an offence to conduct an independent school which is not registered. However, it may be impracticable to register a school until it has been conducted at least for a few weeks—in this case, the period is one month. We are saying that it is not illegal to conduct an unregistered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>705</span>
school for one month. It is illegal at present, but this provision will mean that it is not illegal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that it is considered that, to inspect it and to measure its worthiness as an independent school, it should be in operation. We are saying that the school can be legally operated without being registered for one month, during which time it will be inspected. A school of any significance is not inspected in only a few hours. An inspector may require several days to satisfy himself about the worth, value and quality of that school. While the school is sitting the test, so to speak, it will not be illegal for it to be driving. That is the provision that we are making. One must drive the vehicle before the examiner can judge whether one is a competent driver. In the case of a school of this kind, one must operate the school before HMI will be able to judge whether one is capable of conducting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the clause seeks to do. There is nothing to come clean about, nothing is being hidden—quite the opposite. We are being completely open and frank with the Committee in saying "Here is an anomaly. How does one test a school unless it is in operation? Under the existing legislation, it is illegal to operate without a licence. Let them operate; we shall test them in operation. Then we shall decide whether they should get a licence."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister is coming clean on this, perhaps he can help us. Does the clause not relate principally to independent schools which are offering special education, rather than the sort that we have been discussing under the assisted-places scheme? Have any independent schools of the private sort discussed earlier, which were set up in Scotland in recent years, been considered? Does this not really apply to the kind of school that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) referred to with regard to the man who came from England, set up in Fife and is now planning to set up in Maybole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would apply in that case, but it is not specifically directed against any particular case, as I have now explained three or four times and therefore adequately to the Committee, my reply to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire is that it would include a special school. I know the particular case that he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has used the interesting parallel of a driving licence. One would not be able to get a provisional driving licence if one had been previously disqualified from driving. I wonder whether the Minister would care to apply that part of the analogy to the school situation and consider a case where someone has been shown to be running a school inefficiently and improperly, has had his registration withdrawn, yet starts to set up another school in a similar manner in another part of the country, or of the United Kingdom. Is there any provision for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>706</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would affect the application for a provisional licence in the first place. The Registrar would know whether someone applying to open a school had a record of the sort suggested by the hon. Gentleman. That could effect—I cannot be firm about it, as it must always depend on circumstances—the application for a provisional licence. If I am wrong, I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman on that point on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
understand the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) in respect of the amendment. I know that he has listened carefully to the explanations that I have given to the Committee. I am sure that he appreciates the practical difficulty that we must try to overcome. I am sure that he will appreciate that we are being as strict as we can in the interpretation, while at the same time making a practical decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must respond to that reply, which seemed to me to be very flimsy indeed. I fully understood what the Minister was saying but it did not make any sense in terms of the provision. The hon. Gentleman used the example of a driving licence, using it as a comparison. But if I apply for a provisional driving licence I must fill in a form to start with. On that form I have to state that I have no physical disabilities, that my eyesight is not defective, that I can read a number plate at a certain distance, that I am a certain age, and so on. Secondly when I then get into a car to drive it, I must get into one that is mechanically sound and has all the appropriate aids, and so on. In fact, it is an offence to get into a car at all until one is a full driver. Thirdly, I must have someone sitting beside me who is a qualified driver. If I commit an Offence or create damage, that person is just as liable as I am. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's analogy does not stand up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a better analogy would be a motor cyclist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only the third point I made for which citing a motor cyclist is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that a school cannot be inspected properly until it is operating. I entirely agree. But there are certain actions that can be taken before a full inspection is carried out, before the school is set up. First, the person who applies as a proprietor should surely undergo an examination of his educational background, of his capital assets to make sure that he can actually carry out what he has said he will carry out, and to make sure that he has no previous record of setting up a school and folding. That would be a perfectly legitimate course to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, he must be able to say what premises he has, and whether they are decent or not. And we should be entitled to look at the premises. If he says that he intends to have 50 children, we should be able to inspect the premises to decide whether they are large enough, and if they are not, we need to know what plans the proprietor has and whether he has planning permission for extra buildings. We want to know how many and what type of teachers he means to employ, what their qualifications are, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that should be done before the school is set up. That is the provisional part. Once that is done, he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>707</span>
receives a provisional licence, so to $peak, to start the school. After a month or two of operation—I would give a little more flexibility than the Minister—the inspectors come in to inspect the school as a working operation. At that point they can decide whether or not he will receive full registration, whether his provisional registration is allowed to continue as provisional, or lapses completely and the right is taken away. That surely is the way to protect the public. It does not appear to me to be an unfair way, and it gets round all the difficulties suggested by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned because I feel that we are getting into areas we ought not to. Planning permission must be applied for in any event if a building is to be used for this application. Before a number of people may be put into a building today, certain fire regulations and planning regulations have to be met. All this is not relevant to our debate. All this has to be done in much the same way as a motor-cycle has to be roadworthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In nine cases out of 10, even in 99 cases out of 100, the hon. Member would be correct. But if Fettes College closed down and a new proprietor came in and said "I want to set up a school in the building", I doubt whether he would need to obtain planning permission-—he would not be changing the use of the existing building. I accept that in many cases what the hon. Member said is true, but in some cases that would probably not be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small private infants' schools and other schools of that nature change hands. New proprietors buy them, take them over, and there is no change of use, so therefore there is no need to have planning permission and so on. The point made by the hon. Member is correct in some cases, but not in all. The Minister said that he was worried about this happening and wished that there were another way to do it. I have given him another way and I hope that he will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I found the Minister's reply totally unsatisfactory. I am still suspicious as to the origins of the clause. Has dissatisfaction been expressed by some of the private entrepreneurs who are in the process of starting private schools or who have recently tried to do so and found the existing legislation a disincentive? Did someone in the Scottish Education Department prompt the clause, or was it a free enterprise phoney educator in Edinburgh, perhaps a pal of the Minister's, who wanted to start his own school and get his hands on some public money through the assisted-places scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was an anomaly in the existing legislation. He claimed that a school could not be inspected until it was functioning. He later qualified that statement by saying that a school could not be fully inspected until it was functioning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart said, it might be inspected in certain ways, such as the premises and facilities within the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it a simple question of planning permission. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said, quite rightly, that if there were a change of use of the building planning permission might have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>708</span>
to be applied for. But the standards of acceptability of premises for educating children are, or ought to be, far higher than the basic requirements of the planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no case now is the planning authority the education authority. In the previous local government set-up, there were planning authorities that were also education authorities, but local planning now is a district council function, whereas education—with the exception of the islands authorities, which are multi-purpose —is a regional council function, Thus, in most cases, in Scotland, the planning authority is different from the education authority, so the opportunities for coordination between the planning authority and the education authority in decisions on whether premises are of an acceptable standard for education are limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might also take steps, before the school is actually functioning, to find out something about the qualifications and expertise, first of the person who has applied for registration and, secondly of prospective staff. There have been notable cases, including cases in Scotland, where one wonders how on earth some schools managed to gain registration in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long ago, I was in a fairly large private house in Edinburgh and I was told that, not long before, that house used to be a school. I expressed amazement and asked to go round and do an inspection. I asked where the classrooms, the laboratories, the home economics room and the typing class had been, and so on. I was told that there had been none of those facilities. There was one big room which was used as a multi-purpose general classroom. Into that room were herded I do not know how many children. There did not even seem to be a proper fire excape. Yet the school had operated for many years, presumably with the approval of Her Majesty's Inspectorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can take the hon. Member to visit the school if he is interested. It is in Edinburgh, Central which is not his constituency. Hon. Members are laughing, but we are talking about children's education, which is not a laughing matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member drew an analogy between issuing a licence to allow someone to run a school and issuing a licence to allow someone to drive a car. A child is far more important than a car. I know that a car can do lethal damage in the hands of the wrong person, but even in a month a teacher or a group of them in an unlicensed school can damage children in ways that are worse than lethal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman mean by damage that is "worse than lethal"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean damage that can be done to children's minds. Sometimes that can be worse than death and worse than much of the damage that can be caused by car accidents, Apart from that, when the provisional licence holder drives, he must have a qualified driver with him at all times, until the full licence is granted. A set of clowns with no qualifica-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>709</span>
tions at all can run a school, yet the Minister can approve it for up to one month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate part of the parent Act refers to the fact that it would not be merely a breach of regulations if someone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Worse than lethal"!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has never hard of the phrase "A fate worse than death" he must be thicker than even I thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate part of the parent Act makes it clear that if someone operates such a school even for a month, he is guilty of a breach of regulations as well as a criminal offence. Section 98(2) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20".</p></blockquote>
That is not very much, considering the damage that can be done to children—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding £50 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment."</p></blockquote>
We are now talking about a serious matter which can sometimes lead to imprisonment for up to three months. I believe that that period should be increased in some instances because the damage can be far-reaching and can affect children for the rest of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I suggest that the Minister strengthens the penalties for these offences by amending the 1980 Act rather than by means of clause 10. Furthermore, I suggest that he puts in a penalty to the effect that if such a school is found to be operating illegally even for one month with the Secretary of State's quasi-approval, and that harm has been done to children, the Minister himself should also be sent to gaol for at least 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who was far-reaching in his contribution to the debate, that we are talking about the Registrar of Independent Schools, whose purpose—believe it or not—is to register the school. We are not talking about planning and local authorities and the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has still missed the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the point had been made, we might have grasped it. The only point made was to consider responsibilities outside those of the Registrar of Independent Schools. No independent school would be registered if the proprietor was disqualified from being the proprietor of such a school. That would include, as I was suggesting earlier to the hon. Member of South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), for example, a disqualified teacher or someone of that ilk who was disqualified from teaching or carrying out any purpose related thereto. In the case of a criminal record, the existing legislation empowers the Secretary of State, if he is satisfied that the proprietor of a school is not a proper person, to serve a notice of complaint under section 99
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>710</span>
of the 1980 Act. After that the independent schools tribunal goes through the various steps necessary under the terms of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this clause we are concerned about an important but simple and straightforward matter, legalising the operation of a school so that it can be inspected and minimising—and, we think, to the absolute minimum— the period of that operation so that the proper inspection can be carried out before registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may have been said earlier, but under section 98 of the Act the Secretary of State appoints one of his officers to act as registrar.

It must be evident to the Committee that the Government are being more than helpful in this matter by bringing the Registrar here so that he can. by listening to the debate, and, indeed, making suggestions so that I may reply fully to it, give the Committee every confidence, not just in the function but in the person himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To understand the amendment we have to look at the parent Act, as we do with the clause itself. Schedule to the 1980 Act concerns the Independent Schools Tribunal, a tribunal established to look at complaints made against independent schools. They may be complaints of a major nature—for instance, that the building is not suitable or that a teacher in the school is not a fit person to be teaching there. Under the clause the Secretary of State for Scotland is amending the present form of the Independent Schools Tribunal. He is suggesting that it be called an independent schools tribunal instead of an educational panel and he is making one or two changes to the later part of paragraph 4 of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of amendment No. 229 is simply that those appointed to an independent schools tribunal should be both knowledgeable in education and accountable to the public at large. I do not wish to go through yet again the debate that we had about an hour ago on the question of local authorities being represented on the boards of governors of independent schools. But the points made during that debate are as valid, if not more valid, in regard to the body that will take decisions about complaints made against independent schools. Many of these schools will have been spending public money or receiving tax handouts in one form or another, and therefore people who are elected and who are accountable to the public at large ought to be judging whether the complaint is valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, not every elected member of every local education authority in Scotland is a member of the Labour Party. Many are members of other parties and some—the Secretary of State will make the appointments—will come from the Conservative Party. But they must be people nominated from elected members, because they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 230 and 223 to some extent do the same job. Paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the 1980 Act provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where any complaint is required to be determined by an Independent Schools Tribunal, the tribunal shall consist of the sheriff principal (or, if he is unable to act, a person qualified for appointment as sheriff principal nominated by the Lord President of the Court of Session)".</p></blockquote>
You may think, Mr. Hunt, that the fact that I am taking the sheriff principal out follows from the previous amendment. In one sense that is true. I saw it as a consequential amendment that I would take out the sheriff principal, because he probably would not be an elected member of a council. But it also stands as a valid amendment in its own right, which ought to be one that the Minister will accept. Paragraphs 2 of schedule 2 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No officer of any government department and no person employed by an education authority in any capacity other than that of a teacher shall be qualified to be appointed … and no person shall be so qualified unless he has had such experience in teaching or in the conduct, management or administration of schools as the Secretary of State considers suitable."</p></blockquote>
What sheriff principal qualifies under that paragraph?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>712</span>
How many sheriffs principal qualify who have had
	<br><blockquote><p>"experience of teaching or in the conduct, management or administration of schools"?</p></blockquote>
I think that very few of them would have had much experience in those terms and would therefore be suitable to be appointed by the Secretary of State to the independent schools tribunal, and yet the Secretary of State insists that the tribunal must be chaired by a sheriff principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under my amendment there would be no sheriff principal; there would be just three elected members. If that amendment is not accepted, I hope that the Minister will accept the second one under which there would be an independent tribunal of three members and presumably the Secretary of State would nominate one of them to be the chairman. The chairman does not, in my view, have to be a sheriff principal. The judgments to be made are not of a legal nature. I hope that we shall be able to get away from the idea that only lawyers can chair such bodies. Other people have as much expertise and experience in education as sheriffs and lawyers, or more, it is such people, rather than the sheriff principal, who should serve on the tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under subsection (c) in the parent Act
	<br><blockquote><p>"the words from 'of whom' to the end of the paragraph shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
The words to be deleted are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of whom at least one shall be a woman in the case of a complaint concerning a school for girls or a complaint concerning the proprietor of a school, or a teacher therein, who is a woman."</p></blockquote>
There is a somewhat simplistic school of thought on women's rights according to which women should be treated in exactly the same way as men and therefore any special reference to women should be deleted. I question that view. I think that there is sometimes a case for positive discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many circumstances in which the sexes are not yet equal in any meaningful way, and in which the Equal Opportunities Commission has as yet failed to achieve some measure of equality. I should be interested to know the rationale behind the Minister's desire to delete those words and why he does not want to retain the services of a statutory woman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell the Committee who currently constitute the education panel nominated by the Secretary of State?

education panel before the next stage of the consideration of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will see what I can do. That was not a difficult question, but it was just that I did not know the answer. There is a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with amendment No. 229. Contrary to the hon. Gentleman, I think that the prime requirement of any member of a tribunal should continue to be that he has experience in teaching and in the conduct, management and administration of schools rather than the case under consideration. Obviously such matters are taken into account when appointing a tribunal. Otherwise there would be little point in investigating cases, some of which can be extremely tricky to resolve, as I know from my little experience over the past few years. I think that it makes sense to retain the position whereby we are using people experienced in some aspect of education to consider cases of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) also referred to amendment No. 223. The reason for this is that it is not difficult to envisage cases in which it would be appropriate to appoint women members to the tribunal. Equally, it is possible that the nature of a complaint concerning a girls' school would have no particular feminine aspect. The only complaint considered by a tribunal since arrangements were introduced in 1957 concerned a school owned by a woman, but that was not significant as the case concerned fire escape facilities. It was important, when examining that case, that experience of that aspect should be considered rather than the sex of those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was critical of the expertise that lawyers can bring to a tribunal of this kind. We think that the sheriff principal should be the chairman of the tribunal and should bring to it his expertise in weighing the evidence presented in any case and assessing its credibility. Members of the legal profession—particularly sheriffs principal—are used to weighing up evidence and to dealing with a variety of cases in the course of their careers. The parties against whom a complaint is made would probably feel happier if they believed that the decision, which is a kind of judgment, were being considered by someone with experience of making such decisions. I cannot recommend the amendment to my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to sheriffs attending the independent schools tribunal, has the Minister taken account of the fact that about half of the sheriffs went to private or grant aided schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is terribly sensitive when his educational background is mentioned and me says in defence, "It is not where my parents sent me to school, but where I send my children to school that really counts". In view of his sensitivity to the fact that he was educated in a private school, he should keep quiet on the social as well as the educational background. I imagine, knowing a little of the school he attended, that social background was a consideration in getting him into the school. Let us face it, it could not have been academic achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>714</span>
However, I am able to answer the hon. Gentleman's question about the members of the independent schools tribunal education panel this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current membership of the educational panel is Sister Felicitas of Our Lady and St Francis RC secondary school, Glasgow; Mr. J. M. Hamilton, MA, of Harris Academy, Dundee; Mr. R. M. Watt, MA, Bannerman High School, Baillieston. Those are all head teachers of local authority schools. The person with experience of grant-aided secondary schools is Professor A. G. Beattie, FRSE, of Edinburgh university, a former chairman of Morrison's Academy and a governor of Sedbergh. Head teachers of independent schools are represented by Mr. W. D. Latham of Blairmore school, Huntly and Miss M. E. Bennett, MA, the ex-headmistress of Lansdowne House school, Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points about that last category. My daughter went to Lansdowne House and we could also have included among representatives of independent schools the hon. Member for Cathcart who has had experience of such matters as a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the governors of independent schools there is Professor J. C. Gunn of Glasgow university, a governor of Glasgow Academy—again appropriate to hon. Gentlemen—-and Dr. A. A. Ritchie, former convener of the board of governors of Cranley school, Edinburgh. Mrs. A. S. Eason of Harmeny school committee is a person with experience in special education, and other educational interests are represented by Miss Ethel Rennie, ex-principal of the Craigie college of education—which is still is in existence—and Dr. Joan Taylor, assistant principal of the Aberdeen college of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much more helpful, I ask hon. Members, can we be in the Committee this evening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that that list probably has not been altered in the last three, four or five years. Certainly Miss Ethel Rennie, when she retired as principal of Craigie college, took her married name of Mrs. Ethel Gray and is therefore incorrectly listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I return to the amendments and make one point about the sheriff principal whom the Minister mentioned? As the paragraph in the schedule was originally worded, what the Minister said might have been right. What that paragraph did was to establish an educational panel, and when it came to establishing a tribunal the Secretary of State first selected the sheriff principal and then selected two people from the panel to serve with him. But the Bill now takes out the educational panel and institutes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an Independent Schools Tribunal by the Secretary of State under paragraph 4 below".</p></blockquote>
However, the Bill has not taken out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"no person shall be so qualified unless he has had such experience in teaching".</p></blockquote>
The Independent Schools Tribunal is now not chosen from an educational panel. It is established and every person on it must be a person of educational experience in the way that the Minister suggested. The sheriff principal—in nine cases out of 10—cannot serve because he is not a member of the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that these are amendments which my hon. Friends will wish to push too hard at

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is concerned with the obligation on social work departments to make educational provision. We feel that in this clause it would be preferable to have an obligation imposed upon local authorities. It is not sufficient for them to have a power, they should have a duty to provide educational content in social work establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that there should be some sort of backing for the nursery provision in social work departments. We think that the Government are less than strongly committed to the concept of nursery education and that in their desire to cut public expenditure and abdicate their responsibilities to local authorities, they turn their backs on the standards that we feel should be required of a Government. One of those standards is the imposition of an obligation upon local authorities to improve the quality of nursery education, which is what we seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already had discussions about whether the Government are prepared to put their money where their mouth is. We recognise that they are not. When they are not making unreasonable requirements of local authorities in respect of powers, they choose to starve them of resources. We think that it is important to place obligations upon local authorities so that they will start to make it clear that it is the Government's fault that these undertakings are being reneged upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the Report stage of the English Bill and the provision to withdraw the requirement upon local authorities to provide nursery education. In preparation for a speech that I was not called upon to make, I asked the Library to obtain references to nursery education from old 	<i>Hansards</i> in the name of the then right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), then Secretary of State for Education in the previous Conservative Administration. It was clear that the prevailing education fashion at that time was to back nursery education, but in these days of dark monetarism, when even the wettest of the wets becomes dried out, it is clear that there is no commitment to nursery education. If these amendments could be passed, we should begin to turn the tide and take the first steps towards a U-turn for the Government in their obligations to the ideal of nursery education being as broadly available as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>716</span>
We are starting in a tairly modest area—the provision of nursery education under the terms of the Social Work (Scotland) Act. We hope that that modest start will encourage the Government to consider the educational needs of under-fives, and to take on board the fact that education does not simply start at school, but cannot take place only in the home. There must be opportunities before a child reaches the age of five. In the main we are talking about under-privileged children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will consider the amendments in the constructive light in which they have been presented. We hope that he will accept them and make it clear that if he is not prepared to look after children at school and those with special educational needs, he may be prepared to insist that local authorities meet what are certainly their moral obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the children concerned are at establishments provided under the Social Work (Scotland) Act and are disadvantaged because of economic and social deprivation. I hope that the Minister will try to firm up local authorities' resolve along the lines that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Having got the wrong list, I was a little confused and was taken by surprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt my colleagues will discuss the other amendments, but I shall speak particularly to amendments Nos. 228 and 227. These amendments deal with the composition of the SCE examination board and the officials have carefully and helpfully made that information available to us. No doubt the Minister will be delighted to know that I have had an opportunity of studying it in some detail. Therefore, he will not be able to wave it about and say "The answer is in here." On another occasion, it was not—but that is another story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and hon. Members have the opportunity of examining the board's composition in page 4 of the 1979 report, they will see that it is yet another of the many bodies on which I served at one time or another. I am beginning to be a little like the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) in relating my experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, amendment No. 288—which concerns the representatives from universities—arose from that. We have suggested that the number of representatives from the universities should be limited. That is in no way to diminish the contribution that they make to the examination board. I know that many university professors who are members of the examination board, have contributed a great deal over a long time. I should not want anything that I have said to be taken as a slight on these individual members and their contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding that, it has been my experience, and that of many other members on the examination board, that because of the composition of the board, and because of the prominent role its members play, the number of representatives from the universities means that they dominate and that the interests of the universities dominate most of the thinking of the examination board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 3 of the report, we see that the chairman and 37 other members are appointed by the Secretary of State. Of these 38 members, eight are nominated by the universities. The teacher associations, which have 12 representatives—and I am sure the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) agrees with me—have a preeminent responsibility and interest in what is happening. The universities have the highest number of representatives, far and away above the others—for example those from the central institutions. I should have thought that the colleges of education would have a strong interest, and the directors of education, who have an even greater interest than the Convention of Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>718</span>
Local Authorities which represents the local authorities themselves. These bodies, as I said in an earlier debate, have a statutory responsibility for education in the majority of our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience is that not only is there an arithmetical preponderance of university representatives but that they play a large part in the discussions. I do not blame them for that, but, because of their numerical preponderance, they are able to do this. The examinations committee, particularly, has for some time been convened by a university professor. My view is that that has resulted in the false structure and development of examinations in Scotland. The examination board does not only administer the examinations. It gives the whole ethos and framework in which the examinations develop and in which the thinking in respect of examinations develops in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few decades, this matter has been dominated by the needs of universities and, by the preparation of students to enter Scottish universities. I submit that, since only a small percentage of school pupils ultimately attend university, it is not necessarily right that the needs of universities should dominate and influence the examinations system, which should be designed for the majority of students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, of 38 representatives, the universities have eight. If they had an eighth, they would have about five. So this proposal is not slashing the representation to any great extent. It is trying to cut down the representation in almost a token way, and by doing so to express our concern at the way in which the needs of universities—these small academic needs within our schools—are dominating the examination system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examination system, of course, has a great influence on the curriculum. By the universities dominating the examination system, they are also dominating the curriculum, which means that the design of the curriculum is principally to take account of the needs of this small percentage in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire is nodding. I hope that people like himself, with practical experience and not filled with the university ethos—and the Minister, too—will understand the needs of pupils who often cannot or do not want to go on to university. The curriculum and examination system is not relevant to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of amendment No. 227 is aimed at endearing to the Minister my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and myself, who have become betes noires of the Minister, by taking up his clarion call for parental involvement, choice and participation. We are asking why, when there is an influential body such as the examination board, are there no parents—qua parents—on it? Certainly, there are professors and councillors, and others who are parents of children at local authority schools. But no one is on the board specifically to represent parents' interests. Those from a local authority are there to represent its interests and to take special note of the accounts for which they have to provide the money, as well as other matters. The professors are there to represent the interests of the universities—and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be sensible to insert an amendment saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>719</span>
that parents, as such, should be represented. Someone from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council or the Association of School Councils could be chosen—I am not volunteering—for the examination board and could consider matters from the parents' point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the pupils must be taken into account. Some people believe that it is a radical and outrageous suggestion for pupil representatives to sit on the board. I accept that student representation in universities, because of the transient population, has limited value, and so will pupil representation on the examination board. But that is no greater than the limitations of some other representation—including my own, which was also relatively transient. I envisage that there will be senior pupils, who are the consumers in the system. They know what is going on in schools from the point of view of the person for whom the system is designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pupils must be considered as well as parents, who obviously have an interest in the education service. It is sensible, and should be possible, for parents and pupils to be represented on the examination board. I hope that the Minister will take account of my suggestions, none of which is party-political in any way. None represents a major division of doctrine or dogma between the two sides of the Committee. They are genuine proposals for reform and improvement in the composition of the SCE examination board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I might be able to speak before midnight; it has been a long wait. The speech that we have just heard has not been an improvement on any of the others from the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He suggested that senior pupils might sit on the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have news for the hon. Gentleman about the real world. Senior pupils are far too busy preparing for the examinations set by the board to be bothered about that, or to waste their time in going to its meetings as transient members. Perhaps one of the troubles with the hon. Member for South Ayrshire is that he has been a transient member of far too many bodies. With any luck he is a transient Member of this House, too. It is a piece of nonsense to suggest that pupils should sit on the examination board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other and perhaps more dangerous amendment is that relating to universities. The hon. Gentelman said that a reduction from eight to five university members of the board would be insignificant. I should have thought that a reduction of three was fairly significant. The hon. Gentleman suggested that perhaps the universities should not have the dominant place, but in my view the most important feature of Scottish education, the reason for its position in the forefront of education for many years, is the pre-eminent position of the Scottish universities. Perhaps one of the reasons why that position is no longer so pre-eminent is the influence of people such as the hon. Member for South Ayrshire in Scottish education. The role of the universities in maintaining standards and other such functions is vital. I should be extremely reluctant to see any diminution of the impact of the universities on the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire that many more institutions than universities would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>720</span>
concerned about standards if they could see this House reducing the impact of the universities. Not only universities but colleges and industries would be concerned that the main reason for removing university members from the board was an attempt to drop the standards of the examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I have heard the Opposition argument I am even more bothered that, in order to allow the people to whom my two amendments relate on to the examination board, my hon. Friend may reduce university or teacher representation, or some other element of the present representation. If members are to come on to the board to represent other institutions, unless the number of members is to be increased that must mean that some members will have to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 suggests that the right of institutions of further education to be represented on the board should be deleted that right is not necessary. At present the local education authority or the teachers can nominate FE members as part of their packages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 161 suggests the deletion of the proposed new paragraph (c). If anything could be designed to put me off the idea of introducing new members to SCEEB it would be that paragraph. I guarantee that if university people were replaced by educational advisers, a decline in standards would follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to that parade of prejudices from the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). He sounds like the crusty old chalk-sodden character who sits on the staffroom armchair behind a copy of 	<i>The Scotsman</i>—in Argyll or Oban it may be the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman justify his loathing and contempt for advisers? I have met some who merit those sentiments, but I have met principal teachers of mathematics who merit them, too. I do not know enough about the hon. Gentleman's professional standing to comment about that side of his character. However, I should be interested to know what evidence he has to support his opinions. Will he give us examples of advisers who merit his contempt, or is he simply parading the prejudices of some of the darker areas of the profession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to answer that question in great detail. By and large, although some advisers are useful, others simply attempt to peddle and enforce the political decisions about education taken by their employing authorities. Others still attempt to propagate their own views regardless of the extent to which those conflict with the views of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although advisers have some limited value—I accept that that is so—they have nothing like the value that would merit a special place on the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board. I suggest to my hon. Friend that if an adviser is suited in the opinion of the directorate to sit on the examination board, the directorate can appoint him to the examination board as one of its people, and that it should not have a place on its own. I urge my hon. Friend to look at my two amendments and to answer my question—if some of those other people are put on to the board, does that imply that others will be removed and is there any danger that those who are removed may be the uni-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) does not speak often, but every time I listen to him I am convinced that when he loses his seat at the next General Election, he will have a job for the rest of his life standing in a museum of education representing the educational concepts of the nineteenth century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, equally, is typical rural school staffroom rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that what our schools and our education system are about, in these days, is training 10 per cent, of our population to go to universities will not do. It is a misconception of what is required of our education system in the modern age. If the hon. Member for Argyll was not saying that, he was implying it when he talked about standards and so on. Those have to be imposed by the universities. What is required—I do not wish to go into a long lecture—in our economy and our society today from our education system is a broadening of the system so that more people have some form of qualification and get some sort of training, a training appropriate for the life and job that they will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the board is not necessarily dominated by, but having a strong influence from, the universities, it will be the universities that tend to dominate it. I wish, therefore, to support my hon. Friend in saying that we should reduce the representation from the universities. They will still have a pretty powerful voice on the board, but it should not be as dominating a voice as it is at present. One has only to talk to university people to know that the universities see the schools purely as a sifting process whereby they can get the right people through into the universities. They are interested not in the 90 per cent, who will not come to them, but only in the 10 per cent, who will come to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that is not true of all university people, but it is an attitude that one comes across time and again when one talks to such people. That is the attitude which, if we are to build up a modern technological society, we must get rid of. One way—a small and not very significant way—of doing that is to try to reduce the influence of universities on bodies such as the examination board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never realised that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was on the board. It means that, for a brief point of his life and for a brief point of my life, he was my employer. He may not be aware of that, but he was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Parents are people who have a major concern about the examination system. So have the pupils, and they should be represented. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Again, the Minister is muttering from a sedentary position—half of which he wants us to hear and the other half he does not. He is very good at doing that. Throughout our discussions we have heard a great deal about parents' rights, but when we try to suggest that parents should sit on a board which could have an important impact on the future careers of their children, the Minister starts to mutter, so I assume that he is about to oppose the amendment because he does not wish to see parents represented on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cannot get any intelligence from the Minister we might, at least, get the consistency of stupidity. If he were consistent, he would accept the amendment, because he keeps talking about parents' rights and freedom of choice. When we offer the opportunity of ensuring that parents should be represented on this most important board, which controls so much of what their children will do in life, the Minister mutters. When I say that he will oppose the amendment, he makes it clear that he will. I am not surprised that he has disappeared to sit on the window sill. It is an appropriate place for him. With a bit of luck the window will open and he will fall out backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll. Once again, his little prejudices are showing. What has he got against institutions of further education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joh MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman says "nothing", why should not those institutions, along with schools and education authorities, be represented on the examination board? Further education institutions are increasingly the means by which people who did not pass examinations at school have the opportunity to expand their education and acquire qualifications later in life. I have dealt with many mature women in the teaching profession who sat for their O-levels and highers at the age of 45 or even up to the age of 50. Those teachers had attended further education colleges to attain those basic O-levels and higher qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If further education institutions are providing that sort of education for the more mature person, they should be represented on the board. While I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment, he should

reject that tabled by his hon. Friend. The hon. Member for Argyll is just showing his prejudices; he dislikes anything in education which does not involve standing in front of a class. It is a very worthwhile job, and no one would deny that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He thinks that such people are supernumerary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman would agree with me if I tabled a new clause to abolish headmasters from all schools and have the schools run by committees. The fact is that he keeps showing these prejudices. Even if his hon. Friend accepts his amendments, 1 shall oppose them, but I am sure that his hon. Friend will not accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about time the non-academics on the Committee made some points. I support the attitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) on the question of colleges of further education because I believe that the City and Guilds of London Institute takes good care of the needs of many who go to colleges of further education and prepares them to meet the real world about which, as I understood it, the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be concerned about preparing children for the real world. I believe that the examinations set and influenced by the universities of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member is aware that many of the City and Guilds courses require an O-level for entrance. Some, though not all, require at least two or three O-levels. 1 do not want to quote committees on which 1 have served but I happen to know that. The fact is that many students have to get O-levels in the college of education before they can start the City and Guilds courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always interesting to listen to the hon. Gentleman. I was on the advisory committee of the City and Guilds of London Institute. I should add that I have been a member of an examinations board, so the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is not the only one. Mine was the Royal Air Force examinations board, where the standards were very important. If one did not meet them, one was usually given a military funeral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there arc targets to aim at, unless there are objectives to be achieved, unless we are pushing and stretching the best people, those who are not so good will not find themselves pulled towards the top. I have listened throughout my life to educationists who have made the most awful mess of our education system—so much so that few parents have kind words to say about it. 1 believe that it is probably the result of individuals in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>724</span>
teacher training colleges who attempt to teach but rarely ever fly themselves—which is probably the best example that I can give. One could never have been a member of the Royal Air Force examinations board without currently being involved in flying. There is no way one can do the job without being in current flying practice, and similarly educationists in teacher training colleges need to be regularly sent back to the class to show that they can teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are determined to approach this problem in a sensible and logical way, perhaps we should recognise that few members of examination boards are likely to be celibate and that at some time or other they were parents, if not when on the board, so I estimate that they are sitting on boards as parents anyway, and that should be remembered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll are presented in a logical and sensible way, and I find them interesting. The amendments tabled by the Opposition have once again convinced me that they live in an airy-fairy world of academics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that almost half the members on this side of the Committee were at one time or another in the employment of this examinations board. My memory of employment conditions as a young teacher is of sweated labour which one undertook to get a bit of extra pocket money to take one's wife and kids on a half-decent holiday. I would not even give the Minister an "E" in an O-grade. In fact, the two Ministers together would not get an "E" between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When marking papers, I used to wonder about the influence of the board and whether representation on it was as wide as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) referred to university representation on the board. The influence of the universities on the construction of papers in the various subjects results in inevitable distortion of the curriculum. Tremendous pressures are put on teachers regarding presentation for examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never believed that examinations and passing them are the be-all and end-all of an educational system, but they are important. Due regard must be paid to academic progress and the measurement of academic attainment within a school. But it is not simply to cater for future university entrants. That is not the ideal way of considering the examination system or whatever system of assessment we may perhaps want to replace it with at some future stage. Even the Minister is paying lip service to the Munn and Dunning reports which will bring about a changed form of assessment in one part of the school and may also have repercussions in later years on the work of the examinations board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long ago, a survey was carried out among first-year students at the university of St. Andrews. St. Andrews may not be a typical Scottish university, but the survey showed some worrying evidence that students from Scottish schools tended to do less well in the first year than students from schools south of the border. It seems that part of the reason may have been that the courses in the university of St. Andrews were more geared to applicants with English qualifications—namely, GCE A-levels—than to Scottish students with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>725</span>
higher grade passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministers will be aware of the differences. Although the standard of a GCE A-level in some subjects may be a little higher than the standard of a higher grade pass in SCE examinations, nevertheless there are differences between the Scottish and English systems. For example, the Scottish student tends to go to university with perhaps four, five or six passes at higher grade, whereas in England the equivalent may be two or three A-levels, because of the earlier specialisation which takes place in English schools. I think that in Scotland we have rightly placed greater emphasis on breadth of curriculum and on the resultant breadth of presentation in passes both at O-grade and higher grade in the Scottish certificate of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like that broad-based system to continue, but I am aware that the evidence from the university of St. Andrews seems to indicate that some people in universities prefer an earlier specialisation system in our schools, more like the English A-level system. I have heard that opinion expressed in informal discussions by people in universities. This influence may be creeping into the SCE examination board and may influence the school curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may agree that the St. Andrews evidence is not conclusive and that there are other factors, such as the tendency of English students to be older than the Scottish students when they enter. The evidence also suggests that if the problem exists, it is only in the first year and subsequently English and Scottish students do equally well at St. Andrews as at other universities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that it is entirely due to the difference in examination structures between Scotland and England, but it was strange that St. Andrews seemed to have that experience, which was more pronounced than any evidence 1 have seen from other Scottish universities. There is a high intake of students at St. Andrews from south of the border, and it may be that in the first-year courses it caters more for the student with GCE A-levels rather than the student with SCE highers. That point is worth bearing in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I should intervene to amplify the earlier points made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. The influence of the universities can often be seen in curricular innovation and in innovations on assessments within our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) will, like me, remember the introduction of the modern mathematics syllabus in schools. Again, some people in the universities who had never taught in schools in their lives were mainly influential not just in composing the courses for the new modern mathematics syllabus but in the method of assessment. 1 am in favour of the modern mathematics syllabus. It was a great improvement on what at that time was called the traditional mathematics syllabus. But the way in which it was presented to the schools for them to present to the pupils was far from perfect. The textbook used at that time was unfortunately looked upon by some teachers almost as a bible of mathematics. It was geared mainly for the top 20 per cent., or even less, of pupils in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>726</span>
The university influence was largely instrumental in the fact that many children had learning difficulties. Many of the older teachers, too, at that time who were used to the traditional syllabus which they had followed for 20 or 30 years or more had almost to relearn mathematics themselves. They had a great deal of difficulty and felt, with some justification, that somehow the new mathematics had been handed down from on high by people at universities who had never taught in a comprehensive school in their lives and were simply interested in pupils who would eventually be university entry calibre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to encourage as many pupils as possible to go on to higher education, whether it be university or college. But we should never lose sight of the fact that at present only a relatively small minority do so. It is about 10 per cent. 1 should like to see that percentage increased, but we must remember that there are many other aspects of education than simply preparation for university or other forms of higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is a preparation for life in all its aspects. The points that my hon. Friend made about broader and more balanced representation on the Scottish certificate of education examination board arc closely relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by referring to amendments Nos. 228 and 227 in the names of my hon. Friends. I have considerable sympathy with No. 228. On occasion, we can start to go overboard in our questioning of the elitist nature of universities and their undue influence on our system, but many of us who have taught in comprehensive schools feel that the curriculum is distorted by placing the emphasis on examinations and that the examinations themselves are often heavily influenced by the requirements of university entrance. Therefore, it would be a salutary experience for the examination boards if a formal limitation were placed on their influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in sympathy with amendment No. 228. I think that it is impractical to have pupils on an examination board and that the length of time that they would be on it would not be worth the experience. On any committee one tends to spend at least one year learning the ropes, and only by the second or third year can one make an adequate contribution. While 1 appreciate my hon. Friend's good intentions, I shall not support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not recall exactly the same argument being put to him when he was a student at Heriot-Watt university by the principal and court of that university against student representation on the governing body of the court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one argument in favour of student representation on the governing board of an academic institution; there is quite another argument for the students to be members of the examining body or to have a say in the running of examinations as this body would. 1 donot think that the position is analogous and that one can pray in aid the case of those who in many respects are mature adults whereas others, to a large extent, are simply mature adolescents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 do not think that there is a case for having students on the board. There is a considerable case for student

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>727</span>
or pupil involvement in the running of schools, but neither the pupil-representatives nor those whom they would represent would benefit greatly from their presence on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if my hon. Friend will not accept the amendment regarding pupils, perhaps we may suggest that we might table an amendment on Report which allowed representation not of those who were immediately concerned but of those who had been immediately concerned. In other words, perhaps there might be representation from the National Union of Students, the STUC youth committee or some organisation which at least represents those who have had immediate experience of sitting these examinations, so that they can contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what my hon. Friend is seeking in that respect. The argument does not appeal to me at all. I do not see why we have to change the terms of the argument to try to appease what may be prejudices. 1 do not see the case for pupils being involved in the examination boards. I imagine that these are ways in which legitimate grievances about the organisation of the examinations, the timetable or the dates can be channelled effectively. If it is a grievance about the content of examinations, perhaps hon. Gentlemen would justify on academic grounds the contributions which pupils could make; but so far they have not done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there are organisations such as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. That is a vehicle which could be used to seek nominations from parents. I have no deep-seated objection to parents being on it, as they probably have as much right as representatives of local government. I am not in any way being offensive to the services which my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) provided when he was on that committee, but we would have to look at the nominating bodies with parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council provided comments on this legislation, some of which were helpful and some of which were very much the product of parents who considered themselves fortunate enough to have "bright" children who need special treatment. In my estimation, one of the problems of parental representation is that in the main, though not always, they tend to be the parents of children who are doing quite well. The parents are articulate and forceful, and in my experience of school councils and parent-teacher associations we tend not to get the parents of the less able children because there is a sense of embarrassment. One could argue that in the context of an examination those parents would not be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, my hon. Friend is not suggesting that we should not encourage parent-teacher associations or school councils because of the undoubted difficulty of getting working-class parents involved. We should seek to overcome those difficulties and find opportunities to get them involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not make any reference to working-class parents. I simply said that my experience was that some of the parents who sought to represent other parents in the parent-teacher associations tended not to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>728</span>
be representative of all the parents of the children in the institutions. I was merely questioning that, and I believe that if my hon. Friend will read the 	<i>Official Report</i> when it becomes available he will find that I said that 1 was in favour in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I see that there are certain problems, and I have some misgivings about the representative character of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. The evidence which that body provided tended to support the view that it was a somewhat elitist organisation in terms of the educational philosophies which it sought to expound in respect of the legislation. 1 recognise that if there is to be parent representation, it would probably have to come from a body such as that and I sought merely to put in a qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am in favour of parents being involved where possible in this procedure. 1 realise that in a committee of 38 the representation would be token in nature anyway, but to a certain extent all representation on such committees is token. It is a matter of whether the representation is greater than the sum of its parts in terms of what it contributes to the general proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the somewhat predictable amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and 1 refer first to the one relating to the institutions of further education. A matter that has been ignored is that ever-increasing numbers of students are being presented by institutions of further education. 1 believe that it would be wrong to ignore that growing element in the examination system. As I never worked for the examination board and was never a marker, I did my stint of overtime in a technical college and was responsible for presenting students for higher examination over a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had not only the evening class element but an ever increasing number of students who were turning their backs on the school system. I can readily appreciate that the hon. Member for Argyll, with his somewhat restricted, although lengthy, experience of education, living in a small town which probably did not boast a technical college—though 1 may be wrong about that— would not appreciate that a further education centre can contribute to such an extent in respect of presentations for SCE exams. An ever increasing contribution is made by that sector, and it is only right that it should be represented. 1 believe that it is only fair that it should be given recognition of its contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that we see here some anticipation of differing forms of provision for the 16 to 19 age group. There could well be an ever greater expansion in further education, and it is perhaps appropriate that representatives from those bodies should be taken on board as quickly as possible.

To single out the educational advisers is easy, it is the sort of thing that will get cheap praise in the columns of the educational journals, and the voices of reactionary Neanderthals speak out once again. 1 am sure that all of us have experienced inadequate educational advisers. Equally, any of us who have had exposure to the education system on the staff side will know that if educational advisers are doing a good job they are invaluable to the system. One of their basic functions is to provide the most up-to-date information not only on course content but on the manner of its presentation, and it is appropriate that they should feed into the assessment system as well. There are organisations of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>729</span>
educational advisers, so it should not be difficult for the Minister to seek nominations from such a body in order to have those people on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the membership of this board on educational grounds and whether that membership will make a positive contribution to the quality of the board's work. As 1 said, in respect of university teachers over the years my inclination has been to say that they have had too dominant an influence and that they could do with a bit of limitation. In respect of parents and pupils, it is not unreasonable to assume that parents should be represented. There are bodies from which they can be chosen. As to the pupils, I think that the contribution they make would be limited and the difficulties in getting appropriate representatives, given the failure of pupil unions, for want of a better expression, to get off the ground, suggest that it would be impracticable to find them. I do not know whether they could be on the committees long enough to make the type of meaningful contribution which membership of such a body would require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should naturally wish to vote against the further education amendment. The provision in the Bill is a welcome step it must have been slipped in when the Minister was not looking and it suggests that somebody, somewhere, is of a progressive cast of mind. Equally, on the question of the educational advisers, I think one can say at this time in the morning, when perhaps hon. Members are a little less alert than at other times, that this is a worthwhile step and one which will be of considerable assistance to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the criticisms levelled at educational advisers is that they tend to be on the move a lot. But they tend to meet people in all sectors of the teaching profession and the education service. They are probably the individuals who get about and are exposed to a good deal more in the way of influences in respect of the examination system than are others. Directors of education tend to be desk-bound, the others tend to work within their own sectors, whereas the educational advisers get around both inside the education sphere as well as outside it. For my money, I think that they can make a useful contribution.

I support amendment No. 228,I oppose No. 227, and I oppose the amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Argyll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. People are always fascinated by the membership of various bodies and the decision as to which groups should be represented. It is understandable that members of the Committee wanted to exercise their views this evening. There has been a certain amount of agreement across the Committee on some issues raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) successfully challenged the view that the university representation should be reduced. It is not right that the university representation dominates the examination board. Teachers dominate the membership of the board, and that is not surprising. I do not complain about it. However, 1 agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend's point about the value and importance of the university sector in Scotland. Relationships between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>730</span>
industry and education often begin in universities. That is important with regard to the connection between education through university examinations and the preparation of young people for a working life. Therefore, I do not need to say anything else about amendment No. 228 because I totally disagree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised an interesting point about industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments arc fairly clear, and although you were good enough to allow the debate to develop, Mr. Hunt, I believe that it is now my duty to bring it together by replying to specific amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way, so the hon. Gentleman must remain in his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 227 is about parents and pupils on the board. My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) adequately answered the question about parents, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll. However, we must remember that members of the examination board have all been pupils. Many of them are parents, and the suggestion that parents should be put on the board is, as the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said, difficult. It is difficult to select people only in their capacity as parents. Representatives from universities, schools and local authorities who happen to be parents can become members of the board. But, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is difficult to choose people from society whose qualification for such a job is exclusively that of a parent. Those who volunteer may not always be the most appropriate for the task in question. The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire has adequately answered his hon. Friend's suggestion that pupils should be members of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll. He argued that the introduction of other sectors such as the advisory sector would take away the places of others. But the composition of the board is a matter for regulation, and, as he knows, we have issued a document about the examination board. Further consultation in the membership will take place through a supplementary letter which will be sent out to the appropriate bodies. Therefore, it is not for me to discuss the effect of the representations from various sources on the constitution of the board at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendment No. 160, 1 believe that it is important that the further education sector should be represented. Again, as the hon. Gentleman said, it does not just deal with children who come from our schools. This sector is educating an increasing number of children in general education subjects and putting them up for examinations. Therefore, it is right that the further education sector should be recognised in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know my hon. Friend's views on the question of educational advisers. He was right to raise the matter but advisers constitute a separate interest, and their professional contribution to the school curriculum and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>731</span>
to assessment matters has developed markedly since the board's inception. For that reason my view is that they are worthy of separate representation on the board. Therefore, I say to him that, as always, I listened with interest to his comments, but in this regard I believe that we should reconstitute the board in the way that we have. We are making significant changes to it in other ways also, but we must recognise those two particular sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 174, in page 37, line 3, leave out "presenting" and insert "presentation of".—	<i>[Mr. Alexander Fletcher.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 210, in page 37, line 13, leave out "and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 211 and 212.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 210 merely effects a grammatical change, so I shall not spend time on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention in amendment No. 211 is to ensure that the examination board seeks the approval of the Secretary of State before entering into any transaction intended to provide it with new premises or to extend the existing premises where additional accommodation is necessary for fulfilling the board's various functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment arises as a consequence of the Government's intention under subsection (8) to repeal the power to make specific grant to the board. Hitherto specific grant has been used principally to finance the board's accommodation needs. For example, it was used in giving a Government grant of approximately £500,000 towards the present premises at Dalkeith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead it is intended that the board will in future be permitted by regulations made under section 129(4) to undertake borrowing, leasing or other arrangements for providing accommodation for the board. The servicing of these transactions would become an annual charge on current expenditure. I have outlined these arrangements in the consultative paper which I have tabled today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 212 is to give COSLA express power to approve the remuneration and/or fees paid to employees. It will spell out explicitly that the board will have to seek the approval of the local authority body referred to in clause 13(4)(6), in effect the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, before
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>732</span>
the remuneration or fees payable to personnel employed by the board is determined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister briefly tell us why it would be grammatically wrong to have "and" in line 13?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be insulting the hon. Gentle-^ man's record as a teacher if I were to start teaching him grammar now. I know that he managed to become a maths teacher, but he should hold on while he is winning and not try to enter into the English side of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure exactly what the Minister's intention is in amendment No. 211. It seems to have the scabrous hand of the Secretary of State for Industry about it rather than that of the Secretary of State for Scotland. It seems to be an area in which the Government are seeking to limit the activities of public bodies. As I understand it, that is the other side of the procedures which will prevent the Secretary of State from making grants to the examination board, and consequently if the exam board requires money for expansion of its premises, it will have to raise it by borrowing or some other arrangement. The expense of the borrowing arrangement will apparently be a charge against the revenue side of the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to help me here. I have a copy of his regulations. The borrowing powers are dealt with in paragraphs 15 and 16. Can the Minister tell me if the effect of the amendment will be to increase the charges on the revenue side, thus requiring the examination board to increase the cost of sitting examinations as a result of introducing a different system of providing funds for building projects and the like?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have, as the hon. Gentleman will know, changed considerably, and thereby enlarged the financing arrangements for the board by arranging that the grant aided schools, which previously had their examination presentations paid for by the local authority, will now be making payments. We are seeking to balance the board's income and expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers that the Secretary of State is taking are similar to the powers accorded to local authorities. They also have to seek his approval before entering into such commitments. The board will now deal direct with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, but will still require the approval of the Secretary of State for capital expenditure. The cost of financing any borrowings or leases will fall on the general charges of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As stated in the document, we intend that the board's income and expenditure should balance on a year-by- year basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put it simply in non-accounting terms, the effect of the amendment will be that the cost of sitting examinations will increase, even though direct grant schools have not hitherto had to pay for their presentations. We cannot be told at this stage whether the cost of borrowing the money will be more or less
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>733</span>
than the income from charging direct grant schools for presentations. Basically the Minister is telling us that the new arrangement will result in dearer exams if there is a need for major expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. What the hon. Gentleman is saying is correct, except that it must be remembered that the new premises that the board now occupy make it unlikely that any substantial expenditure under this heading is likely to be necessary in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a note here which states that with 500,000 presentations, the additional cost per presentation for the £500,000 of expenditure in the new premises would work out at about 12p per presentation. So if, at this stage, we were to incur a £500,000 expense, it would amount to about 12p per presentation. Such a sum would not cause great headaches either to the local authorities or to the independent schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points. First, if the sum has to be borne by Strathclyde region, it will be substantial. Secondly, do I take it that it is to be only in respect of the acquisition of land? The Minister drew an analogy with the new provisions of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, which is concerned with capital allocations. The provisions seek to define the grey area in respect of the leasing of equipment. I wonder whether the computer which the Scottish certificate of education examination board has, which is an integral part of its operation, or the leasing of time on that computer, constitutes such major expenditure that it would come under capital allocation controls to be applied to local government by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be a wee bit complicated at this late hour for the Minister and his advisers to sort out. He may return to it on Report if he wishes. But once we started digging into what appears to be a fairly rich seam, there were a few points on which the Minister's replies were less than full. I do not blame him, because he provided a handout, but he did not give the detail that may have been required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment refers only to land, but the term "land" is defined in schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978 as including buildings and other structures. The phrase "acquisition of land" is sufficient to embrace the extension of existing premises owned by the board, the provision of new premises or land owned by the board or the building of completely new premises on a greenfield site which the board would have to acquire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is currently grant-aiding the board under regulations for its part in the Munn and Dunning programme—about £380,000 at November 1980 prices. The same regulations were used to give a grant of £10,024 to the board in March 1979 for the purchase of a mini-computer. So there are regulations that allow the Secretary of State to make such grants. The hon. Gentleman is asking whether those regulations will still be available under the new arrangements in the event of, for example, the replacement of the computer. I shall advise him on that at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer briefly to amendment No.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>734</span>
212. It is linked to the proposed subsection (1A), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board may appoint such officers, servants and agents as the Board may determine"—</p></blockquote>
that is fair enough—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and they shall be appointed at such remuneration and on such other terms and conditions as the Board may determine",</p></blockquote>
which is bad enough. When the approval of COSLA must be added, where do negotiations come into it? Where is the reference to the body which will represent these employees? Who will negotiate for them and ensure that they are protected under trade union legislation? It is not contained in the next clause regarding teachers' remuneration, which gives details of negotiations for pay, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those employed by the board are not all full-time employees. Many are part-time employed, once a year to mark papers. There ought to be a system for negotiation of a proper rate for the job, so that it is done more effectively and paid better. It is, as my hon. Friend said earlier, an onerous task, and it does not attract great remuneration. Perhaps the Minister could tell us, very briefly, whether there is some machinery by which this is negotiated by the full-time and part-time employees so that a proper rate is arrived at, or whether the board decides it and that is that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board is indeed responsible for its employees. Under the arrangements now being made with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the local authorities, as they are footing the bill, will have to approve the arrangements made by the board. The board will do the negotiating, and once it has reached agreement with its staff it will submit the agreement to COSLA; but COSLA has the right to approve the rates and the terms before any deal is struck with the board. As COSLA foots the bill, that should not surprise the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) that the regulations to which I referred for development programmes and the purchase of a computer are the Educational Development Research and Services Regulations 1946, and they will still apply for such items under the new arrangements. On the one hand there is the need to seek approval for land, which we have discussed, and on the other there is the point that hon. Gentleman made about developments and about purchases of computers and any other relevant matters. Grant will still be available from the Secretary of State under these regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"until its repeal under subsection (8) below".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 163, in page 38, line 8, leave out subsection (8).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complicated little issue, and I strongly suspect that, in the course of the last debate, my hon. Friend to some extent provided the answers to the problems that were in my mind when I tabled the amendment. It refers to section 129(6) of the 1980 Act, which gives the Secretary of State power to make grants to the board for its general expenses. He is not compelled to make those grants, but he has power to do so. I suggest to my hon. Friend that it would not be wise to take away that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disturbs me is that, when I read subsections (7) and (8) of clause 13,1 got the feeling that that power may well be being removed. I have no objection to the words that subsection (7) would add to the 1980 Act, but I do not see the point in suggesting that at some time in the future the whole provision will be repealed, which is what I think is meant. Under my amendment, the words would be added to the 1980 Act but the power to repeal which is incorporated in subsections (7) and (8) would be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Secretary of State should still have power to give the board grants on certain conditions. If I understood some of the remarks in the last debate correctly, the regulations exist that will give the Secretary of State such power. If that is the case, I shall be happy that my probing amendment has achieved its object, but I would be disturbed if I thought that the net result of the two subsections at some stage in future, when the Secretary of State perhaps wanted to give the board money for Dunning or son of Dunning, when that arrives, or whatever other project he may want the board to undertake, would be to prevent his doing so. I should like to know that he had the power to grant the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). He correctly understood what I said in reply to the previous amendment. The Secretary of State's grant-giving powers under the 1946 regulations will prevail after the change has been made, to include such matters as Munn and Dunning, and other developments that he may wish to introduce. Clearly, that is important for the continued working of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we are anxious that the board should now be self-financing. We want to remove the general power to finance its ordinary activities. If we leave matters there, COSLA and the board might feel that they do not have to be too precise in their financial arrangements because the Secretary of State would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>736</span>
always be there to bail them out. So, by removing the normal revenue and expenditure implications, we believe that we are imposing a necessary financial discipline on the board and the Convention. However, we are leaving in the Secretary of State's grant-giving rights. To that extent, we are meeting my hon. Friend's main objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the amendments to the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board regulations 1963. Various legislation is referred to in the introduction relating to the functions and membership, and financial and other operations of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister said that there was additional legislation—namely, the 1946 Act—which empowered the Secretary of State to make grants for specific projects that could be connected with the board. Should not that be included in the first paragraph of the regulations, as it relates to the funding of some of the board's activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding—I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman If I am wrong—is that the first paragraph deals with those regulations which are affected by the changes that we are making in the scheme. But the 1946 regulations will still apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied with that assurance, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 38, line 9, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) An education authority shall not have the power to recover from pupils or their parents payments made to the Board by the authority in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 	<i>(bb)</i> of subsection (4) of section 129 of this Act, in respect of presentations of such pupils for examinations conducted by the said Board".</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friends will gather, the temptation for me to keep the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) here all night is great, but I shall not do so because he is looking tired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment arises from a proposal earlier in the clause to change the method of charging for examinations. The new method means that authorities will be charged on the basis of the candidates to be presented. Private schools will be charged on the same basis. I believe that the arrangement is perfectly fair to both categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that some authorities may decide that, as the charge is being put on them per presentation, they can recover some—or all—of the money by charging the pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister may well tell me that my fears are groundless, that examinations by SCEEB are part of the education system—I believe that they are an important part—and that therefore there can be no charge, because that would come under section 3(1) of the original Act, which says that education will be

provided by an education authority without payment of fees. I am looking for an assurance from my hon Friend that the fees for SCEEB are included in section 3(1) of the original Act and, therefore, that there is no danger that the authorities may decide, at some time in the future, to pass on the charge to pupils for presentation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only for the pleasure of saying that, for the first and probably the only time on this Bill, I agree with the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) in the amendment that he has tabled. That will probably convince him that he is totally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I think that it would be wrong for parents to be charged for examinations. I hope that the hon. Member will agree that that should be total and absolute. In the independent schools, the examinations should be included in the fees and not be a separate charge. In further education colleges, where people pay to do the course, they should not then have to pay an extra fee to sit the examination. That is what happens now, and I hope the Minister will take that into account and make the sitting of examinations totally free in all cases, payable by the existing authorities rather than by the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When the opportunity comes to vote on it, we shall be happy to support it. However, I would point out that there is a certain problem. When local authorities are charged for presentation to examinations under the new arrangement, some of them may seek to exert pressure on schools to be more careful in the number of students that they present for examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was an employee of Lothian region, I remember having strictures made on me, at least from the columns of the Edinburgh 	<i>Evening News,</i> by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) in his previous incarnation. However, I am happy to say that the strictures that he made on the school in which I worked were ignored. No restrictions were ever placed upon the presentation of pupils to examinations. I recognise that we are now in a different financial climate and that the new system of charging may result in fewer pupils being presented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, we welcome this attempt to ensure that children will not be charged for the privilege of sitting examinations, because we do not think that the sitting of an examination is a privilege. Some people would say that it is an intolerable chore and a burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we insist that it is the right of any child who embarks upon a course of education and who fulfils the requirements of the course to sit the examination at the end of the period without financial or economic hindrance. We therefore give the amendment our unreserved support and hope that the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) will take his courage in both hands and not seek to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that that may result in a severe thrashing from the pugilistic Whip, who has been straining at the leash. He thought for a little while this evening that the Under-Secretary of State the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve)—the petrol rebel—would abscond, but we realise that there has been some arm-twisting outside and he is here. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>738</span>
appreciate that he is here either because of the efforts of the pugilistic Whip or because the Whip merely threatened him. If that is the case, I shudder to think what fate will befall the hon. Member for Argyll once the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) gets his dander up. We say to the hon. Member for Argyll "Keep your courage up and we shall support you". We shall go into the Lobby on his side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who will have a truly nightmare rest when the Committee eventually rises and he gets to bed. The prospect of having the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and myself will present the hon. Member with some problems. However, I know that the hon. Members for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and South Angus (Mr. Fraser) will know to whom I refer when I say that I am pleased to note that regional authorities will not be allowed to charge parents or pupils for exams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wonder whether that covers deposits and whether a parent will have to put down a deposit. During the debate on the Education Bill covering England and Wales, an hon. Member raised the fact that one authority was suggesting that an amount—I think that it was a tenner—should be charged as a deposit for sitting exams. I hope that that will not end up in this legislation if it ever reaches the statute book. I certainly hope that the matter is covered in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to gain further assurance from the Minister about a matter which I believe was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart on Second Reading. In regard to charging for sitting exams run by the SCE exams board, the reply he received was along the lines that the Minister would assure him that the local authorities will not have such powers. I believe that it is relevant to raise that issue, especially in regard to the levying of charges. Once some Tory regions are deprived of the power to charge for exams, they may attempt to save money—and we know how fastidiously the Tay-side region attempted to save money. They may decide to save money by not presenting all the pupils for the exams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) or I are scaremongering on the issue because the Education Institute of Scotland raised that matter when it supplied the Committee with information. In regard to the clause the EIS said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A possible danger in the proposed new arrangements for financing the board is that education authorities may feel under some pressure to limit presentations for SCE examinations in the schools under their management in order to save money."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of the EIS and it is our view that every pupil who goes through the course should have the right to be presented for the exam. That right should be guaranteed as a right and it should not be left to the diktat of the regional authority, which may be concerned about the amount of money that is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the EIS is concerned, the hon. Member for Argyll will also know that the SSTA is concerned on the same lines. I seek an assurance from the Minister that appointments are of vital importance so far as

parents in Dundee are concerned because we have to contend with a Tayside regional council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that children on Tayside do not do well in examinations, because that is contrary to theevidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assurances that I seek from the Minister concern the rights which may be given to regional authorities to consider the matter of the presentation of pupils for exams on the basis of expenditure rather than on the basis of the child going through the course and having the right to sit that exam. So far as our experience of Tayside region is concerned, the Dundee division would certainly wish to have that assurance from the Minister on the record. We could then use that against the Tayside region if it should decide to cut the education budget even further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I should welcome the hon. Member for the North Bank back to the Committee. I hope that he did not have too many embarrassing experiences in a kilt—offering whisky to Arab mayors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put the matter right, for the record, I was in Kuwait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in Kuwait, One is arrested if one brings whisky in through the airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) that his interpretation of the legislation is correct. Under the existing provisions the authorities have no power to charge fees for examination presentations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has not changed. There is no financial expenditure by local authorities under these arrangements which did not exist previously. The previous position was that the Secretary of State paid the examination board and then divided that cost among the local authorities. The new arrangement is that the local authorities will deal directly with the board and pay according to the presentations that they make. It is an accounting change, although it has a good deal to do with the financial control of the examination board as well. There was no excuse in the past, and there will be even less excuse in the future, for saying that because of this change in arrangements putting pupils up for examinations cannot be afforded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the assurance that my hon.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct a misleading impression created by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), during the debate on the last amendment, about the advice given by Lothian regional council a few years ago with regard to presentation policy. I agree with what the Minister suggests and the new financial arrangements for the board. That is one of the few things that I was responsible for on the board. I think that it is the right thing. What the Lothian regional council tried to do was to make sure that teachers understood the relationship between presentation and cost, and that is not a bad thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not oppose the clause. The first part is a small step forward in broadening the membership so that it represents a wider area of education and educational interest in Scotland. I welcome subsection (3)(6), which means that colleges of education and centre institutions are represented, rather than the governing bodies of those institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to put down a marker. I still do not feel that certain organisations in Scotland which represent educational interests, indirectly if not directly, should be omitted. I should wish, for instance, to see a clear representation of the Scottish TUC on the board. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] The examination board must be the only organisation of this kind in Scotland on which the STUC is not represented, and I do not see why it should not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, there is no representation of industrial training boards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the CBI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. The industrial training boards probably take more pupils who have passed through the examination system. The hon. Member for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it correct that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) should address a statement to me, when the hon. Gentleman in question is my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very confusing, and it is very late. We should proceed with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we know,

The industrial training boards and other organisations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>742</span>
of that nature take a higher percentage of pupils for training than the universities. If the universities can have representation on the board, so should the industrial training boards. Therefore, I am putting down a marker. At least my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will agree that we shall put down amendments on Report accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The industrial training boards that have been mentioned are made up of employers, educationists and others.
