</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments in this long list all relate to the same point—that, in my view and the view of certain organisations, there has not been sufficient consultation about new negotiating machinery to warrant the Government's legislating for the machinery at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I speak about the amendments, it is necessary for me—with your leave, Mr. Gourlay—to say something about the background. The new sections stem
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
from the report of the committee of inquiry into the pay of non-university teachers, presented in December 1974 and commonly known as the Houghton report on the pay of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report led to many changes. Its main results were a large pay settlement for teachers and changes in the structures of the promotion scales and so on. Its recommendations also included the recommendation that negotiating machineries in Scotland should be reorganised in two respects: first, that the salaries committees and the conditions of service committees should be brought together into one joint negotiating machine, and, secondly, the post-school system should be separated from the school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there are about five negotiating committees in Scotland: the salaries committee for school teachers and lecturers in further education, the salaries committee for lecturers in colleges of education, the salaries committee for lecturers in central institutions, a conditions of service committee for teachers and FE lecturers, and a conditions of service committee for lecturers in colleges of education. As far as I am aware, there is no conditions of service committee for lecturers in central institutions. Houghton suggested that those should all be brought within two committees —one for teachers and one for lecturers in the three different sectors of further education, colleges of education and centre institutions—and formed into one negotiating machine. The Houghton Committee brought the salary scales for all lecturers into a common grouping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was published in December 1974. During the seven years since then all those committees have continued their negotiations. With the exception of the occasional normal interruption of good industrial relations in the sectors concerned, the committees have not been especially bad at negotiating salaries and conditions of service. There is a question-mark over whether, seven years after the negotiating committees now proposed were recommended, it is still necessary to introduce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For almost five years, until I entered the House, I was a staff side member of the salaries and conditions of service committees that negotiated the post-Houghton settlements in the colleges of education sector—that is, two out of a total of five committees. Throughout 1975 we were requested by the Secretary of State's advisers to make written submissions about the proposals for new negotiating machinery. However, throughout my five years on the committees I never attended a meeting with a Minister or his advisers to discuss the new negotiating committee or to consult with anyone about it. Our written submissions were soon forgotten. Every so often we would write a letter asking what had happened to the new negotiating machinery and when it would be introduced. The reply was always that the Minister was still considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, throughout that period— certainly in the colleges of education sector, and, I believe, in the centre institution sector too—the trade union that represented lecturers and participated in the negotiating machinery had no meetings with Ministers or civil servants for consultation about the nature of the new machinery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened with some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
interest to the hon Gentleman's remarks. I do not wish to be too restrictive, but I must point out that the amendments do not concern the aspect to which the hon Gentleman is referring. The House has already decided that there will be new machinery. The merits of that decision may—only "may"—come into a clause stand part debate; they certainly may not be debated under the amendments. I do not mind some references to the matter, but the hon Gentleman must not adduce long arguments for or against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Gourlay. I have tried to mention only the major aspects that are relevant as background to the amendments. I was trying to stress that there had been no consultation, and that it was bad industrial relations practice to set up a negotiating committee without fully consulting the organisations concerned about what the machinery, once established, should be. The Bill establishes new negotiating machinery, yet the Secretary of State has not so far consulted fully with all the organisations concerned—I accept that he has consulted some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, before we make law this part of the Bill, we should ensure that there is consultation to establish whether there is agreement between employers and registered trade unions. Proper negotiating machinery which suits both sides could be established without the Secretary of State having to impose it upon them, which is what would happen under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the negotiating committee have expressed reservations about certain parts of the Bill. It seems to me to be good practice in industrial relations—which the Government keep saying that they want—to handle the matter by consultation and to find agreement. If agreement cannot be found, the Secretary of State may then have to impose this machinery upon the two sides. But I do not believe that consultation has been fully carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nearly all the amendments in this group are concerned with consultation. They seek to set up a way in which the two sides can come together with the Secretary of State and agree the negotiating machinery required. That would be proper negotiating machinery. In most other industries—certainly in the private sector—negotiating machineries are set up by trade unions and employers working together, to find what form the negotiating machinery should take, how many people should be involved, which trade unions and employers should be represented, and how they should be represented, and what arbitration procedure there will be. All those things are decided in the early stages by employers and employees in negotiation, and are not imposed from above by a Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point running through the amendments concerns the employees' side. It is proposed in section 92(1) that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may, for the purpose of setting up the committee, invite any body which appears to him to be representative of teaching staff".</p></blockquote>
I have suggested that within the law—this is one of the things that the law has changed since the introduction of the Houghton report—there are recognised bodies which represent employees and that they are registered trade unions. Within the school and post
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
school sectors, recognised registered trade unions— all, I think, affiliated to the STUC—represent the large majority of people in their sectors. They probably have higher percentages of membership than most other trade unions have in their own sectors. Yet the Secretary of State proposes that he will
	<br><blockquote><p>"invite any body which appears to him to be representative of teaching staff".</p></blockquote>
In the negotiating machinery that I took part in, 96 per cent, of the people for whom we were negotiating were members of the union which I represented: a registered trade union. But there was one other organisation—the Association of Higher Academic Staff in Colleges of Education—representing assistant principals, deputy principals and principals, a small percentage of the total work force, which was written into the negotiating machinery with negotiating rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally there are only two votes in a negotiating machinery—a staff-side vote and a management-side vote. That gave almost a power of veto to one representative from this non-representative organisation on the staff side. If he spoke out against the agreement, the chairman was entitled to say that there was no agreement on the staff side, and so he could not accept that staff-side submission. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is frowning, but that was how it operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasions that created immense problems. These organisations have a very small membership. They do not have sufficient funds or organisation to warrant being a registered trade union even if they wished to apply. If they wanted to apply they would be eliminated. The Registrar for Trade Unions and Employers' Associations would not accept them as a trade union. Therefore, they should not be entitled to seats on the negotiating machinery, when I am sure that the Government want to see proper industrial negotiations carried out between employers and employers' bodies which generally represent employers and the employees represented by bodies which are recognised in law as being representative of the workers concerned. I should have thought that that was a basic principle which even the Government would accept as necessary if good industrial relations are to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my amendment would ensure, if the Government accept it—there is no reason why they should not—that only bodies which are recognised trade unions shall have rights of negotiation in those committees. It would allow for clearer-cut negotiations, which, I am sure the Government would like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon Friends may wish to say something about this matter. I know that my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire was for four years a member of the management side on a negotiating committee. In fact, I believe that at one time he was the chairman of a teachers' salary-negotiating machinery. One of the results of being elected is that one has, to some extent, to be a manager. I certainly think that he was a very good chairman. I hope that he will wish from his experience to say what he thinks the new negotiating machinery ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that these amendments will help to establish better practices in negotiations for the teaching pro
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
fession. Matters will not improve if the Bill goes through unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was critical of the consultation. That seemed to be the main theme of his remarks. His main complaint was that there had not been sufficient consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that changes should be made in the negotiating committees started with Houghton in 1974. In 1976 extensive discussions took place on that report, and there was a large measure of agreement among the main teacher bodies, which felt that the Houghton proposals would be helpful and should be introduced. I do not wish to make a party point now, but it is clear that the previous Labour Government had the opportunity of introducing such legislation and of taking advantage of those recommendations and the agreement that then existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was published on 10 December 1980, so clause 14 cannot be said to take anyone by surprise. Indeed, our intentions were known many months before that. But it is our intention, subject to parliamentary approval of the Bill, to consult employers, trade unions representing teachers and others who can make a contribution, or who have asked to be consulted before the new negotiating committees are set up initially. I do not, therefore, see any necessity to amend the Bill to secure what will happen anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "employers" would not include the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities—I am referring to amendments Nos. 231 and 238—which we wish to consult. The term "registered trade unions"—I believe that the correct term is in fact "listed trade unions"—would exclude at least one association which is at present represented on a negotiating committee, namely the Association of Higher Academic Staff in Colleges of Education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that, without prejudice to the eventual outcome of consultations, I am not at present prepared to say that particular organisations will or will not be represented on the negotiating committees. It is not necessary for me to do so, because the way in which the Bill is drafted gives us the flexibility to undertake wide-ranging consultations. I believe that that deals with the hon Gentleman's main point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendments Nos. 234 and 241 would be that, instead of the Secretary of State prescribing the maximum number of places on negotiating committees for his own representatives, management and staff, the number of persons on the Committee would be agreed in consultation between the Secretary of State, employers and trade unions. We are not anxious that the Secretary of State should be involved in the constitution of the negotiating committees to any greater extent than is strictly necessary, but I see no feasible alternative to the arrangement proposed. Someone must decide how many members there will be, and what the general balance of representation on the committee will be. This will be done after consultation with the affected interests, but at some point there must be a clear decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine a better recipe for confusion and delay in setting up the new negotiating machinery than that such a decision must depend on agreement being
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
reached between various interests that are almost bound to have differing views. Some of them will wish to go back to the beginning with a clean sheet and fresh ideas and to throw aside the years of consideration that have been given to these proposals. But we must make progress. I have already said that the previous Labour Government should have made progress—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the opinion of this Government, which is borne out by experience, that the issue of salaries and conditions of service should be considered together. We wish to make progress along those lines. Realistic consideration and discussion of salaries or conditions of service, or both, must take place in the same committee, because one cannot be discussed without the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 235 and 244 propose that, instead of the Secretary of State determining which bodies should be invited to nominate persons to the new negotiating committees on their first being constituted, different methods should be laid down. The proposed method of constituting the negotiating committees would not be an improvement on what is proposed in the Bill—which is that the Secretary of State should be responsible for the initial constitution of the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendments 236 and 245 would be that in either of the proposed new negotiating bodies, after they were initially constituted, the teachers' side could invite only registered trade unions to nominate a person to membership of the committee. The amendments appear to be unduly restrictive on the choice that could be exercised by the teachers' side of the committee. As I have said already, at least one teaching staff association which is at present represented on a Scottish negotiating committee is not a listed trade union. It is not right to exclude the possibility that such a body might in the future be invited to nominate a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I recommend that the Committee should not accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) for raising these points. I imagine that they were probing amendments. The Minister said that some of the amendments to existing procedures could have been made in 1976, when consultations took place. The times when changes to negotiating procedures are acceptable tend to depend on the climate of opinion in the relevant area of activity at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the industrial and economic climate in 1976 it was probably not appropriate to introduce the far-reaching changes which were in the minds of both management and unions. The Opposition submit that the present time is even less appropriate, with the prospect of teacher unemployment, the promise of further cuts in educational expenditure, and teachers' morale being by no stretch of the imagination buoyant or high. Consequently, it is inappropriate to institute a series of changes which could be brought in later by other education Bills or miscellaneous provisions legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
My hon Friend the Member for Cathcart raised a point on consultations. We are unhappy that the Minister, having said that consultations took place in 1976, proceeded to say that nothing meaningful had happened for the past five years, but that consultation will take place after the legislation has been enacted. The Opposition feel that more consultations could have taken place beforehand, especially about the fears and misgivings expressed by some of the small unions about the membership of the committees and the proportions that should be involved. We shall obviously look at this matter when we consider the composition of the committees rather than simply their constitution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have had a view beforehand on "proportional representation on the committees, as embodied in amendments Nos. 235 and 244. We think that it is slightly disingenuous, and mildly insulting to the responsible bodies which would want to be represented on this body and which would want to know the ground rules clearly beforehand, to refer to it somewhat coyly as a matter which would be appropriate for discussion after the Bill had become an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the words "registered trade unions", I hope that in colleges of education the Association of Higher Academic Staff in Colleges of Education may seek to become what is, as the Minister correctly says, a listed trade union and then perhaps it would be regarded as the principal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to my hon Friend that to become a listed or registered trade union, whichever term one likes to use, a body has to go through a careful inspection by the Registrar or his staff. It has to show membership and sufficient resources, and meet a variety of other requirements. They go right through the books, the constitution and related matters. The association in question consists of no more than 40 people. Even the organisation of which I was a member was lucky to become a listed trade union, because of its size. But I assure my hon Friend that never would an organisation with 40 members be accepted by the Registrar as a listed trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One always harks back in these instances to the Association of Jewish Bakers. However, I shall not go back through the dark, distant past of British trade union history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been a teacher and a member of only one union, I have always felt that the best solution to the industrial relations problems of the teaching profession is that teachers should all be members of one educational union for Scotland. I leave it to the discretion of individuals to decide which union they would wish to dub the most appropriate organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go further and say that I should have thought that this union would be appropriate for college lecturers and others. But it is not for me to tell other people in the teaching profession which unions they should join. I know that some people take the safe way out and join as many unions as possible, and that covers the ground. I think that my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart is in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to be aware that there are deep-seated mis
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
givings. 	<i>(Interruption.)</i> I hope that today we shall be preserved from the levity with which the Minister has treated much of our proceedings. We shall try to get through our business, because we know that the Minister himself has expressly asked the Opposition to be as brief as possible. Therefore, we should appreciate it if he would keep his mouth shut until he is on his feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should welcome the initiative of my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart in raising these points and for showing clearly that all the teaching organisations in Scotland have grave misgivings about the manner in which the Government have approached the clause. We realise that consultations have taken place on other parts of the legislation, and on other parts of the clause. Nevertheless, in terms of the membership of the future committees, we feel that more consideration ought to have been given to what would well be the worries and misgivings of the teachers' organisations, whether registered or listed trade unions, or bodies of principals and "high heid yins" in colleges of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we hope that the Minister will take this issue on board. He has said that he will have consultations. We hope that those consultations will start before Report, so that the Minister will have a chance to take these matters on board and take more seriously than he has done already the worries of some of the smaller organisations in particular. They are very conscious of their lack of clout in these matters and would look to the generosity of some of the larger organisations in these committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the non-listed trade union, apart from joining the other unions to form one large union, it may be possible for it to seek listing. Alternatively, it will be up to the members of the committee, on the trade union side I imagine, to decide whether that small body should be represented. So to an extent the solution rests in the hands of the members, although I should be interested to hear what the Secretary of State would say if one teachers' union sought to exclude other groups. Grave misgivings have been expressed across the board about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be more appropriate to deal with the matter under another group of amendments. But the Under-Secretary must address himself to the problem this morning, or during whatever time it takes us to deal with this group of amendments. He cannot do his Pontius Pilate trick again. His hands must be the cleanest in Scotland. Of every piece of legislation, he says "I wash my hands of it and I shall have nothing to do with it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will have to assure the bodies involved that he will protect the rights of small groups. In one instance, he may have to protect the interests of what in other respects would be regarded as the largest group. No group within the spectrum of teaching negotiating procedures on the staff side will be free from the threat of possible exclusion by the bloody-mindedness or otherwise of a coalition of groups within the committee. The Minister must address himself to that this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Friends, I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) for tabling all the amendments, most of which I agree with. In the spirit of good nature that has persisted so far this morning, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
agree with the Under-Secretary that legislation should have been forthcoming before now to reorganise the negotiating body. I should like to have seen the previous Government introduce legislation, and I was one of those who pressed them for changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is wrong for the Under-Secretary to call in aid consultations that took place under the previous Government as relevant to what the present Government are doing. I am open to correction, but I understand that the papers relating to consultations undertaken by the previous Government are not available to the present Government, and that, therefore, the proposals put forward by the unions and local authorities in those consultations are not available to them either. So my hon Friend the Member for Cathcart is right to say that no consultations were undertaken before publication of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial changes have taken place since 1976, so even if the proposals are officially available to the Government they may not be relevant now. The experiences of teachers' unions have made them tend to see the matter somewhat differently now from the way in which they saw it in 1976. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that he has received correspondence from the Educational Institute of Scotland reviving the concept of a standing commission to deal with teachers' pay, which would be totally different from the method proposed in this legislation? If so, will he comment upon it? It throws a spanner into the works of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that the period of consultation began with the publication of the Bill, and said that since the publication of the Bill people had had enough time to consider the Government's proposals and comment on them, and that he had received comments from a number of organisations. The major teachers' union in Scotland—the union that represents the vast majority of teachers—states that it is now asking the Secretary of State to consider a type of machinery that is totally different from that suggested in the legislation, a type of machinery that has a totally different base and would operate in a totally different way. Will the union's representations be completely ignored? Does the Under-Secretary say that they are not relevant? Does he say that they will be thrown aside?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the period of consultation runs from the publication of the Bill to its enactment, this is the time when we should be discussing these matters. The union's suggestions represent a major proposal by the major trade union for a totally different scheme. If the Under-Secretary is serious, I hope that he will comment on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary will not accept what the Educational Institute of Scotland suggests, if he intends to go ahead with the proposals in the Bill, or proposals on those lines, I should like to ask him one question about the membership of the management side of the post-school negotiating body. In passing, I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree to change the name of that body from "further education" to the better phrase suggested by my hon Friend in a later amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Non-university post-school education."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary say whether he will go into the consultations about the composition of the management side of that committee with an initial view—although of course he must be open to persuasion—that the management side must include a majority of representatives from the local authorities? The local authorities employ the majority of teachers in that sector, but I suspect that the pressure from the governing bodies of the centre institutions and the colleges of education will be great, because there are many people on that side who are relatively influential in the world of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there will be pressure for more representation for those two sectors. I think that in the submission sent by the EIS to members of the Committee it was stated that about 70 per cent, of students in this sector were in local authority further education colleges. I hope that the Secretary of State will go into the consultations with the initial view—and I hope that he will maintain that view—that the majority of members of the management side on that negotiating body should be from the local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little else that I want to say on this matter, as my hon Friends and I have agreed only to make points that are really important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response lacked any detail about the process of consultation that has taken place. To set up a machinery in which one gives the Secretary of State all sorts of powers to prescribe who should and who should not be on the committee, and to carry out the consultative process thereafter, seems to me to be totally wrong. That is the wrong way round. The consultation should come first, and the parties should come as close as they can to an agreement, although I accept that it would be difficult to reach a unanimous agreement about the composition of the committee, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there have been separate consultations between different bodies, no one has brought all the organisations together and tried to thrash out an agreement. That should be done before a Bill is introduced giving the Secretary of State such power, at least on the surface. I consider it to be irrelevant whether or not he uses that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look carefully at the words in a Bill and try to work out what they mean. I may be wrong, but I do not take the Minister's interpretation as being somehow different. He may say that we should not worry, because consultations will take place. While the Secretary of State will have power to decide who will sit on the committee and the maximum number on each side, the hon Gentleman says that he will make that decision through a process of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the Minister's track record on consultation. An example that has been used before is the college of education. He promised that his proposals would be open to consultation, but then flatly refused to consult. With that sort of track record, the Opposition and outside organisations are entitled to feel more than a bit suspicious about the Minister's promises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have consulted beforehand. I accept that five years is a long time, but I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
remember any consultations. We made written submissions in 1976, but there were no meetings to discuss the college of education sector. I accept that it was not the present Minister, but the trade unions at that time were pushing the Government to make a decision on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the position has been reversed. I am worried because the Minister now insists that the measure be put into law despite the fact that there has been little consultation. Nearly seven years have elapsed since the original proposal. Now there has been a change. My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said that teachers' morale was declining because they were facing the problem of falling rolls and were no longer so happy to go along with the sort of negotiating machinery proposed by the Houghton Committee. As my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) pointed out, they hoped that a different type of system could be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is introducing the original proposal after a seven-year delay. There have been no immense problems in the system. It has continued to operate reasonably satisfactorily. If there are no great problems, why can he not delay a little longer and consider the principles again? It may be that after seven years circumstances have changed so much that the Houghton recommendations are no longer valid. Why should he not go back to first principles and consider it again and come to an agreed solution? The Minister should consider the idea of a standing commission on pay, which was suggested in evidence submitted to Houghton, but was rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said about separate trade unions, though he may find that surprising. It would be better if we had two trade unions, one representing teachers and the other possibly representing those in the post-school sector. However, we have to compete with a historical background. On occasions the secretary of the EIS and I have sought by various means to bring in two trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As was mentioned when we discussed clause 13 with respect to the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board, it is possible that there will be more inter-relationship between the sections of what has hitherto been called tertiary education— education concerned with the needs of the post-16 age group. Rather than the differences becoming more clearly defined, there could well be a blurring of the distinctions between the two groups, even in terms of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much support among Opposition hon Members for the idea of a unitary system of education for the over-16s. We shall not be specific about that at this stage, but it would be unfortunate to talk in trade-union terms of creating obstacles that would serve only to make the realisation of that goal more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, Mr. Gourlay, that if I go too far along a certain path you will get edgy, to say the least—in your case that is a literal description, as you begin to move to the edge of your seat. You give speakers who watch you a fair chance to ensure that they do not stray out of order, as you stay on the edge
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
of your chair for some time before calling an hon Member to order. I shall therefore not stray too far down that path. May I simply say that with regard to trade union representation some of us who were involved have attempted—I must confess not very successfully—to find a better way of ensuring that there is less fragmentation and fewer disputes between the various organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reasons for wishing to see the process of consultation carried out are twofold. The first is to ensure that we obtain the proper negotiating machinery. The second is to allow the trade unions to get together again and try again to achieve one organisation, or perhaps two, with the division between them slightly blurred. Many of us sought that type of solution, and I hope that it can still be achieved. My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) must be clear that efforts have been made to do as he suggests. I hope that those efforts will continue, but I am not sure that introducing the proposed machinery now will make that task easier for the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said about amendment No. 231, although I consider it to be a matter of interpretation and not as clear-cut as the Minister implied. The words "all employers" could perhaps be interpreted as not including COSLA. The Minister is also probably right to say that the term should be "listed trade unions" rather than "registered trade unions". In view of that, and so that the matter may be discussed more fully on the Floor of the House on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 38, leave out lines 17 to 22 and insert:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to meet each year at such date in January as the Committee may decide, to consider; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>to formulate a settlement as to what shall be,". </p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 239, in page 41,leave out lines 7 to 12 and insert:—

	<br><blockquote><p>to formulate a settlement as to what shall be,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording of the two amendments is the same, as they attempt to make the same amendment to the procedure of two different negotiating machineries. Under the Bill as drafted the functions of the committee are
	<br><blockquote><p>(a)"whenever so required by the Secretary of State, or (in the absence of such requirement) whenever it thinks fit, to consider; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>whenever it thinks fit to formulate a settlement as to what shall be,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the remuneration payable".</p></blockquote>
That definition has two faults. First, it is too broad and allows the Secretary of State too much power to decide when the committee shall and shall not meet. Secondly, it allows the committee to meet yet not to formulate a settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee on which I served—what I say may not be true of the other committees—had an obligation under standing orders to meet each January to decide on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
the settlement. Clearly, that could not be decided in one meeting; further meetings had to be held. But an obligation was laid on the committee to meet in January to start the process of formulating a settlement for 1 April of the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be legitimate. If there were no inflation—that is unlikely under this Government—the committee might not have to meet every year, although 1 doubt that. Claims would still be made either to improve the relative position of teachers or to solve individual problems that had arisen. New technology, new ways of operating that might require regrading and so on would all have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is now right to put in a provision to say that the committee must meet in January to formulate a settlement rather than to leave the matter to some later vague consultative process. 1 accept that when there is no inflation the settlement that was made during the previous year will probably continue. I see that my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) thinks that my remarks are hypothetical. I agree: they are, because it is very unlikely that that would happen. But the committee should reach a definite conclusion during the process of negotiation that would take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this is not a major issue in the context of the Bill, 1 believe that it should contain such a measure. That would be better than leaving the matter as at present to the Secretary of State or to the committee itself "whenever it thinks fit". Presumably, if management did not want to meet in a particular year, it could say that neither it nor the Secretary of State wanted a meeting, so there would be no meeting, because the Bill contains nothing which states that there must be a meeting. The amendment seeks to change that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a source of frustration to many of those who are affected by wage negotiations that there is a vagueness as to when those negotiations should start. That means that in difficult years the settlement is often not paid out until teachers come back from their holidays. I have sometimes not received my back pay until 1 August or 1 September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) would probably agree that in some respects the wording of the amendment is a little deficient, but the point should be made. 1 express an interest here, because my wife is still a teacher and her prospective wages may be affected if this matter is not taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, more seriously, the provisions for arbitration which we shall discuss later make allowance for what is, to all intents and purposes, something like an eight-week period of possible delay if there is failure to agree on a settlement or if a settlement is reached which does not meet with the Minister's approval. There could also be further delays after that in relation to time taken for the necessary orders to go through the House. Therefore, the Minister should be told that as early a start as is possible in the year should be made in respect of these negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that that is difficult, because it takes this Government so long to decide on the rate support grant settlement and on what funds will be available for public sector wages. While it may be more appropriate to bring up this topic on clause stand part, it begs several
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
questions. The Minister should realise that, if "he is dealing with wages and conditions of service, and that if he gives himself various powers through the legislation which can delay the settlement of these negotiations, he should ensure that they start at a time when they can be dealt with adequately. Equally important, it should be known what money will be made available—with cash limits and rate support grant. Such information should be made available as early as possible, so that we do not have the delays we had this year because of the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There arc other pressures on the unions to settle in the present climate. I hope that the club which the Minister can wield at any group of workers will not be available to him for much longer—although as long as the present Minister is responsible for both education and employment in Scotland it will be a considerable time before this brutal weapon is removed from wage negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are unnecessarily restrictive. The committees have shown that they are capable of meeting whenever necessary. Reference has been made to the NJC on pay in the colleges of education, which has to meet in January. It had no business to conduct in January this year, but was required to meet by its standing orders. That is absurd. It is inappropriate to lay down in primary legislation the time when a committee must meet. The amendments arc not therefore helpful to anyone— least of all the committees proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is at it again.

This is not a major trade union or party political point. The amendment's aim is to tidy up sloppy drafting concerning the new negotiating machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may consider my amendment too restrictive. I consider that his clause is far too broad. It leaves too much power both in the hands of the Secretary of State and in the hands of the management side of the negotiating committee, because, in theory, there will be no meeting unless the management side agrees that there should be a meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be normal, but it is written into the constitution of the committee that it shall meet. While I was on that committee it was the first time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
that there was nothing to discuss. I do not think that it is a monstrous imposition to ask people to come to a meeting once a year, if once in nine years they have to come when there is little to discuss. I know the committee, and I doubt that there was nothing to discuss. It may not have had to discuss the pay settlement, but I am sure that it found other important business. The pay settlement was rarely the only matter to be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not, therefore, a massive obligation to lay down that there shall be one statutory meeting each year. It may be a minor matter, but I intend to press it because of the Minister's total inability to bend. It is the sign of a man who is not sure of himself and who has no confidence in his knowledge of a subject when he is incapable of compromise. The hon Gentleman has not compromised once on the Bill. This may be a minor matter, but I intend to force it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. ALBERT MCQUARRIE 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The amendments seek to remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"terms and conditions of employment".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Increasing concern has been expressed by teachers' organisations that in the current climate of declining rolls, severe Government restrictions on pay and the availability of less money for education there is a danger that management will use terms and con
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
ditions of service as a trade off for pay. The Secretary of State will be a member of both the committees on the management side. He will not be merely an adviser. There is a danger that management may say "We shall retain X number of teachers in the system if you will take only 5 per cent, increase this year instead of 10 per cent., even though the cost of living increase may have been 15 per cent."</p>
	<p>That would put union representatives and their members into a very difficult situation. They would be pressured to take reductions in their standard of living so that the jobs of other teachers may be preserved.</p>
	<p>Most unions might be forced to accept that, because unions do not want to see people losing their jobs. But it is better to keep the two areas separate as far as possible. Many conditions of service are not necessarily about pay, and they cannot always be negotiated in relation to pay. If one tries to do that one only confuses the issue.</p>
	<p>Some of my hon Friends may be able to speak a little more closely to the subject of the teachers' salary committee. I shall turn my attention to the post-school committee where the position is even more difficult. In this sector, three sets of employees are being brought together into one negotiating committee. There are the further education lecturers and the central institution lecturers. The central institutions are a disparate body including everything from Paisley college of technology to the college of art, the college of music and the college of drama, and the central institution lecturers do various jobs under different conditions. The college of education sector is also included.</p>
	<p>The present conditions of service are governed by the type of work done. The work done by the lecturers in those three sectors differs very widely. For example, further education college lecturers are, by contract and under their conditions of service, obliged to hold evening classes and to lecture to students in the evenings. That is a normal part of their work and contract. But the same is not true of the college of education sector, and it is true only of a tiny part of the central institution sector. The contract of one set of employees specifies evening work; the contracts of the others do not.</p>
	<p>I can give another example. Lecturers at colleges of education have to visit students. They may use their own cars or there may be some other travel arrangements. You will be interested in the college in Aberdeen, Mr. McQuarrie. The lecturers there cover the whole of the north of Scotland, and on occasion they have to stay away from home in order to visit students working in the schools. The college of education lecturers are therefore rightly interested in the mileage allowances and the subsistence allowances for meals and overnight stays, which are negotiated at present by the college of education conditions of service committee. The further education lecturers do not have to travel, so they are not concerned about such matters. The mileage allowance does not matter to them, because they do not travel around in that way.</p>
	<p>I could give example after example, Mr. McQuarrie, and you might let me get away with it.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
	<p>I am sure that when Mr. Gourlay returns to the Chair, he will not. The conditions in the three sectors of the post-school system differ widely from each other. I think that all three sectors fear that, if they are brought together into one committee, the lowest common denominator in terms of conditions of service will quickly become the norm, and employees will find that the result of bringing them together will be that their conditions of service are dragged down.</p>
	<p>Various grades of lecturer are involved, and, again, there may be a tendency to downgrade conditions. Certainly it is feared that that may happen in the attempt to merge them together and find common ground. Fears are expressed about the possibility of deals being made that trade off pay against conditions of service.</p>
	<p>In the post-school sector the present three divisions, all with different conditions of service, would make the task immensely difficult for the new committee to take on board. Therefore, it would be better to have a common salaries committee but to retain the existing separate conditions of service committees.</p>
	<p>Perhaps even at this late stage in our proceedings the Minister will give an answer showing that he is prepared to compromise. Speaking for myself, if the Minister produced a plan involving sub-committees— laid down in the Bill rather than worked out afterwards—or some other compromise whereby we could achieve the desired end without creating the problems that I foresee, I should be prepared to listen and to consider the idea when we decide whether and how to vote.</p>
	<p>The measure involves immense problems. I believe that at this stage it would be better to remove this provision from the Bill so as to allow it to be separately considered in an attempt to establish a satisfactory solution.</p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have referred to some of the issues involved here while discussing earlier amendments. However, we must stress again that in many areas of industrial relations conditions of employment and wages are inextricably intertwined. The differences within the education service probably result from historical factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the illustrations cited by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) need be regarded as obstacles. They are difficulties, but they need not be insurmountable obstacles. The real obstacle to the linking of the two committees now is the genuine fear of the staff side, which is caused by falling school rolls, lack of funds for education and the climate created by the Government of an unsympathetic attitude to public expenditure. The staff side fears that it is in an extremely weak position. We sympathise with that fear, but combining the two committees now is not the happiest solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government chose to be sufficiently ruthless —their past record gives us no reason to assume that they would not be—they could seek to press home their advantage to the detriment of teachers and ultimately, because of the effect on the morale of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
teaching profession, to the detriment of the quality of our children's education. Therefore, we are unhappy about the Government's intention to combine the committees, although I do not think that we go as far as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart in itemising spheres of difficulty in the wages and conditions of service negotiation procedure. But we see that, in the longer term, we shall have to be realistic and face the Government's envisaged combination of the two committees. Had the 1970s been less troubled economically—I do not apportion blame to any particular group—the post-Houghton consultations could have been effected some time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally do not wish the amendments in the names of my hon Friends and myself to be pressed to a vote now. We want to hear the Minister's comments. We may return to the topic on Report, because it is one of the central controversies in this part of the legislation. Furthermore, section 92 of the 1980 Act is a most important part of educational legislation. We hope that the Minister will note our remarks, because we do not think that such action would be appropriate at present. It would be regarded with considerable suspicion by all those in the teaching profession who might think that the Minister could use the opportunity to press home what they considered to be a somewhat unfair advantage in the context of industrial relations. If we wish to have good industrial relations, we should maintain the status quo while not ruling out the longer-term possibility of an economic climate in which more money is spent on education and advantage is taken of falling school rolls to enable staffing to be improved.

	<p>[Mr. HARRY GOURLAY 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>As I said to your colleague when he was in the Chair, Mr. Gourlay, we do not want to press the amendment now. We shall listen with interest to the Minister. We feel that what has stood the education service in good stead for many years should continue until the educational climate is better, until expenditure prospects improve and until the Minister gives us an indication of the Government's good will towards the staff side. Until we have that indication, we shall be most unhappy about the change in the arrangements that is being pushed through. Therefore, I ask the Minister to think again. We shall return to the matter on Report in the hope that we might then reach a better understanding of the Government's real intentions about education in Scotland.</p>

and conditions of service should be negotiated simultaneously, as they are for virtually everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sedentary intervention proves my point. If it does not apply to Members of Parliament, it must apply to everybody else. I am grateful to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) for enabling me to prove my point. The fact is that the two sides come together in negotiations. I have heard no reason why the two should not come together to negotiate for the teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that argument, but does not the Minister concede that if we are discussing industrial relations we are in effect discussing human relations? If we are trying to get the two sides to come to an understanding in which human relationships are involved, there has to be good will on both sides. For good reasons or bad, there is an absence of understanding on the staff side that there is a sufficiency of good will by the Government. It is incumbent on the Government to prove that they have this good will. Alternatively, if they cannot succeed in doing that, they should withdraw these proposals until both sides consent to a change in the arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why I reject that suggestion is that the views of the various branches of the teaching profession on this matter come and go with the tide. In 1974, and for some time thereafter, it seemed that the teaching unions were content that the two sides should come together. More recently, the unions appear to have taken the view that perhaps they should not. The hon Gentleman suggests that if we wait a little longer, they will return to the opinion that they held during most of the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that is a basis for denying the teaching profession the benefit of negotiating conditions of service with salary. In virtually all other sectors the two are taken together. In negotiations there must be factors that both sides can introduce as a quid pro quo from time to time. An effort must be made by both sides to try to meet the other's objectives. If the two sides cannot agree on salary and the negotiations cease, it is a dreadful waste of time and shows a lack of discipline on both sides of the committee. The simpler it is for those two points of view to be recognised, the more we should be encouraged to support such a course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is crazy to advocate that money is all that matters to the teaching profession, and that any request can be measured entirely in financial terms and not be related to the important question of conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is as fundamental to the Bill and to the Government's argument as it was to Houghton that these two elements should come together. We think that enough time has been spent by parties
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
blowing hot and cold on the matter and that it is now time for us to set up the committees and establish their procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that the EIS supported the idea in 1976 but had now moved away from it. Perhaps it might drift back again, as suggested by the hon Gentleman. It may be that the AHACS—one of the unions represented by the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—thinks that its teachers have such good conditions of service that it does not want to merge these committees in consultations about pay and conditions of service. I can understand that point of view, but, when considering the teaching profession and its salaries and conditions of service, we should not allow it to inhibit the objectives of the legislation, which I have already described. We believe that it is fundamental to good industrial relations and good negotiations to combine responsibility and desires with the discipline of bearing in mind that resources are not infinite. Consideration must always be given not just to how much, but from where—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is misrepresenting the Opposition. He sought to compare the change in attitude in some trade unions with the ebb and flow of the time. Trade unions do not change their opinions in that way. They change them for good reasons. They are responsible organisations. As we have said repeatedly, conditions in 1976 differed from conditions today. The unions have changed their attitudes because, based on their practical experience over the past two years, they do not trust the Government. It is not the ebb and flow of the tide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had successful negotiations on teachers' pay this year and last year. The most recent negotiations were responsibly conducted. I consider that it is an insult to the teaching profession to suggest that teachers do not want to consider other matters. There is often a conflict between the spokesmen and the membership of any organisation, and teachers' unions are no exception. But I cannot believe that teachers do not wish to take into account economic and other issues when considering the salary increases that they want to negotiate in committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as misrepresenting the view of Opposition Members is concerned, it is difficult to respond to one point of view from the Labour Party and fail to misrepresent another, because the hon Gentleman must be aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman corrects me and says that only two points of view are being presented by the Opposition. I shall not dispute the figures. I have said that the principle of considering salary and conditions of service together is fundamental to the Bill and is an important part of Government policy and strategy. It applies throughout the land in other committees and negotiating pro

	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
cedures. I cannot believe that it would be helpful to the teaching profession that teachers be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make an unusual beginning by saying that the Minister is partially correct in what he said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: C-minus. Do not spoil it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the few true statements that the Minister made in Committee was that in 1974, just after the publication of the Houghton report—which recommended that a single committee should deal with both salaries and conditions of service for teachers—the largest teaching union in Scotland, the EIS, was in favour of that proposal. He also went on to say, correctly, that the EIS had changed its mind and was now firmly against that proposal. The Minister omitted to explain—the EIS is not alone in this, because I understand that ALCES takes a similar view—what brought about the change of mind of the EIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are trade unions such as EIS and ALCES now firmly in favour of separate committees—one dealing with salaries and the other with conditions of service? The reason is their experience of negotiation with the Government. Last year a miserable award was offered, when inflation was well over 20 per cent, due to the Government's disastrous policies, of about 13 per cent., with strings. Then they made a similar offer without strings. Eventually, they made a marginally better offer with an extra 1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the teachers are obviously afraid that, if there is a single committee dealing with both salaries and conditions of service, the strings to which I referred may involve relaxation of teachers' contracts, reductions in staffing standards, and so on, and pressures will be brought to bear, possibly on both sides of the negotiating committee. It would be tragic if there were a repetition of what happened last year, when, directly through the Government's policies, industrial relations deteriorated to such an extent that there were strikes in many schools in Scotland. Strikes are always a tragedy, but in that case I can understand why the teachers, who felt that they had a legitimate grievance, felt impelled to strike because of the failure within the negotiating committee, due to the hyper-inflation at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the teachers are still afraid that the Minister will stomp around Scotland telling local authorities that they employ too many teachers and that there is a so-called surplus of teachers—a figure of about 6,500 has been mentioned by the Minister. He will obviously put financial and other pressures upon the authorities to sack teachers or to make them redundant. That is the climate in which negotiations will take place in the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be pressures upon the employers, and I hope that they will resist them, because of the financial constraints imposed by the Government in not giving the authorities enough in rate support grant to enable them to continue to employ the present number of teachers. The Minister is still hell-bent on closing colleges of education—another indication that he thinks that too many teachers are
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
employed. I think otherwise. We should remember that the results of decisions taken by the negotiating committee will affect not only the salaries and working conditions of teachers, but, far more importantly, the educational opportunities of thousands of school children in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have created, almost deliberately, a climate of hostility towards the teaching profession, and seem deliberately to be engineering a confrontation, not only with teachers, but with those in local authorities who will sit on the other side of the negotiating committee. In such an atmosphere, with such pressures being brought to bear, I can understand the fear of the teachers' unions, such as EIS and ALCES. I therefore think that the Minister would do well to retain the status quo—to keep separate committees for salaries and conditions of service. Teachers may otherwise feel, if they go all out for a much better salary increase, that they will have to pay for it through redundancies, relaxation of the contract or a reduction in staffing standards, which would mean a reduction in the educational opportunities of children in our schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments object, in essence, to the establishment of a single committee to deal with both wages and conditions of service. I understand that most of the hon Gentlemen on the Labour Benches, and two of them in particular, purport to speak for the teachers andlor—to quote them—the teachers' trade unions. They also talk about a change of view by one of the trade unions, and attempt to give reasons for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to what Labour hon Gentlemen have told us about the teachers' reasons. I believe that it is now time the teachers dropped the pretence that they are a professional group and accepted that they are involved and organised as a trade union group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They should therefore accept the conditions of service and employment that are normally accepted by groups organised in trade unions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some trepidation and hesitation, because I agree almost unreservedly with the Minister. This is a strange morning. I wish that the Minister would show equal generosity of mind and accept some of our suggestions. As I have said before, he has hot accepted one of our 'amendments yet.

I understand the unions' worries, which were expressed by my hon Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), and for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan).

However, when discussing legislation designed to last a long time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A long, long time.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —we should not think merely in terms of the present economic climate. We must think of what will happen after the next election, when, inevitably we shall have a Labour Government and the financial climate will improve. Teachers will
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
then be negotiating their salaries and conditions in a much more receptive and affluent atmosphere. It is therefore illogical to deal with salaries and conditions of service separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was chairman of the management side of both the negotiating committees on which I served. I found it ludicrous that we had to deal with salaries in isolation even though as those who have been EIS representatives know only too well, we could not help discussing conditions of service, too. We said—the EIS representatives agreed at the time— that it would be far more logical if the two bodies were combined. Then, had we wished to trade an improvement in service conditions for a slightly lower salary increase than the teachers had requested we should have been able to do so. Instead, we had to go through the charade of reconstituting ourselves as a different body consisting of the very same people on both sides. That seemed to me wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon Friend will not press the amendment. As I said when he was out of the room, I understand teachers' worries about the current climate, and why they have changed their minds. However, on the grounds that we are legislating for the long term we should provide a logical system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Somewhat erroneously, my name appears over amendment No. 262 on the Notice Paper—we all know that there can be printers' errors, as when a "Mr. Concannon" kept appearing the other day and we all wondered why. Irrespective of that fact, I understand the Government's position and consider that, for once, logic is on their side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There speaks management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was speaking as a representative of the management side of the negotiating committees. I shall ignore that remark, but I should like to express reservations about the change proposed by the Government. Undoubtedly the proposal has simplicity and practicality, which are always desirable, on its side. However, such general considerations cannot always be separated from what is actually happening within the education system. There could be a danger that the amalgamation of the committees would be used by the Government and the management to make changes which would not only affect teachers' remuneration and conditions of service, but might impact upon the conditions under which pupils attend schools.

bluntly, I do not. A report in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government spending in Scotland is to be cut by £128 million next year, with further cuts to follow, according to the Public Expenditure White Paper, setting out the plans for the next three years, which was published yesterday. It shows that over the three years up to 1983-84 there will be a cut of 7 per cent."—</p></blockquote>
that is in education—
"	<br><blockquote><p>The £128 million is in itself misleading, since it is drawn from statistics based on November 1979 prices. In today's terms the figure is even higher, although it is still too early to make the calculation."</p></blockquote>
Later it states that the Chancellor is budgeting for a 6 per cent, fall in education, United Kingdom-wide. So the impact of the cuts in Scotland will be that bit more severe. Against that background, I have reservations about the suggested technical change in negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a point on the subject of public expenditure, which I accept is very important, and in the context of schools in Scotland and their populations, to which the hon Gentleman did not refer. In the period covered by the Public Expenditure White Paper, the number of pupils in schools in Scotland is expected to fall by about 100,000—a 14 per cent, reduction in the pupil roll. School expenditure in the same period is budgeted to fall by £50 million—7 per cent. The pupil-teacher ratio will improve marginally—it will certainly not worsen—in that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the pupil-teacher ratio will improve.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak on the more fundamental matter, Mr. Gourlay. I do not understand the point made by the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), regardless of the validity of any argument about cuts or otherwise. If the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) accepts, as the hon Member for South Ayrshire said, that those who negotiate will be the same, I cannot believe that they will be so stupid or naive as not to understand arguments. In that case, they will deal with them without having to change their hats in mid-course. If they will be the same people, which by all accounts they will, what is the difficulty about negotiating toughly or weakly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson.</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to develop my argument, but the hon Gentleman's point is pertinent. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) has practical experience in this matter, and one must bow to that to an extent. But it should also be pointed out that the EIS, for example, believes that there would be no advantage in the committees amalgamating. Whether one accepts that or not, it has pointed out in a memorandum that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effects of the proposed amalgamation are much more subtle and probably unintentional".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS states that one committee is established under statute and the other is not. It points out a problem in relation to vetoes and the different rules under which the committees operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about public expenditure constraints, because, although negotiations are extremely important, I fear that because of falling school rolls pressure might be placed upon representatives to consider that composite classes should be made more acceptable to the teaching profession than they are now. I should make it perfectly clear that composite classes, for non-educational reasons, would not be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with the hon Member. There should be no deterioration in the conditions of service of teachers as outlined in their contracts. But what the hon Member is not saying is how that would be any different if there were either one or two negotiating bodies. Such arguments can be easily put forward whether there is one negotiating body or several.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is outlined in the EIS memorandum, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State's representatives have a virtual power of veto in the salaries committee. They are simply members of the conditions committee which has regard to the Secretary of State's views but is not bound to follow them. Since the Secretary of State is unlikely to relinquish any of his powers in respect of salary negotiation one can only conclude it is his intention to seek a veto position on conditions as well."</p></blockquote>
I think that the Committee would not have had this debate if we were considering the proposition of unifying the two committees in circumstances such as were described by the hon Member for South Ayrshire. If there were to be an expansion of education or indeed circumstances in which there would not be radical structural changes in the numbers and locations of schools, the extension or otherwise of composite classes, changes to secular or Red Book standards, it would have been accepted as entirely reasonable. The problem is that we are being asked to take these decisions at a time when we know that the education system will be squeezed financially and its structure altered dramatically, partly because of the drop in the birth rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have reservations about the proposal if it is correct that the EIS, as one of the bodies closely involved in the day-to-day negotiations as a trade union, believes that the central powers of the Secretary of State would be enhanced by this change and— here is where I introduce my suspicions and doubts about the SED—if, as I suspect, it may be used to worsen the quality of education in Scotland.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
Therefore, we cannot take this decision in abstract or in a vacuum. We all know about the tremendous pressures which will be placed on our educational system. The amalgamation of the two committees may be the equivalent of putting the negotiating side into a kind of iron maiden which will force out of the negotiating system reductions in standards which might impinge upon the education of our children. I have reservations about the proposals which in other circumstances I might not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) was speaking, the Minister intervened about public expenditure cuts in education. It is time the Minister looked at the education system and considered what his cuts mean and what the falling school rolls mean, rather than bandying around meaningless statistics and figures in the typical accountant's manner. Anyone who knows anything about education knows that if school rolls fall it does not follow that expenditure will automatically be cut by a corresponding amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) and I do not often disagree. This is only the second disagreement that we have had during my time in Parliament; I shall not mention the other. The fact is that there is at present one major difference between the committee for conditions of service and the salaries committee. I think that it is true of all the committees. It is certainly true of the conditions of service committees for the colleges of education and the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the salaries committee the Secretary of State, through nomination, is a full member of the management side and therefore essentially has veto powers. When I was involved in negotiations, I always knew that I was talking not to the spokesman on the management side but to the Secretary of State's representative, because he was the bloke who would control the money. But on the conditions of service committee, the Secretary of State was there as an adviser to the management side. There were civil servants there as advisers, but not as full members. That is a very important distinction, and is one of the teachers' main worries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon Friend not accept that he is talking about the current situation, whereas he ought to be talking about what is proposed in the Bill, which is different in that the concordat which now exists between the local authorities and the Secretary of State will fall? My understanding is that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
concordat will fall with the passage of this legislation. What my hon Friend should be worrying about—and I support his amendment on the matter—is subsection (4) of new section 97B, under which the Secretary of State has power to overrule an arbitration. Would not my hon Friend agree that what we are talking about is a totally new situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about a totally new situation; I accept that. Even if the concordat falls and the de jure position alters as a result of this legislation, we all know that the de facto situation will be that on both these committees the Secretary of State will wield enormous power as the person who holds the purse strings. The conditions of service are not entirely related to salaries. Many conditions of service are not related to money. In salary terms the teachers themselves often consider that the Secretary of State is really their employer, because he makes decisions about the money, but the conditions of service—the conditions in school and in the classroom—are matters for the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not claim to know anything about negotiating procedures in the education system, but I know something about procedures in private industry. There is something called the "Confed", which negotiates with the Engineering Employers' Federation. Once the central negotiations have taken place the results go back to the individual companies, and the companies can change or improve on the offer. Some companies are not members of the EEF, and they can negotiate separately. There are parallels in industry in general with the teachers' situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, although I think that my hon Friend will accept that it is not possible to negotiate downwards. A local agreement may go up—wages drift can take place—but there cannot be a downgrading. In other words, an employer who has entered into an agreement cannot then negotiate at a local level for a diminution of wages or salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that as a result of what is proposed there could be a diminution of existing conditions of service, especially in the post-school system, where there are three different sectors, which will not now have any separate bargaining facilities. The Minister did not reply to my points on that issue. It would have been easier for us if he had said that he would examine them because he accepted that there was a problem relating to the operation of three different systems, and that he would therefore consider the incorporation of different machinery. Even though he has not said that, I shall give him the opportunity to do so by seeking to withdraw the amendment to give him time to reconsider the matter and perhaps return to it on Report. If he fails to come back to it then, we shall certainly do so, because it is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party issue—that was made clear by my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire—but a matter of good industrial relations. I believe one thing, my hon Friend believes another, and the Minister believes something slightly different. Therefore, he should hold consultations between now and Report to

	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
see whether a better solution can be reached. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 38, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Any order made under subsection (2) above may be varied or revoked by a subsequent order made by the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 216.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments supplement the existing provisions by providing for the subsequent variation or revocation of an order made under subsection 2 of each of the new sections 91 and 94. Where there is power to make an order by statutory instrument it follows, by virtue of the Interpretation Act 1978, that there is also power to vary or revoke the order subsequently. But when orders are not made by statutory instrument—as those in question would not be—it has to be expressly provided in the enabling legislation that they may be subsequently varied or revoked. The two amendments do this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend ask the Minister to give a more comprehensive explanation without referring to his notes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the words of our former profession, my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and I feel that the Minister may not have "done his homework" on this matter. If he has, he has not explained it to us as clearly as he could, it used to be a trick of pupils who, when they were not sure of what they wanted to say, or when it was not very acceptable, to gabble to try to confuse people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy—perhaps the Minister will go through his remarks again if I did not hear him correctly—because he said that where there was no provision for a resolution of the House to cover the Secretary of State's diktats, he would have the necessary power without the House being able to have a say in the matter. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet that is my impression. It seems to suggest that the Minister is taking on—not necessarily by sleight-of-hand—powers that are greater than the House would normally give to a Minister in this type of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The opposite is true, but I spoke the words as drafted to explain the technicalities of the provision. I am happy to explain the effects of the amendments, which may clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New sections 91(2) and 94(2) empower the Secretary of State to prescribe by order the maximum number of persons by whom respectively the Secretary of State, the teaching staff and education authorities—and additionally, in the case of new section 94(2), governing bodies
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
of colleges of education and of central institutions— may be represented on the two negotiating committees. The amendments provide in each case for the order to be varied or revoked by a subsequent order. The Bill as it stands does not allow for that, and what the hon Gentleman rightly described as the technical jargon with which I introduced the matter was simply to put on record the manner in which the amendments have been drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the orders be subject to positive or negative resolutions of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I think that the Minister is misleading us in trying to slip this through quickly before he shoots off to Scotland. As we thought, the amendment is serious, and we shall have to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can help. Affirmative resolutions are required to be put to, and approved by, the House. The negative resolution procedure allows hon Members to put down a Prayer. Statutory instruments can be subject to a decision of the House in both cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the revocation order or the variation order be of exactly the same type as the initial order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have the same effect and purpose as the initial order. If 1 am wrong, I shall come back to the Committee later, because I have no desire to misinform it. I understood that the position was entirely as you have just told the Committee, Mr. Gourlay—that it would be an order under the negative procedure, and a Prayer against it would provide an opportunity for the Opposition to vote against it. There may be some uncertainty. I may be wrong, but I am grateful that you support me in this, Mr. Gourlay, because I believe that that must be the position. However, if there is anything incorrect in what I have just said, I shall advise the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is struggling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for what has just happened. I believe the position to be as I said initially, as you have confirmed, Mr. Gourlay, and unless that is proved to be incorrect that will remain the position. If I have advised the Committee wrongly, I shall come back at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Would it not be advisable, as the Minister is in such obvious difficulties with his advice, that we should adjourn now and give him a further quarter of an hour to consider the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the suggestion that we should adjourn. In any case, the Chair has given a ruling, and there should be no dubiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Again, the Chair and I have been consistently in agreement. I can now read the note that was given to me, and that, too, agrees with you and with me, so there is no cause for alarm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is no laughing matter. Does not the Minister have briefing meetings with his officials before coming to the Committee, to anticipate some of the questions that will arise? These are natural questions. At our previous sitting, I asked a basic question about who was the registrar of independent schools and the Minister did not know. That is a disgraceful way to treat the Committee. The Minister comes totally unprepared to answer basic questions. The Committee is being treated in a shabby manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only thing shabby about this Committee is the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He should know much better than that. If he has a question that I cannot answer and it has not been answered while I am on my feet, of course I undertake to give him a proper answer later. If I am in doubt as to the answer that I give, of course I shall advise the Committee that I intend to confirm it. No other member of the Committee should do otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, what is of concern to the Committee is the fact that the Opposition did not table the amendment. It is in the names of the two Under-Secretaries. No one should table amendments if he
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
does hot know that he is talking about. For the Minister to say that he does not understand it is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A procedure is suggested similar to that existing with regard to the teachers' salaries award. Instead of a positive resolution, there has to be a negative resolution unless someone puts down a Prayer. The Secretary of State can then make his own decision about wages. That is something that the Minister should have known. It is disgraceful to table an amendment, which is selected by the Chair, without understanding it. It is an insult to you, Mr. Gourlay. You selected the amendment in good faith, and now we find that the Minister has no brief and cannot understand his own amendment. It is a disgrace and an insult to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister is clear yet in. his own mind, and he has certainly caused considerable confusion in the Committee. May I ask him a few simple questions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the initial order were subject to positive approval of the House, must the revocation or variation order also be subject to positive approval of the House, or could it be subject to negative approval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we have just said: the variation will be subject to negative approval of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear, Mr. Gourlay, that you have rightly grouped the amendments because they cover the same clause, but that they are very different in their intention. As usual, the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and I have different objectives. His amendment suggests that the Secretary of State's powers should be increased, whereas I seek to have them decreased. The clause says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A nomination shall not be invited under subsection (3)(a)(ii) above unless and until such invitation is approved by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
If a majority of the members of an education authority agree, they can invite another body—presumably one representing employers—on to the committee. I suggest that it is perfectly legitimate to decide who the employers are and who should represent them on the committee. It should not be left to the Secretary of State to choose members in the first place—but we have debated that. However, once they have been chosen, even if that has to be by the Secretary of State, he should not have the right to tell employers "You have chosen a certain body of people to represent you on the committee, but I do not want them on it." It will be a committee of employers and employees to negotiate salaries—and, unfortunately, conditions of service of teachers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it should be a matter for employers to decide whom they will have. I accept that the Secretary of State has to be part of that process, because it is his responsibility to nominate his representatives. That is quite clear, and 1 have made no attempt to amend that part of the Bill, but when it comes to who should represent the employers, that should be a job for the employers, as is the case with trade unions. It has
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
nothing to do with the Secretary of State, and, therefore, he should not be entitled to have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a simple point, and I should have thought that the Minister would agree with me about it, because on several other occasions during the passage of the Bill he has made great play of the fact that he is trying to transfer present powers from the Secretary of State to the local authorities. The Minister has the opportunity to be, for once, consistent during the passage of the Bill. He can accept the amendment to take that provision out of the Bill altogether and ensure that the local authorities can decide for themselves which organisations shall be represented on the Committee and that the Secretary of State shall have no say after the first instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to the four amendments in my name which are in two pairs. Amendments Nos. 167 aod 165 relate to the school negotiating committee, and amendments Nos. 169 and 166 relate to the further education committee. They are parallel amendments, and it does not much matter which I deal with, because the same case can be argued for both pairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic problem that I wish to deal with arises from the teaching staff membership of the negotiating committees. In a way, the problem is mirrored in both committees because of what could happen with the Bill as it stands. I am putting forward an argument in respect of the school negotiating committee, and although I could put forward the same argument in respect of further education committee I shall not do so, because that would simply duplicate the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new section 92(3)(") states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the members of the committee for the time being representing—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) teaching staff may from time to time, if a majority of those members so agree, invite a body (whether or not a body by which one or more of those members was nominated) which appears to them to be representative of teaching staff … to nominate a person to membership of the committee".</p></blockquote>
In other words, if the staff side vote that somebody should be added to the committee, that can be done. However, they could then come up— I emphasise that this is a "could" argument—against subsection (6), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a maximum prescribed … be exceeded".</p></blockquote>
I believe that one would logically assume that it would be exceeded in that case, and if a majority of the members of the staff side agree they can vote somebody off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it would happen, but there is a danger that the largest union on the teachers' side, or an amalgamation of unions in the case of the further education committee, could decide to vote one of its members on, and, because the maximum number was exceeded, to vote another union's member off. I do not believe that that would ever happen, but it is a little dangerous to enact legislation in which that power would be incorporated. Therefore, I believe that my hon Friend should consider that matter because it would not be fair or democratic for that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the differing numbers in unions, there may come a day when the composition, in all justice and fairness, ought to be changed. I believe that that could be done with the approval of the Secretary of State. As the employers' side can do exactly the same thing under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
the same subsection, but with the addition in both cases that if a member is added and a member is taken off the approval of the Secretary of State is needed, my amendments suggest that that same approval should apply to the teachers' side as well, so that the danger which I envisaged should not occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
