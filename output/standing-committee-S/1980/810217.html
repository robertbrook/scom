	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. There was some discussion at the start of our last sitting about whether we should sit this afternoon. I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity to consider his position, but I think that there will be general anxiety on both sides of .the Committee. I am sure that the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), for example, would give it a very high priority to be in attendance in .the House during the debate on the Linwood closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that hon Members on both sides will foe anxious to be in the House for that debate, which I understand will last until about 7 pm. It is my intention to move that the Committee should not sit during that period. But as for whether it might be appropriate to sit after that time, perhaps we can decide that later this morning. I fully appreciate that hon Members will be anxious to avoid that if possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like a nice bit of blackmail being set up in his usual civilised fashion by the Under-Secretary. I speak without having consulted my hon Friends, but I am sure that we are as one in thinking that a sitting after 7 pm would be regarded as a visitation of the plague. I hope that the Minister will not try to enforce that upon us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not regard the Minister's comment as helpful. No one in the Committee has been difficult, despite the fact that one or two of us have the experience to foe difficult. If the hon Gentleman does not accept in good faith the representations that have been made because of the Linwood debate, the Committee will last longer than he expects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman did not listen to what I said, or perhaps I failed to make the position clear. There is no question of the Committee sitting for the duration of the debate on the Floor of the House on Linwood. I am happy to reassure the hon Gentleman on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly the usual channels and the usual method of consultation will be in operation during the (morning.

	<div class='title'>POWERS OF COMMISSIONER FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [12 February],</i> No. 48, in page 14, line 10, insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>bb</i>) In section 24 (Complaints not to be entertained regarding anything done before 16th May 1975) there shall be inserted after 'date' the words 'provided that the Commissioner may conduct an investigation if satisfied that in the particular circumstances it would be reasonable to do so.'."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>—[Mr. Allan Stewart.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were engaged on Thursday in giving a warm welcome to a rare phenomenon in the Committee, an amendment in the name of a Conservative hon Member. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, Bast (Mr. Stewart) is to be congratulated on his bravery in breaking ranks in this way and coming forward with a practical proposal. It was a little disappointing to discover that it was not one of general principle, but was based upon a constituency case. However, we must foe thankful for small offerings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was expressing some anxiety about the difficulties outlined by the Minister. He had argued that one was that it presupposed the investigation on a discretionary basis of an alleged maladministration which took place under the aegis of the local authority prior to the local government reorganisation of 1975. The Minister went on to argue that that would be difficult, because although there was a moral obligation—and no more—on a local authority to take action as the local government Commissioner suggested, that moral obligation would be much weakened if the original sin was the responsibility of, say, a county council that predated the regional council or the district council which was now the successor authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the force of that argument, but I am not entirely convinced by it. I should have thought that most local government units would accept that they were responsible to a large extent for the actings of their predecessors and that there was an element of continuity. Obviously, the further back the incident being investigated, the more difficult it is to get to the root of the trouble. People will have retired, people will have died, the files may even have been pulped. If the material to reach a conclusion does not exist, there will not be this difficulty, because there will be no recommendation. There will be a decision not to investigate or the investigation will be abortive. But if the Ombudsman comes to a firm conclusion that remedial action is necessary, the Minister is being a little uncharitable in suggesting that that is a moral obligation that will not be accepted by the successor authority, or that there is a danger that it will not be accepted by the successor authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that the further back one goes, the more difficult it is to carry the matter through
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>495</span>
successfully, but I still believe that an element of flexibility is, on the whole, advantageous in a system of this kind. As the amendment is entirely discretionary, and as the Ombudsman is someone who I presume can be trusted to exercise discretion, if he is invited to look into something which in local government terms is equivalent to medieval times, presumably he will just say "I shall not exercise my discretion." But there may be a matter that started in the early 1970s but has had a continuing impact. This may parallel actions of reparation, where the law has recognised that there can be difficulties with latent medical results of a certain incident, and that there can be an unexpected development, which has been lying latent, after the complainer has gone beyond the triennium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975 something might happen, such as a good solid piece of ground being bought—an example given by the hon Member—with the disastrous consequences, a house disappearing down a mineshaft, or whatever it may be, not becoming apparent until many years later. In those exceptional circumstances, it might be fair to exercise a discretion, and there might well be good records of the transaction in the legal department and in the titles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am predisposed towards the amendment in terms of leaving the matter as an open discretion to be exercised by the Ombudsman. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to look at it a little more sympathetically and that he will give his blessing to what is a very modest suggestion. If the hon Member is disposed to force the issue, I think that he will find at least a fair measure of sympathy on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises some fundamental questions. Although the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) moved it in a characteristically modest manner, there is a fundamental principle behind it. We should have a little more information, so that we can make up our minds whether to support the amendment, because I presume that the hon Member will press it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have thought that the proposal would shatter the whole organisation. The Commissioner deals with, at most, a couple of hundred cases a year. I have not made any analysis of the time spent on any particular case, but I think that to leave discretion is not world-shattering, though there is a principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned because the hon Member gave us no details of the grounds for saying that justice was not being obtained. I am sure that it is a serious amendment, but is it maladministration, or has that not been proved in the mind of the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East? If there are cases like this— and here is a practical example—we should pursue the matter and obtain more information from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can fully understand the reasons why, in respect of the constituency he has to deal with, my hon Friend feels that such an amendment would be an improvement."</p></blockquote>
What did he mean by that? Is it because it is in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
Strathclyde, because it is in Eastwood or because it is part of Renfrew district council? Which is the offending authority? What is the significance of that rather cryptic remark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a slight error for which the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter or the printer may have been responsible. As I recollect it, I said: "in respect of the constituency case he has to deal with." My hon Friend had raised a particular constituency case which had led to the tabling of the amendment, as can clearly be seen from my hon Friend's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but the Minister has staff at his disposal to make sure that his speeches are reported correctly. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local authority that would have been responsible for the maladministration had ceased to exist, is not able to be approached to rectify the problem. Therefore, there would be difficulty for successor authorities in dealing with the matter."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand the validity of that argument. Surely it must be written into statute somewhere that the successor authorities accept the assets, liabilities and responsibilities of previous authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that a degree of confidentiality is involved, and I do not suggest that the hon Gentleman should divulge anything of that kind. But let us suppose that Renfrew county council had flogged off a bit of ground. Did it know that it was faulty or was it also the planning authority that gave consent for the building of a house on top of a pit-shaft? I exaggerate but, if that were the case, clearly there would have been some maladministration. I should have thought, in my simple layman's mind, that the successor authority for that particular function, whatever authority it might be, would have to accept some responsibility in any case for damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar) is the legal expert on this kind of thing. The point that he made about his pension and the successor authority to Lanark county council being Strathclyde is relevant. If the authority is known, as clearly it must be, that sold the land and subsequently gave planning permission, is there some degree of maladministration in these circumstances, in that it was known, or reasonable to assume, that the authority should know something of the grounds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have personal knowledge of the case of an ex-constituent. It was in the Falkirk-Stirling area, so I am not giving away a confidence. He was a young man setting up home and building a house for himself. He had enormous legal difficulties and financial problems because of this very thing. So it is an important amendment in my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to say that the Commissioner
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not absolutely precluded from looking at anything that happened before the date in question."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 February 1981; 	<i>c.</i> 488–89.]</p></blockquote>
That date is May 1975. If he is not precluded from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
looking at what has happened, why is the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East having difficulty in getting this looked at, or has it been looked at and is someone passing the buck as to whether there is any liability? That usually means that there is a possible claim, and everybody clams up. The Minister needs to elaborate a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we must assume in advance that, in the vast majority of cases, the Commissioner would not feel able to exercise his discretion for exactly the sort of reasons that I have indicated, it would be giving the appearance of a change without the reality. It might create far more disappointment than the existing situation. So, for these reasons, I hope that my hon Friend will not press the amendment."</p></blockquote>
We all accept that to raise false hopes in any circumstances is irresponsible. Hon Members will accept that I am not guilty of that. I find it hard to believe that masses of people in Provan, or indeed any area, believe that they suffer from maladministration by local authorities. The vast majority of them do not think that they suffer from maladministration. I do not think that if we accepted an amendment giving the Commissioner discretion I would be flooded with people wanting something. I have not sent anything to the Ombudsman at local or national level yet, so I do not expect to be flooded out if this amendment is accepted. The Minister finally said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not legally obligatory on the authority to do so, but if it were the authority that was responsible for the maladministration it would normally feel a moral obligation so to act."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 February 1981; c. 488-90.]</p></blockquote>
We are discussing not the schedule but an amendment which deals only with section 24 of the original Act, but that the schedule itself has some important changes to make in the procedure that the Commissioner will operate under, so we shall want to spend a fair amount of time later examining all the changes involved in this schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a major local government Bill. It is not simply about changes in rating, or about housing support grant, or attacks on Lothian region, it is an opportunity—which indeed the Government have taken—of making all sorts of changes in important aspects of local government in Scotland. This amendment, which is the first sign of real life from the Government Benches, deserves a considerable debate, and that is why I am encouraging the hon Member to give us more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment encourages the extension of the responsibilities of the Commissioner and, indeed, still leaves discretion. What effect, if any, will the Stodart committee have on this? I think that I would be right in assuming that the committee will require legislation if there is to be a statutory responsibility placed on one authority as against its being placed on two authorities—the concurrent function element— at present. Does that mean that we shall have an additional local government Bill which will raise more or less the same issues of principle as the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ombudsman's annual report is relevant. In paragraph 4 it refers to appendix 3, giving an analysis of the reasons why 165 complaints were not accepted for investigation during the year. May we have some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
information on whether these 165 might have included the case raised by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I have not had time to do my homework. In appendix 3 there are about eight references to section 24 and the various subsections under which the analysis of complaints not accepted has been given. I have great regard for the work done by the hon Member. I know that he does his homework. I hear him on Radio Clyde on Sunday morning regularly, well briefed as the Government apologist. He is the natural heir or successor to the now hon Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor). I take that back. The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) would feel offended if I did not award him that title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the matter can only come under section 24(10), which refers to a discretionary decision not to investigate. Is the discretion there an inherent or basic discretion, or is that the exercise of a discretion because something it is claimed happened before 1975? We are dealing here with 51 cases, presumably received in a year. That does not seem an inordinate burden. I do not know. I have not had time to look up section 24(10). I assume that it is the discretionary decision not to investigate. That is precisely what the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East seems to be inquiring about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a brief comment on how I regard the importance of the schedule. Certainly it is a very interesting preamble to the discussion on the schedule that the hon Member has raised such a fundamental matter. I hope that he will enlighten us with more information, and equally that the Minister will reply at some length to the various relevant and pertinent points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest my hon Friend the Minister thinks that I shall take up an undue amount of time on the amendment, may I say that I only briefly take up the point raised by the amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I recognise that there is a danger in arguing from the particular to the general on this, I think that I am one ahead of the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), in that I have been involved in one case which has been to the local government Ombudsman. That was over a golf course at Carnoustie, where an attempt has been made to increase it from just the one championship course to an additional course. Since 1975 certain actions have been taken by the district council which have excited local opposition, and reference was made to the local government Ombudsman. He reached a number of conclusions, one of which was critical of the district council. His report on matters that occurred from 1975 was in every respect, I would have considered, satisfactory, whether from the standpoint of the district council or of those local residents who objected to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that that was a matter which had been locally under discussion by the old town council in Carnoustie for at least 10 years before 1975. As the Minister has said, the Ombudsman was not absolutely precluded from looking at anything that happened before May 1975, but in the report in its totality there was something of an imbalance. All that he felt able to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
do was to narrate in the broadcast factual fashion what had occurred up to the reorganisation of local government. Once it got to that date he continued to narrate factually and then commented upon it. It seems to me that where there is an activity like this which has been continuing for a considerable period it would be of better balance and better value to those who are concerned if he felt freer—though possibly not going as far as my hon Friend would like—to comment upon activities and actions of local government prior to that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I would go so far as to say that the Ombudsman should be in a position to look into, say, an act of maladministration occurring back in the 1960s, but he should do so where there has been a continuing course of local government activity which has a direct bearing on the complaint coming after 1975. Whether that requires a statutory base, I do not know, but I should like him to look at it more broadly than he has done hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure, Mr. Gourlay, that this is a matter close to your heart—the future of championship golf courses in Scotland. I think that Carnoustie is one of the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member has not indicated where the maladministration occurred. This is the crux of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member said that there had been a subject under discussion and that there had been local argument and discussion. Where is the maladministration? It is only on that basis that I would support an amendment that the Ombudsman should investigate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to elaborate too much on that, but I take the hon Gentleman's point. The maladministration was that, although the land was apparently under the authority's control, in setting up the golf course on part of it, it had not treated it as a matter requiring planning permission. Curiously enough, the particular item on which it failed to secure planning permission was the construction of bunkers. It would have been a curious links course if it had proceeded without a single bunker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have been very popular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly have made a very interesting contrast to the championship course, which is renowned for its bunkers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that the situation of the bunkers and the particular part of the course that fell into public ownership had all been part and parcel of early design consideration going back anything up to 10 years. It would have provided a far more balanced report if this had all been narrated and the comment made that this was where the local authority, first in its old form as the town council and now as the district council, began to be misled. If the Ombudsman had just said that and a little more, that would have been sufficient. I am arguing for him not to have power to go back into the mists of antiquity in local government administration but just to take a broader view of what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that he will press it, because he is gathering support all the time. That may have something to do with his appearances on Radio Clyde. I, too, am a great enthusiast for his appearances on Radio Clyde. I think that it has something to do with the fact that he is the only known living Tory Member in the vicinity of Glasgow. There is another, but any claim as to his existence is as dubious as that of the yeti; one hopes that more substantial evidence will present itself to the House at an early date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have not heard why the Government cannot accept the amendment. The suggestion has been made that it would open up difficulties for the successor authorities following the last reorganisation of local government, that previous authorities no longer exist and therefore they cannot be held accountable for anything they did at that time. I accept that there are practical difficulties. As someone born in the city of Aberdeen, I would not expect to be able to take the matter of the local authority of Aberdeen that bankrupted itself in the House of Lords action against the Gordon Highlanders in, I think, the seventeenth century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be possible to go as far back as that. As the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East pointed out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amendment would not open up the whole general area of action before 1975 to investigation by the Commissioner, because there are a number of limitations in the 1975 Act. It would simply give the Commissioner the discretion, in a few exceptional cases, to take up complaints about maladministration before 1975 which had become obvious only after 1975." [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 February 1981; c. 488.]</p></blockquote>
That is a powerful point. It is exactly the point that persuades me that the hon Gentleman has made a good case for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Unlike my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) and the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), I have had many cases referred to three Ombudsmen—the parliamentary Ombudsman and the Ombudsmen for local administration and for the Health Services. It is an arrangement which I use frequently. I try to persuade my constituents that it is a last resort open to them. It is often pointed out to me by the Commissioners that a case does not fit the criteria. Nevertheless, it is an avenue that can be explored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, in the analysis of complaints set out in appendix 3 of the Commissioner's annual report for the year ended 31 March 1980, it is interesting to note that no case was rejected on the criterion offered by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East. No case last year fell within the category that his amendment seeks to introduce into the terms of the remit of the Commission for Local Administration. Therefore, it does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
not seem to me that we are opening up massive difficulties for the handful of people who run the Commissioner's office. In fact, there are 11 people on the staff, and we shall not overburden them with work if we introduce another area of discretion for the Commissioner. The number of cases would be few and far between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may not meet the high standards demanded by parliamentary draftsmen. Perhaps there is a flaw in it. If so, no doubt the Minister will latch on to it. But the general intention of the amendment is sound, and has my support. There is no need for the local authorities to fear that it will present them with serious difficulties because they are the successor authorities and not responsible for what happened under their predecessors. I do not like that argument. It smacks of those companies that one hears about on Roger Cook's radio programme. I think it is on a Tuesday morning—that is the day I normally get up late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are two days in a great lifetime? This reminds me of those companies that vanish overnight. They receive a telephone call from the BBC asking "Are you Messrs So-and-so who used to deal in motor cars?" They reply "No. We have absolutely nothing to do with them. We deal in bicycles." They have vanished and become something else overnight. It would be monstrous if we were to say that our local authorities could behave in that way. Indeed, they would not choose to. There were, of course, transitional arrangements in the Local Government (Scotland) Act which took care of the situation in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our immediate concern is for individuals who have a complaint against local authorities. If that complaint has become apparent only in recent time—and it is in matters of planning that it will be most readily apparent—some years after the decision has been made by a previous local authority, there has to be some redress. There must be some protection for individuals who may be the casualties of actions by large organisations such as local authorities. It is in their interest and for their protection that the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East has moved his amendment, and he is to be commended for it. He will have my support, and I am sure that of my hon Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful if I responded at this stage. I understand that there have been certain discussions, and I am happy now to give an assurance that it is not my intention to ask the Committee to sit again today after 1 pm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In responding to the specific matters raised in this interesting debate, may I make first a point which I think is of great substance. This is not a new matter to be considered by Parliament. It was considered when the original Act setting up the Ombudsman was put through by the Labour Government in 1975. What hon Gentlemen in their enthusiasm about the provisions of my hon Friend's amendment seem to have overlooked is that the Labour Administration came to the view that even in 1975 it would be inappropriate to ask the Ombudsman to look at maladministration that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
took place before 1975. If they were able to come to that decision, with the powerful arguments that I used on Thursday—which must have been more powerful in 1975—that factor has to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves why the Labour Government in 1975 did not feel it appropriate that the Ombudsman should consider maladministration that took place even a few months or a year before, even two years before, at a time when to do so would obviously have been, from an administrative point of view, much easier, because the individuals would be likely still to be around, they would be likely to be in similar offices and the problems of tracing documents and so forth would be that much easier. Yet even at that time it was thought inappropriate to go back beyond the reorganisation of local government, largely for the reasons that I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not here on Thursday, but I read very carefully the Minister's remarks, and I took the opportunity this morning to consult my hon Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) who was on the staff of the English local government Ombudsman. He informed me that the English local government Ombudsman was set up on 1 January 1974, so I imagine that the blame—if that is the correct expression—that can be attributed to the Labour Government for their failure to afford powers of retrospection in this sense can also be attributed to the last Conservative Administration. That is no reason why the present one should necessarily carry on the sins of past generations. There is an opportunity for the Minister to be innovatory and to break away from the cavillings and the constraints of English law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has confirmed my point, though no doubt he did not intend to, because the fact that that date was used in England and Wales happens to be because English reorganisation of local government took place on that date. Therefore, it would appear that in England and in Scotland Governments of various political complexions did the same. We are dealing with the 1975 Act passed by the Labour Administration, and the important point—I accept that it is not a party point—is that if even at the time local government reorganisation took place, and the Ombudsman was being established, it was thought that it was inappropriate and unwise, for all the reasons which convinced Parliament at that time, to allow a whole matter to be reopened that took place prior to the initial date of the Ombudsman's responsibility, then to suggest that six years later the arguments are anything other than far more powerful strains one's credulity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can do better than that. I hope that he has not exhausted himself commenting on Jimmy Boyle excessively. It is a poor argument to refer to a new scheme, the use of which no one could have assessed. I agree with the Minister that it is not a party point, because some of it was done by a Conservative Government and some by a Labour Government. A new scheme was introduced and no one had the slightest idea, other than on the basis of experience in other countries, what the demand might be or what use might be made of it. It is perfectly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
natural to say "We are starting as from now, and we shall investigate maladministration in the future, with the proviso of discretion to go back the other way." It is all the more relevant now that we have the information and we know that we are not dealing with a policy of going back into the dim and distant past. The Minister can do better than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly believe it is a perfectly valid argument. The reason it obviously attracted the Government and Parliament of the day was that, partly because of reorganisation, substantial administrative problems were created, but more importantly, if that date was not used, some other date had to be chosen or it had to be left completely open-ended. If it was left completely open-ended one was into the farce of giving to the public the expectation that any maladministration, whenever it happened, at any time in the past, could be the subject of consideration by the Ombudsman, although in practice, in 99 cases out of 100, or 999 cases out of 1,000, he would have to decline to investigate the matter, because it was inappropriate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to raise public expectations of a possible remedy which one knows in advance will not be available in the vast majority of cases. That, I have no doubt, is one of the reasons why the Commissioner at present takes the view that this sort of change would not be appropriate. It is not an extra power that he would like to have. It is not an amendment which he himself believes to be advisable or desirable in the light of his own experience. Surely, the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), who is a very fair man, will accept that the Commissioner himself is the man with the greatest experience of the workings of this particular requirement. The fact that he does not feel that such a change would be appropriate is a perfectly relevant and very important point, which the Committee should bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an additional factor, which has been overlooked in the debate up to now, but which I think is of importance. Hon Members should refer to section 24(4) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975, where they will see that, unless there are special circumstances to the contrary:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A complaint shall not be entertained unless it was made to a member of the authority concerned within twelve months from the day on which the person aggrieved first had notice of the matters alleged in the complaint".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we are not dealing simply with a situation in which for one reason or another the potentially aggrieved party has delayed raising the matter. For any of this discretion to be available, in all normal circumstances there would have to be a situation in which the cause of the aggrievement took place before 1975 but the member of the public concerned did not become aware of that until five or six years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an unlikely set of circumstances. Now it is suggested that we add to it the requirement that even if these conditions were met the Commissioner would be able to intervene only in the very rare circumstances where a full investigation could still be made of matters which took place under local authorities which no longer exist, of a maladministration which was at least more than six years old and possibly many more years
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
old, and where all the information and recollections were sufficiently available to allow a considered judgment to be made. That combination of circumstances is so unlikely as to suggest that if a change of this kind were to be made its effect would be meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Parliament can always do these things because it can be argued that it would not do any harm, but the important point is that it would be creating expectations. Hon Gentlemen are aware that Members of Parliament often have requests from constituents who are aggrieved about matters which happened years ago. If, on the fact of it, these are matters which could be examined, they would have to be referred to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would then have to make investigations as to whether he could use his discretion. That is a complicated and, I believe, unnecessary introduction into the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is an argument, having regard to appendix 3. Of the cases that the Ombudsman rejected, not one came within the category proposed in the amendment. Why does the Minister believe that it would be a problem, when there is not the slightest evidence that even one case has come forward? We know that one exists in East Renfrewshire, but not one has been reported to the Commissioner so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no gap in the existing law which is creating any great problems for the community as a whole. If the Commissioner could say that he was continually getting requests for him to act to which he would like to be able to respond, but which he has had to refuse to respond to because of the existing state of the law, that would be evidence of a gap in the law which the Committee should consider filling. But the hon Gentleman has confirmed that there is no significant problem, that we are aware of, or cases which the Commissioner would have liked to be able to investigate if he had the discretion to do so. As I have indicated, the Commissioner does not believe that such a change would be desirable, and he has therefore not recommended that such a change should be supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great care to my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). He said that there might well be cases of maladministration that had taken place since 1975 but in which there might be circumstances relevant to that maladministration which arose before 1975. The Commissioner has a general power to look at incidental matters that arose before 1975, but I accept that there may be insufficient precision as to the extent of his discretion in that respect. I should be happy to consider further whether some changes might be made to make more specific the right of the Commissioner to look at evidence which arose before 1975, but which may be important in considering whether maladministration alleged since 1975 actually took place. I accept that the powers available to him now may appear to be rather circumscribed and rigid, and I shall therefore consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, of course, give further thought to the whole basic question of my hon Friend's amendment. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
appreciate the strength of feeling expressed by hon Gentlemen. I am not able to agree to it at the moment, but I undertake to have further discussion with the Commissioner as to whether the change would be appropriate. But I have to say that no evidence that my hon Friend or the Committee has available at the moment suggests that there is any significant problem in terms of the number who could benefit from such a change. Nor is there evidence that the exercise of such a discretion would amount to anything other than a cosmetic change in the legislation which would be of little benefit to the community as a whole. But, recognising the feeling in the Committee, I shall consider the matter further, if that is the Committee's desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by my hon Friend the Member for South Angus about making it more explicit that evidence arising before 1975 should be considered in a case of alleged maladministration since 1975,1 can see that there may well be a good argument for some change, and I shall give specific consideration to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to follow up what the Minister has said. He implied that maladministration took place at an instant in time and that it might have taken place before May 1975 or after that date. I have a case which I should like him to take account of in his discussion with the Ombudsman—I think that there are others; certainly the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) referred to such a case—in which the aggravation arises not from a single event, such as the refusal to offer a particular house, but from procrastination over a period by the previous local authority and the current local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pursuing the case that I have in mind with the Kyle and Carrick district council, but if it does not solve it satisfactorily it might be referred to the Ombudsman. But I am not clear whether he would have the power to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case concerns the compulsory purchase of a building before 1975. No compensation has yet been given, because there has been a major dispute about the level of compensation before and after reorganisation. Interestingly enough, in most cases it is the same officials who have dealt with this prior to reorganisation in Girvan town council and subsequently in Kyle and Carrick district council. At least some of the officials are the same, although I concede that new officials are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Gentlemen were talking about planning examples. Here in a Committee of 17 three examples have come to light of things which are not specific aggravations at a point in time, as the Minister implied, but there is long-term procrastination and delay in obtaining a satisfactory solution to something that started prior to reorganisation and that has not been dealt with subsequently. Does the Minister consider that such cases could be referred to the Ombudsman, and that he could deal with them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some of the alleged maladministration was subsequent to reorganisation, the prime act which started the whole thing off, the compulsory acquisition of the building in Girvan at the time when there was a comprehensive development area proposal, took place prior to reorganisation. I am at a loss to know whether,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
under the present provision, such a matter could be raised. I favour the amendment, because it seems to me that it would help in the kind of case that I have just mentioned and that other hon Gentlemen have also mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a worthwhile and useful debate. It has enabled the Minister to retrieve the situation by referring to the relevant sections of the Act. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) has possibly, as I did, overlooked the 12-month period. He did not mention it, and it seems to me that that is probably more relevant to most cases. I agree with the Minister. The last thing I want to do is to raise false hopes. Therefore, that to me is a real safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) it is still not clear to me what the injustice was about the Carnoustie golf course. I presume that it is against an individual or individuals, and if they have known about this for the last 10 years, under a dynamic authority such as Carnoustie, surely they would be debarred because of this 12-month period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a very useful discussion. I do not think that the amendment would mean that the Commissioner would be overburdened with complaints. The Minister has given some assurances in general. He has given no assurance about reviewing the 12-month period in section 24(4). I am not suggesting that he should do so. But in the debate on the schedule we shall examine the work of the Commissioner as a whole, in the light of the representations that he has made for changes in legislation. I wonder whether there is any possibility of our being required to look at how the 12-month rule is working. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East might like to address his mind to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the only member of the Ombudsman Committee on this Committee, so I feel that it is probably relevant that I should make some comments. I had not intended to do so. But in the Committee we have looked from time to time at matters affecting the period before local government reorganisation. One aspect that has always interested us is the fact that it is difficult enough now to get some authorities even after maladministration has been proven, to take rectifying action. I believe that it would be even more difficult with an administration that no longer existed. That is one of the reasons why 1 have some doubts, although my heart is with the amendment. There are problems in trying to get the public to feel that in some way their injustice has been dealt with properly. I think that that is really what this is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon Gentleman is a man of great experience, and an expert on almost every subject, but what Committee is he on which gives him the expertise in this subject?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert. I am a member of the Select Committee for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and the Local Government Commissioner for Administration.

What my hon Friend the Under-Secretary said was

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
most encouraging. I believe that the other members of the Committee will be pleased to hear that the Government are prepared to look at this matter in a helpful and constructive way, because we have been considering it for some time and I hope that we shall have more flexible rules on the way in which we can approach problems of this kind. It is recognised on the Select Committee that the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Local Government Commissioner are the very last officials that people who feel aggrieved can come to. The amendment has been very useful, because it has highlighted the fact that this is an area which perhaps the Government should look at a little more carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and constructive debate on the amendment, with Members on both sides contributing in a constructive way. That is a tribute to the importance of the local government Ombudsman. It also shows that the amendment has highlighted a genuine problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the personal congratulations from the hon Members for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) on what one of them described as the rare phenomenon of a Government Back Bencher moving an amendment. I have a bit of news for them—I do not know whether they will regard it as good or bad. 1 have one other amendment and two clauses on the Amendment Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the constructive things which has come out of the debate is the response of my hon Friend the Under-Secretary to my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), his clear undertaking to look at this particular point about where evidence has arisen before 1975 and over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm to the hon Member for Provan that this is a serious amendment. I am in some difficulty in responding to his request that I should explain more fully the background to the constituency case that brought this matter to my attention. It is clear to me that it would have been very useful to my constituent if it had been possible to put the case to the Ombudsman, because he felt there was maladministration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Provan referred to the 12-month rule under section 24(4) of the 1975 Act. It is true that I did not specifically refer to that in moving the amendment, but when I said
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are a number of limitations in the 1975 Act" [	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 February 1981; 	<i>c.</i> 488]</p></blockquote>
it was the 12-month rule that I had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are problems of principle and that there are problems of practicality, which my hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) referred to. I accept also that the Commissioner himself does not want the new power that is proposed. In the light of the clear assurance that I have received from my hon Friend the Minister that there will be discussions between the Government and the Commissioner, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As has been instanced by the little debate on the amendment, there is a considerable amount of interest in the working of the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland. Most of my hon Friends, and I am sure other members of the Committee, have taken the trouble to look at the latest annual report and to give some thought not only to the changes in schedule 1, but perhaps to the basis on which they have been picked and exactly what the implications are. It is not very often that we have the opportunity to consider amendments to a scheme in this way. Local government miscellaneous provisions Acts are, perhaps mercifully, rare occurrences. They provide a useful opportunity for the Government to revise schemes which we all support in outline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt at all that everyone of us is a supporter of the concept of the local government Ombudsman and all of us would like to see the scheme working efficiently as a court of last recourse. When interventions by elected members have failed, and there is a continuing dispute between a constituent and a local authority which involves allegations of maladministration, it is extremely useful to have an impartial outsider who has the power to move in to try to reach the basis of the argument, and to come up with a considered judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one or two minor questions which the Under-Secretary can deal with fairly easily. We have a proposal which is almost typographical. The provisions of section 22(2) of the 1975 Act are being imported into section 21(4). I do not make any objection to that, though I am a little curious as to why it has been done. I presume it is just for ease of comprehension, and does not involve anything more sinister or subtle than that. That particular provision, as the Committee will remember, deals with the necessity to arrange for the publication of the local government commissioner's report. As far as I can see, the last report we have had is the one dealing with the year which ended on 31 March 1979, and the report was dated 14 June 1979. I should have thought that by now we would have been favoured with the report for the year to 31 March 1980.1 do not know if that has yet been published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was published last July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely interesting, because if I may say so, Mr. McCartney, the most careful scrutiny of the indexes in the Library—not by me which would be a very fallible process—but by the staff of the Library, has not produced this. I shall certainly draw it to their attention. It is very seldom that they are fallible in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had at the back of my mind the totally unworthy suggestion that this report had been lost in the same way as the more recent criminal statistics have been lost. That is another matter of some interest to me, because we are very far behind in that particular area, but it would not be relevant to go into that at any length at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased indeed that we have the more up-to-date report. My own remarks, unfortunately, are largely confined to the 1979 report. The general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
point of principle I want to raise still holds good, and I therefore have no intention of giving ground upon it. Why did the Minister think it worthwhile to bring in the proposal that a finding of the local government Ombudsman should not only be available for inspection for the taking of copies but should also be available for sale at a reasonable charge? It seems to me a remarkably pettifogging little change, which hardly justifies the trouble of writing it into schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen a number of Ombudsman reports involving constituents. They are comparatively short reports and I would have thought that to sell them was a little excessive. While I recognise the zeal of the Under-Secretary to recover any few pennies of revenue which may be possible, it seems to me rather an extraordinary introduction. Presumably the money goes to the local authority, not to the Ombudsman, but the Minister might just clarify that point. I presume that it is to cover the costs of photostating the individual report, because we are dealing here with the report into an individual complaint and not the general report for the year's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important point I wanted to make is an omission rather than something that is in the schedule. In debates on the amendment of the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), the Minister has made fairly copious references to the fact that when the Ombudsman makes a finding which suggests specific remedial action, we are dealing with a moral obligation on the local authority. I am not talking about the successor authority but about the actual authority which may have been responsible throughout the incident. There is only a moral obligation on that authority to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a further step can follow for the Ombudsman, in the sense that under section 29 of the 1975 Act he can issue a further report, which is the equivalent of an admonitory finger-wagging by him, drawing attention to the local authority's failure to carry out the suggested steps to put right the wrong which, in his view, has been committed. But there is no doubt that if the report under section 29 also falls on stony ground, that is the end of the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what has happened in the last year. As I say, I am somewhat handicapped—I am looking at the 1979 report. But it is still relevant to do so, because paragraph 2 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Elsewhere in this report concern is expressed about the statutory means for ensuring that satisfactory remedies are adopted by the authorities in cases of maladministration. This has not become a serious problem in Scotland so far, but danger signs are appearing and I am bringing the matter to attention in the hope that a difficult situation can be avoided."</p></blockquote>
He goes on in paragraph 7 to elaborate on that point and to express his worries. In the last sentence, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My earlier remarks about the need for co-operation by the authorities apply to this situation and it is with reluctance that I find myself having to consider the issue of a second report in some of these cases."</p></blockquote>
These are just the seeds of doubt in the mind of the Ombudsman, and most authorities may be anxious to make amends and to carry out the burden of the reports. I certainly hope so. If the Ombudsman has examined the situation and come up with specific recommendations, it would be a brave local authority, or a particularly obtuse one, which would be prepared to pay no attention to that report or to a subsequent report issued under section 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
Certainly in the year ended 31 March 1979—as far as I know there has been no statutory change in the situation—that was a worry at the back of the Ombudsman's mind, a worry significant enough to be given prominence in that report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon Friend is aware of the case at present before Edinburgh district council. A Mr. Walter Gunkel has had a complaint against Edinburgh distriet council in respect of sewage and drainage and various problems which have arisen. It appears that the man has no means of redress because the local authority, admittedly a hard-faced Tory authority which is notably unsympathetic to the needs of its ratepayers, has chosen to ignore his complaint— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is a most regrettable situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am. I may say that the Under-Secretary emitted a noise like a sealion in the zoo getting a fish at that point. I thought that that was an extremely relevant example. If we all emitted noises like that at the mention of Lothian, for example, on the Conservative Benches, the Committee would not make much progress. I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) on raising that case. I do not know it in detail, though I recall having read of it in the press. It has caused considerable anxiety in Edinburgh. It is a most unfortunate situation. It is a concrete example of the concern to which I refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the kind of case to which my hon Friend refers and the expressions of disquiet in recent reports by the Ombudsman, is there not a case for considering at this stage—when we are making a general revision of the powers of the Ombudsman and amending schedule 1 of the 1975 Act, which sets up the Ombudsman scheme— the need to give a final statutory power perhaps to move in and to issue a direction to a local authority if it had not responded to a section 29 report? I accept that that would only be used in very rare and occasional cases. One might even hope that there was no need whatsoever for it. There might be a number of different ways in which one could do it. For example, one could give the Ombudsman power to go to the Court of Session to get a direction or an order. I think that the Secretary of State has that power in certain circumstances, in different areas of local government and under different statutory enactments. I should have thought that there was a case for saying that, on the very rare occasion when there is a really obtuse and thrawn local authority which is not prepared to move even in the face of repeated lequests by the Ombudsman, there should be a right, either for him or for the individual complainer, to implement the report, either by a direction by the Ombudsman or by going to the courts which would require some sort of statutory basis for the action. It seems to me that at the moment we are perhaps looking at too few complaints to the Ombudsman. I do not want to be over-critical of local government, but the fact that we only have something under 300 references a year to the Ombudsman at the moment suggests to me that the Ombudsman's powers and place in the local government structure are not sufficiently recognised by the general public. With the best will in the world, it is inconceivable that there is not a very large number of cases which could validly be referred to the Ombudsman

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
if people realised that they had that right and had the confidence and knowledge to take them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of one occasion on which the question has been put to me: " What is the point of going to the Ombudsman, because at the end of the day all that he can do is to issue reports which may or may not be implemented?" It seems to me that the combination of that slight touch of cynicism which in certain quarters tinges the public attitude, the disquiet that has been mentioned in the Ombudsman's recent reports and the kind of individual case to which my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire has referred, at least add up to a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for considering whether this further change should not have been made on one of these rare occasions when we have a convenient statutory opportunity and where we are availing ourselves of that opportunity to make what are very minor amendments to the Ombudsman scheme and mode of operation. It would be very useful if the Under-Secretary could say a word or two about that. I do him the credit of thinking that this must at least have been considered. Perhaps he could explain why it was considered unnecessary. Will he have another look at it with a view to bringing in the necessary changes on Report if the view of the Committee that was clearly justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I rise to speak because I feel that there is much in what has just been said from the Opposition Front Bench. We ought to look very carefully at the power that the Ombudsman has, particularly under section 29. I know that there have been instances of local authorities in Scotland who have been reluctant to come forward and admit the error of their ways and to admit that they should do something about recompense for those who have been maladministrated against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to draw attention to the fact that the Ombudsman in Scotland, and indeed the local authority Ombudsman, is unique inasmuch as individuals can first apply to their councillors to have the matter referred to the Ombudsman and, if the councillor refuses to do so for whatever reason, the individual has the right to put it direct to the local authority Ombudsman. That is a very valuable service of which I feel that the public are just not generally aware. They feel that they have to do it in some other way. If nothing else comes out of this debate, this matter should be put across quite clearly to those who feel that they have a grievance and would like it looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I believe that the Government should have given serious consideration to the few—and they are a few cases—but genuine cases where the local authorities have been reluctant to accept their responsibilities and have refused to face up to their moral obligations. I regret to say that there have been cases which I have felt were just not justified. I have no wish to be political in this because it does not seem to matter what the political complexion of the authority is. If an authority somehow feels that it is above the Ombudsman and that somehow this meddling interfering devil should not be looking at it, it adopts what are often difficult and protracted attitudes towards resolving problems which, in my judgment, would be best resolved quickly and efficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said uncharacteristically that he was not making a party point, because according to the annual report of the Ombudsman, the only authority that he is having difficulty with is Banff and Buchan. I do not think there are Labour members in that authority and they are certainly not in control of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate. I must confess that I start with a slight bias in favour of local government. I am told it is another of my weaknesses and that I tend to justify and defend even Glasgow district council more than I should. Nevertheless, I would justify my general approach to local government because of the irresponsible attacks that are made by many Members of Parliament—and, I am sorry to say, by some of my own side from time to time—without any great understanding of local government and how it works. Therefore I do not feel that there are large numbers of cases that would come under the definition of section 24 where individuals—because it is individuals we are talking about—feel that an injustice has been done in consequence of maladministration. Injustice, linked with maladministration, certainly narrows it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody in Drumchapel who is still waiting for a house in Knightsbridge thinks there has been maladministration. It is not whether there is a 20 years' or a five years' tenancy; if they have not got a house they think there has been maladministration. I am not one who favours widening unduly the opportunity for members. There has to be a fairly tight definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire would probably agree that if the Select Committee is doing a job at all, the safeguard in local government is that an aggrieved person has the right to go to the Ombudsman without the consent or approval of his elected representative, which is unique in the general set-up. I welcome this opportunity to discuss the Ombudsman, because it is an important part of the local government set-up. For once it has given us an opportunity to discuss an annual report which is laid before Parliament, even though I do not suppose the Minister is very happy with our taking up time to discuss it. Nevertheless it is relevant that he is moving a whole schedule, making one or two quite significant changes. In paragraph 14 on page 4 of the annual report the Ombudsman says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Similar questions were raised when I was invited to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. I understand that both bodies are expected to report within the ensuing year."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 15 he goes on to say that he has given a written memorandum to the Stodart committee. I referred to that earlier. I presume Stodart will ultimately require legislation. Perhaps we can have some indication about when we are likely even to debate that, never mind any decisions taken by the Government, the paragraph goes on to refer to:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"a separate memorandum to the Scottish Development Department on the subject of possible changes in the legislation for the Ombudsman Service".</p></blockquote>
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), when making inquiries about the annual report, said that this must be the quickest annual report to be published by any Government Department. It is a constant source of complaint that re-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
ports of departments such as the Prison department do not appear until about a year after the end of the relevant year. Social work is the same. Because of the nature of the responsibility of the Ombudsman, it is commendable that the report is issued so speedily even though there is no comparison in the extent of responsibility. Paragraph 15 refers, as I have said, to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a separate memorandum to the Scottish Development Department on the subject of possible changes in the legislation for the Ombudsman Service".</p></blockquote>
Having said that this is a speedy report, I must say that it would be almost remarkable if the Scottish Office had translated that into legislative provision within a year. Was it luck or was it planned in advance, because we are making a few changes here which are quite significant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister to clarify the changes which are being made? What is the significance of the first change? The Library research note on the report that the Commissioner submits to the Secretary of State says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the report will be published, by the Commissioner, and not by arrangement with the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I presume that that is just a tidying-up matter and is not of any great consequence. What lies behind the change about the availability of the report? At the moment a person has the right to see the report and to have copies extracted. Does he have to pay, or is the authority obliged to give him a copy of whatever extract he wants from the particular report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the demand for the report itself, and will this be a costly change? That is a minor but fairly important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I never understand privilege in Parliament, but has the lack of it been an inhibiting factor in the past, since this privilege is now to be extended to officers of local authorities? I am not sure whether this is a dangerous extension of privilege. The press never reports me, so I feel free to say that we all have " heid bangers " as constituents, who inundate us and are well known to everybody. The trouble, as I am sure my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden will agree, is that they tend to be the kind who move from one constituency to another. I have one from Drumchapel who writes to everybody from the Queen downwards. I receive one letter a week. The legal jargon is " vexatious client". There is a tremendous burden. I wish that some worthwhile research were done into the amount of time spent by Members of Parliament and those in local government on what I would call vexatious clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the reasons for making this amendment. The Minister will accept that it is quite reasonable for us in Committee to ask why the Government want to extend privilege to cover every officer in a local authority who happens to be dealing with the Ombudsman. 1 think that it is a fair point. It is one on which I should like some information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point raised by the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to the provisions of this schedule which allow for copies of a report to be made available to a member of the public, and indeed to be purchased at a reasonable charge. Perhaps it is not appreciated that under the existing legislation copies of the report can be inspected by a member of the public and he may take extracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
For some curious reason it has not been possible for him up to now actually to acquire a copy, and it clearly is appropriate that it should be possible. That is what the provision suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly normal to include the reference to " a reasonable charge". That is not peculiar to this particular matter, as I am sure is well known to hon Gentlemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the remarks by the hon Member for Garscadden and my hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) about the problems if a local authority declines to implement the recommendation of the Commissioner. I think that on reflection that the hon Member for Garscadden would not wish to suggest that the Commissioner should have power to issue directives. The Parliamentary Commissioner has no such power with regard to Government Departments. It has always been thought inappropriate to consider such a power. But in practice public bodies, whether Government Departments or local authorities, have almost overwhelmingly responded to any criticism by either the local Ombudsman or the Parliamentary Ombudsman and have sought to implement his recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, in this schedule made certain provisions which go some way towards the point raised by hon Gentlemen. There is a situation, which I think has happened twice according to the 1980 Report, in which the Commissioner, having made an original recommendation and an original report to a local authority, has felt it necessary to issue a further report to that local authority because he has been concerned about its response. Until now there has been no obligation upon the local authority to consider that further report that the Ombudsman may have submitted to it. We have proposed an amendment in the schedule which would have the effect of imposing a comparable obligation upon the local authority if it is in receipt of a further report to consider that matter and respond to it. I am sure that that meets a great number of problems that might otherwise arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer in passing to the case of Mr. Gunkel, to which the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) referred. The Ombudsman has not indicated any desire to pursue the matter any further. Therefore, though there may still be certain problems concerning Mr. Gunkel, they are not problems of concern to the Ombudsman; they seem to relate more to Mr. Gunkel's relationship with Edinburgh district council, which is a different matter that no longer rests on the decision that the Ombudsman had reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the point that I was alluding to—-the fact that the Ombudsman's work had gone so far down the road but that when there was no possibility of its being processed in any formal way that Edinburgh district council had chosen to wash its hands of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon Gentleman is incorrect. The problem so far as I am aware in Mr. Gunkel's case is not so much the recommendations of the Ombudsman but the fact that, since the Ombudsman has reported, the matter has also been sent to arbitration. The arbitration led to a decision in favour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
of the member of the public, and that is a matter which is at the moment being negotiated between Mr. Gunkel and the district council, on which there are matters of concern. But it is not a matter of any further relevance so far as the Ombudsman himself is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) referred to the provision transferring responsibility for publishing the report to the Commissioner. It is at the moment with the Commission for Local Authority Accounts, and it has been felt for some time that that is not necessary. The Commissioner is himself perfectly capable of publishing his own report, and therefore there is no reason for the technical requirement for it to be published in the name of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts. This is an ample opportunity to make a change of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman also raised the question of the extension of the question of privilege. Here the situation at the moment is that any communication between an elected member of a local authority and the Commissioner or any of his staff is covered by privilege, but that does not extend to communications with officials of the authority who may be making exactly the same communication. In practice, most of the investigation of these matters would, in practical terms, be likely to be between the Commissioner and the officials rather than the elected members. If we wish to have a full, frank exchange of information, so that the Commissioner can pursue these matters, then, if it has been thought appropriate that privilege should extend to elected members in the same narrow way as regards an investigation, it should also extend to the officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking in any way of an extension of privilege to officials of a local authority for their general actings but simply in regard to the specific investigation by the Commissioner of a specific complaint. In all the other areas where the Parliamentary Commissioner or the local government Commissioner presently operate, it has been accepted as one of those where privilege of this kind is appropriate. Therefore, it would seem wrong in principle to exclude local authority officials from a similar protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is impeccable logic, but it does not tell us very much. Can a local authority member at present tell the Commissioner that he suspects that official X is guilty of corruption, or can he now say that councillor X is guilty of corruption or that there is an allegation of corruption—I am not suggesting that there is. Does privilege extend to that extent in local government in relation to the Ombudsman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would depend to a large extent on whether the context in which such a remark was made arose out of a specific complaint to the Commissioner which he was at the time investigating. If, in the course of such an investigation, a remark of that kind were made which was relevant to the complaint, certainly privilege would apply. If, however, a general statement were made which did not directly arise from the complaint being investigated by the Commissioner, the normal laws of defamation would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
apply. It is not, therefore, an absolute right. It has to be strictly relevant to the investigation of a complaint which has been referred to the Commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I can see a case for that. I think that it is perhaps a more usual form of words, but there is something to be said for "section 198(3)" in the sense that it is shorter. It is perfectly explicable.

The Minister might say a word or two about why he has gone for the somewhat lengthier wording—I was going to say "circumlocution", but that is not quite the right word—why he has decided to set out these words in extenso when he had discovered what seemed to me to be a very neat and intelligible short form of saying the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But it is obviously preferable that these matters should appear in the statue in the form
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
that is normally applied. If there were strong hostility I should not need too much persuasion, if it were a matter which seriously divided the Committee.

If he will consider these amendments he will see that they are amendments not to the Bill but to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972. While I am prepared to accept a great deal of responsibility for any of the amendments that may be required to the Bill, I hope that the hon Gentleman will absolve me from responsibility for any drafting inaccuracies that may have occurred in such earlier legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands me. If these are necessary amendments to the previous legislation, and they are now seen to be necessary, why were they not seen to be necessary when the Bill was drafted and included in it to save us from all this tedious discussion today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure who could properly be accused of being responsible for the tedious discussion to which the hon Gentleman has just referred, but he will appreciate that as soon as these matters are recognised as needing reform this radical reforming Government are very anxious to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely likely that this amendment will be the best example to support the Minister's claim to be a radical and reforming Minister. It may be a somewhat modest claim, but those in his position and with his masters must make do with what crumbs of comfort they can gather. His somewhat bland assertion that this was the normal drafting form is slightly shaken by the fact that he pointed out that he was amending the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act of 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably it was not felt by the civil servants who drafted the 1972 Act that this was the normal form. If they had, they would have drafted it in that form. The Minister is saying sotto voce, and no doubt with all due respect to their memory, for they are now departed, that they were wrong. Here was a splendid opportunity to get away from the normal form and possibly bring in a modest innovation—perhaps not an earth-shaking innovation, but one that had some little merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is normal on these occasions, I think, to count the words, but I do not think that we can do that usefully here. We had an opportunity of replacing 1J in. of type with ^ in. The saving in that respect seems to me to be worth a pause. We are doing it not only in amendments Nos. 56 and 57, which is consequential, but amendments No. 62 and No. 63, which is consequential to

No. 62. If it was an error, it was a repeated error. I prefer to think that possibly it was not an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, the Minister will not be surprised to hear, I do not intend to press this to a Division, I still think that the matter was worth raising. Perhaps the Minister should go back to discuss the normal form with his advisers and consider whether he should not lay down Rifkind's law, which is that precedent should not always be slavishly followed, if there is clearly advantage in departing from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have referred before to the very helpful motes on clauses and amendments, but schedule 2 takes a hit of wading through. The amendments that the Minister moved this morning were technical amendments. By no stretch of the imagination are the actual recommendations in the schedule technical amendments. I am deliberately giving the Minister the opportunity to substantiate the claim in the heading of the schedule,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Relaxation of Controls over Local and Other Authorities".</p></blockquote>
This is another most important subject, which deserves to be discussed. It would be quite wrong of this Committee or of the House to have the impression 'that the Government were doing anything other than kidding the troops about the relaxation of controls over local government. I shall come to some of them, 'because they are relevant. There will, I think, be complete agreement on 'the meed to minimise the wee pin pricks by central Government on local government. I am sure that the Minister will confirm this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the hon Gentleman one or two specific questions. I am sure the Minister will confirm that they are no more than that. There is nothing of substance, as far as I can see, in some of them, although I may be wrong. If there is, that is all the more reason why we should be spending some time on it. But it is consistent with the general trend in the new .relationship. We do not seem to have enough time to discuss some of these things, but this was one of the hopes, which I think has been borne out, that, in general terms, with fewer local authorities in Scotland there would be a greater opportunity to relax some of the central Government controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may well be desperately anxious to cut staff in the Scottish Office so that they can at least show 'that they are as good as any local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
authority. They will have a hard job. The staff in the Civil Service Departments are much more skilful at preserving their own positions than the staff in local government. Therefore, I am curious to know what staff will be saved in the Scottish Office as a result of these relaxations. Will it be 1 per cent? Will it be 10 per cent? What costing has been done? Will there be a corresponding increase if some of these relaxations of controls mean additional work to local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the custodians of public expenditure on the Government side such as the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) are missing once again. I know there are other Committees and I am not trying to take advantage of this, but here is a whole schedule dealing with a subject close to their hearts and there is not a ripple anywhere from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made the general point about supporting the relaxation of controls over local authorities, 1 would ask why some provisions are necessary. For example, paragraph 1 of schedule 2 amends the Burial grounds (Scotland) Act of 1855. Is this something that is causing great concern among authorities that own burial grounds? Paragraph 3 is about cremations. What is the problem here? Will this leave just the cremation fees and charges? This is a real matter. The Government's record, for instance, on death grant is appalling; I know my hon Friend for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will probably want to comment in greater detail about the campaign by Age Concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon Gentleman would 'be out of order if he started to discuss fees for cremation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, with great respect, Mr. Gourlay, paragraph 3 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 9 (fees for cremation) the words 'any such'"—</p></blockquote>
presumably meaning any such fees—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the words 'as may be authorised by any table approved by the Local Government Board' shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
We are amending the Cremation Act of 1902, and cremation was not all that popular in 1902 as far as I know, so I am assuming that some work is involved. The Government do not go to the bother of putting paragraph 3 in schedule 2 without some idea of what they are doing. Therefore, because of this relaxation, or what are the conditions for a local government hoard, or whatever that is in modem terms? Does it just not exist? Or does it mean that a local authority as of now has to submit its fees for cremation charges for approval to the Secretary of State? I am quite sure that the powers have never 'been used. Nevertheless, it is a matter of public interest, when we are amending a cremation Act, that we know what we are doing—putting it no higher than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by paragraph 7 on cattle-grids. I am sure that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will certainly want to know something about that because it is a burning issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely interesting ex
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
ample because it puts in perspective the reality of these apparent concessions. The last relevant sentence of the notes on clauses reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These powers have never been exercised."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that that is the nature of most of these fraudulent reforms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to one which I think has been. I hope that my hon Friend will enlighten me as to what he has just been quoting from—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have missed that somewhere. But I want to come to one of the serious points about paragraph 14. Paragraph 14 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsections (3) and (4) of section 3 (Secretary of State's involvement in appointment of any director of social work) shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry that my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) is not here at the moment. As an ex-official of NALGO—I always seem to be referring to this—he would, I should think, be interested in this matter. Does this relaxation mean that the appointment of the director of social work is now entirely a matter for the appropriate authority? Am I confusing myself and possibly the Committee by recollecting the stramash that there was about the appointment of a director of social work in Grampian region; was (that to do only with qualifications that are laid down or was it to do with the Secretary of State's involvement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not disagree with the authority or the power being given to the local authorities—they are responsible enough for that—'but I presume that this is a legacy of the 1968 Act. It is not long in parliamentary terms since that was passed. I presume that this is a legacy of the past when the appointment of certain local government officials—chief constables, I think medical officers of health and environmental officers—was subject to the consent of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So on this question of the appointment of the directors of social work—some of them might be NALGO members at that level as well as members of the British Association of Social Workers—I would be interested in the reason for paragraph 14 being included in schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other points which I think worthy of attention. In paragraph 29, we are changing a more recent Act, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, in its reference to "chairman". Without going into any great detail, this is a matter which causes great controversy at local government level. I presume, but I should like this confirmed, that we are now allowing a unit of local government to change its name without the approval of the Secretary of State. I should be grateful for clarification on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I referred earlier—this is what happens when we rush things—to paragraph 32:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(default powers of Secretary of State as regards community councils scheme) shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
	<i>Hansard</i> has mislaid the quotation I had from 	<i>Hansard</i> that referred to the representations that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
had been made by some community councils. I think that they were all from the South of Scotland, but I cannot remember the particular ones. What are we doing here? A matter which involves community councils is certainly of great interest to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, Mr. Gourlay, that you might agree in the light of all that I have said that, though my hon Friend has pointed' out to me that these powers have not been used, there are an awful lot of powers hanging about and, if they have not been used, they do not mean anything. So in terms of relaxation of control, we have no right to assume that these are fundamental and radical changes. I am merely seeking some of the reasons why we are making these changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for the fact that it is difficult for me to give my undivided attention to the Committee's proceedings, because I am simultaneously giving my undivided attention to the proceedings in Committee Room 6, where the Forestry Bill is under consideration and where I have recorded six votes so far this morning. It is relevant that I should be concentrating on forestry, because there are points in the schedule to which Government amendments have just been agreed involving tree preservation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to speak about tree preservation orders and the way in which the present system works. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us in a little more detail what effects the amendments would have. There is some concern in rural parts of Scotland about the way in which the tree preservation order system works. There needs to be a balance between commercial good sense and forestry management on the one hand and amenity considerations on the other. In other words, trees which are of benefit to the amenity of any part of the country and which are in a healthy and safe condition should be preserved', while it should be possible to fell trees which could be a danger, particularly on roadsides. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the precise effects of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, it has been almost too easy for enthusiastic individuals to start preservation orders around the countryside on individual trees willy nilly, without regard to the wider benefits of the community and without consulting the owners of the land on which the trees are growing. In part of my constituency, the former county of Berwickshire, there was a very enthusiastic gentleman Who died not long ago, who was chairman of the planning committee of the former county council. He felt strongly about trees, and all over Berwickshire we have half-dead or entirely dead trees on which there are tree preservation orders and which it is not possible for the landowners, the farmers or anyone else to get rid of. That is an extreme state of affairs, and I hope that the Minister will get it under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is another type of individual who has a legitimate concern about trees growing on other people's land, but who has no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
statutory protection whatever. I am speaking of people who live in their own houses, minding their own business, but who have a tree on someone else's land overhanging theirs. The Minister may be aware that I have been corresponding with him about such a case. It is curious that local authorities apparently have no power—or so I have been advised by East Lothian council, and it has been confirmed by the Minister on behalf of the Scottish Office—to have a tree removed, although it may endanger members of the public, either on the road or in their houses. It would be helpful if the Minister could say a word or two about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of what my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) said about the possible effects of these provisions on the expenditure of the Scottish Office. It would be interesting to know whether the relevant expenditure, as the Minister would describe it, of the Scottish Office is being reduced in view of the reductions— or supposed reductions—in responsibilities which will be brought about as a result of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to talk at length about some of the other legislation which will be affected by the schedule, such as the Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act. But I am sure that you, Mr. Gourlay, and the Committee will be relieved to learn that I shall ask only one further brief question about something which my hon Friend the Member for Provan has already mentioned—the Highways (Provision of Cattle-Grids) Act 1950, which we are told is to be repealed because it has never been brought into effect. I understand that that Act enabled the Secretary of State for Scotland to lay down regulations which prescribed the standards and physical factors which should be taken into account when cattle grids were being constructed. One minor detail about which some people feel strongly concerning cattle grids, and I am sure that certain hon Members will have had correspondence about it in the past, is the risk to hedgehogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cattle grids can effectively prevent hedgehogs from getting out of a field, because they cannot negotiate the grid. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing the effects of cattle grids. We are merely discussing the transfer or the withdrawal of powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am trying to make, Mr. Gourlay, is that the Minister is attempting to do away with .powers which in my opinion probably ought to be retained. As I have explained, cattle grids effectively prevent large livestock from getting out of fields or on to the road. That 	<i>is</i> fair enough. But if a hedgehog tries to negotiate a cattle grid it falls through and is killed. Serious suggestions were made some years ago that regulations should be made which would make it compulsory for a small ramp to be included in the pit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman's remarks are quite interesting, if not humorous, 'but I would prefer him to come to the question whether the schedule should be the second schedule to the Bill, which includes whether the Secretary of State is correct in withdrawing his power over the local authority in respect of cattle grids.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make, Mr. Gourlay, is that there is a need for standards of cattle grids to foe kept under control, and that the right person to do that is the Secretary of State, under the powers which exist under the Highways (Provision of Cattle-Grids) Act 1950. The Minister is trying to do away with these powers, I have tried to argue that it is desirable that he should retain these controls so that cattle grids can be constructed in a safe manner and will foe safe for pedestrians and other road users, and also for other forms of wild life, such as hedgehogs, which are at present dying in large numbers because they are falling into these things and cannot get out. It is perfectly feasible to provide small ramps at a low cost, and I think that this is an example of a condition which the Secretary of State could usefully apply to this legislation. I therefore deplore the fact that he is trying to demit these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading the former Secretary of State for Scotland, my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), referred to this schedule in scathing terms. He talked about
	<br><blockquote><p>"a mass of tiny reductions in the Secretary of State's control over local authorities. However, those relaxations are trivial compared with the massive increased powers of intervention in the affairs of local authorities that the other clauses will give to the Secretary of State.	<i>"—[Official Report, 9</i> December 1980; Vol. 995, 	<i>c.</i> 1227.]</p></blockquote>
It is in that context that we should look at the pro-visions in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that several of the provisions were in disuse in any case, that they had hardly ever been used. They are therefore a nonsense. They are falling into disrepute just as a great deal of law dating back for centuries has fallen into disrepute, and from time to time we bring forward legislation to get rid of it, to sweep the cupboard clean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to the document laid on the Table which could presumably have relevance to this schedule and clause. Crnnd. 7634 issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales in September 1979, refers specifically to Scotland in paragraph 8:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State for Scotland proposes consultation as soon as possible with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and other interested parties about Scottish controls which might be abolished forthwith, and others which might be jointly examined as candidates for abolition or relaxation."</p></blockquote>
The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In many cases the appropriate action can be taken by order under Section 209 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973".</p></blockquote>
I presume that the provisions in schedule 2 are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
those which cannot be catered for under the procedure outlined in paragraph 8 of the document; otherwise it would be done by order instead of being included in a Bill of this nature. The document goes on, in paragraph 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has already acted to reduce the volume of circulars and other communications sent to local authorities. It is now exercising a stringent control over the issue of any such papers. In addition the Government is reviewing its need for statistical information from local authorities".</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of those quite important provisions. To say that it is enhancing freedom to sanction local authorities not to provide statistics to the Government, is somewhat sinister. If the Government are insisting that statistical information coming from local authorities to central Government should be reduced	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup -->, and at the same time going out of their way to insist that local authorities provide figures for staffing purposes, we should like to know what is in the Government's mind. It is interesting that there is no reference in the schedule to provision of statistical information from local authorities. Will that be done by order under the provisions of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the more ridiculous matters mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) is paragraph 29 of the schedule. It is an amazing proposition. We are rapidly making an industrial desert of Scotland. We shall probably have a miners' strike on our hands in a matter of days, or even hours, yet here we are, wasting our time in a Scottish Committee on the subject of titles on a council. We are debating whether the title of chairman or other title shall be left to the council to decide. I can suggest many titles that might be decided on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, as do other hon Members, that when some tinpot dictators get on a local council, still more into Parliament, and even on a community council, they start thinking that they are running the show and get all kinds of inflated views of their own importance. I could quote examples but I do not want to identify persons. Let us suppose that someone on a Tory council becomes the champ and it goes to his head and he says he wants to, be called "king."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Duke of Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is allowed to under this. He has a Tory majority on that council—damned good idea. They are clannish up in the Highlands. He might be called chief of the Tory clan. It is all there in section 29.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. There are all kinds of possibilities. Seriously, we all know that there are councillors who let their ambitions and their feeling of importance run away with them. This is carte blanche for them to do just that.

In Kirkcaldy district they still 'have them hung up somewhere from the old Kirkcaldy borough council, as you well know, Mr. Gourlay, in a kind of museum, ready perhaps to be used by some future Tory council if there ever is one.

There are all kinds of imaginative schemes to attract the tourists. If there were two or three kings or queens in the Highlands on local authorities it would attract the American tourists, the Canadians and others. I mention those facts to show how absurd this schedule is in the face of the other powers that the Government are taking, the real powers that they are taking, into their hands, destroying all semblance of what we have known in democratic local government. Then they present us with this nonsense. It should be shown up for the ridiculous irrelevance that it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disturbed by this procedure of legislation by schedule. The more we look at it the more we realise what is being tucked in under a schedule to an Act. I understand that there is some proposal that the Canadian patriation Act might be dealt with in this kind of way by putting something innocuous into the main clauses and then packing all the contentious items into the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take part of the blame but to some extent we might almost have been derelict in our duty on the Opposition side in not tabling even more amendments to the schedule to deal with some of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) raised a serious point about titles of chairman of local authorities. He raised it in his usual robust and light-hearted way, but it is a serious point. In retrospect I think we might have tabled an amendment—we shall have another opportunity on Report—to get rid of the title of lord provost once and for all. There is absolutely no reason why the chairman of four district councils out of all the district councils that exist should have the title of lord provost. There is no power that Edinburgh exercises that is not exercised by Cumnock and Doon Valley district council. If the chairman of Edinburgh district council should be glorified with the title of lord provost, why should not the chairman of Cumnock and Doon Valley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that there would not be entire unity on the Opposition side of the Committee for that amendment? There is some virtue in recognising the position of the four cities. But has he considered the possibility that, as there is now no restriction on what an authority wants to call its chairman, every district council could now decide to call its chairman lord provost, or is that still the exclusive property of the four cities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With two lawyers on the Front Benches, who am I to interpret these draft statutes? My reading is that it would be possible for Cumnock and Doon Valley to call its chairman lord provost. I do not envisage Cumnock and Doon Valley wishing to do that because it is a sensible, reasonable and, above all,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
Labour-controlled authority which is quite happy to call its chairman the convenor. But, seeing my good friend the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), opposite, I envisage that Perth might take this opportunity to change the name because it has that historic link and it was aggrieved last time that it was not included along with the four cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend. Perhaps a suitable title for the Provost of Perth would be the Fair Maid of Perth. There are historical associations there and it would be very good for the tourist image of the city, which is a major preoccupation of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to pursue that argument too much because there might be some embarrassments in the discussion if we go down that particular line. But, in all seriousness, I can see that the chairman of that district council might feel the wish to call himself Lord Provost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present incumbent is known as the Provost of Perth and Kinross district, but I agree with the hon Gentleman that I, amongst others, regret the passing of the office of Lord Provost for the city of Perth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point. I envisage that the hon Gentleman, once this becomes law, will be saying that one of the things—one of the few things— that they have done for local government is that the title of Lord Provost can be used. Having seen the chap coming along, if it is the same fellow—I think it is —who welcomes us to Perth on the occasions that we go there every March, I am sure he would be very happy; he is just the sort of man who would want to call himself that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think my hon Friend has raised a very good point. At the time that these major controls that we saw in previous clauses are being taken from local government, we are giving them this freedom. It is a lot of nonsense but it has some worrying features and I go along with what my hon Friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also find some peculiar rationale behind the reasons given in the helpful notes on clauses. Of paragraph 29 they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new local authorities have been established for 6 years and the Secretary of State's control over titles of chairmen no longer appeared necessary."</p></blockquote>
There does not seem to be any rationale behind that. They are likely to be just as keen to change their names to adopt particular titles now as they were six years ago. They have not got over some of the alleged losses that they suffered at that time, as the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire has amply demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving on from paragraph 29, I have some reservations the more I hear discussion in the Committee. Again, I think that we should pay a particular tribute to my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) for raising this and for alerting us to some of these points. I am worried about paragraphs 31 and 32 and I ask the Minister if he can explain to me exactly what is meant by these. I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
read the various explanations and the further explanations to the Government's further amendments and I find them very confusing and in some ways contradictory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could ask him in this kind of way. Is my understanding of the position right that, when this is enacted in the form put forward by the Government with these amendments, it will be possible for a local authority to amend the scheme of community councils without any power by the Secretary of State to overrule that or to veto what the local authority plans to do? That is my understanding of it and if that is the case I predict here and now that that strong, reactionary Fascist council, the city of Edinburgh district council, will follow this power by getting rid of its community councils. It did not want to have them in the first place. It was only because my right hon Friend the former Secretary of State, the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), squeezed them into the position of having to set up community councils. They procrastinated and found every possible device. When we were talking about schemes they tried to put up a fraudulent scheme of one community council for the whole area so that they would not fulfil the spirit of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member and all his flummery tend to live in the past anyway. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, some people use their titles on appropriate occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that Edinburgh district council was one of the councils that relish, enjoy, revel in living in the past. I predict that if my interpretation is right Edinburgh district council will get rid of the democracy that has been set up within the authority by the pressure of the Secretary of State to have community councils. That would be a retrograde step. I cannot see other authorities doing it, because they went ahead and set up community councils. Edinburgh is the one which worries me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to raise, because I was backtracking on some of the arguments about titles which the hon Member for South Ayrshire has been discussing. What is worrying me is whether the present convener of the Lothian regional council might get illusions of grandeur and decide to call himself "Marquess of Lothian".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting thought, and there might then be some confusion. The Copyright Act might well be involved. I do not think that we are repealing any part of the Copyright Act or Patents Act in the schedule. But it is a serious point about community councils. The people who have striven hard are not all of my political persuasion; one or two of them are of the Government's persuasion. I see the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) awakening with interest. He knows personally some of the people who were concerned about community councils, and they will have some reservations about what is being suggested here—giving this freedom, this licence, to Edinburgh district council to backtrack on the provision of community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
I am also concerned at the way in which there will be no control over local authorities changing their names. That may seem a small thing, but presumably the Secretary of State approved the change of name of one district council that took place recently. I am sure that the hon Member for Edinburgh, West will agree with this. A district council changed its name from the honourable and historic name of Lanark to Clydesdale, of all things. As someone said to me recently, it sounds like a horse. I found it strange when I saw the name on the A70, as I drove out of my own constituency in Cumnock and Doon Valley. I was faced with a sign saying " Clydesdale District". There did not seem to be any pressure from the local people, and there did not seem to be any desire to change the name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State and his Government are always worried about public expenditure. He should think about the public expenditure involved when a local authority changes its name—the notepaper, the signs when one enters the district, and so on. Putting this into the schedule is almost giving encouragement to local authorities to change their name, to alter their community council schemes, to change the title of their chairmen. I find grave doubts entering my mind about it, and I think we ought to look at it in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a different tack, I turn to paragraph 3 on charges for cremation. I find it astounding that the Minister, who presumably has some responsibility for helpful notes that we receive, should say that in the present inflationary period such requests have become regular and have never been refused. Has the hon Member no faith in the Government's stated policy that they will keep down inflation and that by the end of the year it will be in single figures? This seems to be a revelation that the hon Member believes that inflation will not be brought under control. He seems to be following the path of the right hon Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) rather than the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It seems to me that it is more alarming than that. If my hon Friend looks at the introductory notes to which he has wisely referred, he will see that they say that in the present inflationary period such requests have become regular and have never been refused. Is not the alarming feature the fact that the Government have had power to hold down cremation charges but that they are virtually flaunting in these notes the fact that such powers have never been used? No doubt other Governments have been sinners, too. But, given that the Government have refused, and given the inadequate level of death grant and their obstinate refusal to do anything about that, there is a clear case for not only keeping the powers but for using them to hold down the ever-escalating cremation fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend. It has been suggested to me that that is deliberately fuelling fires of inflation in this case. That would seem to be the interpretation. I have considerable concern about the level of the death grant. This does not now even cover the fees for cremation, let alone all the other costs involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently I was partly responsible—I played a small part in the matter—for helping to get a million signatures on a petition to seek an increase in the death grant. Representatives of the all-party pensioners' group went to present the petition to the Prime Minister.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>531</span>
That right hon Lady refused even to meet them. That shows the kind of concern the Government have. As my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden said, this is a small power to help keep down costs, a power that might have helped to keep down inflation, which the Government are throwing away. They are totally abandoning it, just as they did the Price Commission earlier. This is the kind of thing we have come to expect from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
The more I look at the schedule, the more I realise that in it there are unacceptable parts, some retrograde, depressing parts, which we must return to when we have an opportunity to consider the Bill at a later stage.
