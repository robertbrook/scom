	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, Mr. Gourlay, you chastised me for wasting time by drawing attention to the absence of the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). You were right to say that that was not worthy of attention, because the hon Gentleman's absence is a regular occurrence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was really intending to draw attention to an article in the 	<i>Scottish Sunday Express.</i> I look forward with interest to the amendments that the hon Member for Aberdeen, South will be tabling in the light of his views expressed in that article, and I am sure that our proceedings will be interesting. I assure you, Mr. Gourlay, that I was not wasting time. The point was relevant to the remarks which I intended to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was kept in the House until the ridiculous hour of one o'clock this morning, I am sorry to say that I have not had time to read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee's proceedings on Tuesday, but I believe they confirm my original impression that the Minister was not on top form. I am not being patronising when I say that this provision is not a nice ideological measure such as selling council houses. It is probably the most complicated bit of local government legislation, equalled only by the rate support grant. Therefore, the Committee will not be surprised if I come back to some points which need clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that clause I is a key clause. As the Minister said, it is interlinked with and related to clause 2, but clause 1 itself is an important part of the Bill. Fortunes can change rapidly in politics, and certainly in Parliament. The Government are going through an accident-prone period, what with leaks—some deliberate, some not planned—and with matters of privilege. Just because the Minister has survived one reshuffle, he should not push his luck too far and think that he can get away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>" at present there has to be either a full revaluation or none. There is no provision for a partial revaluation. I know that that is mentioned more specifically in clause 2, but it is relevant here because the two clauses are interlinked."</p></blockquote>
In other words, clause 1 is very important. It deals with the ability to alter a date by affirmative resolution and not by primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>" If the Government were simply concerned with the 1983 revaluation, they could have used the Bill to announce a change —if there was to be a change—in the date of that revaluation. But, because we genuinely believe that the whole system is unnecessarily rigid in requiring primary legislation to postpone either a full or a partial revaluation, we believe that an affirmative order is far more sensible and flexible and does not deny any legitimate interest the requirement that it deserves."</p></blockquote>
In Government language that means that it is easier to get an affirmative order than a Bill through the House. The Opposition do not dispute that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential part of those remarks was that the Government presumably must intend to muck around with revaluation. Otherwise, they could have a one-off amendment which would merely postpone the 1983 revaluation. Which is it? Is it merely a theoretical exercise to have more flexibility? Where is the demand for the flexibility? Flexibility means that there is a serious challenge to a five-year period being acceptable and normal. Who is building up the pressure for the period to be other than five years? The Minister did not attempt to answer that or give any reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon Gentleman will have read every word that he said in Tuesday's debate. He further confused the issue when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Conservative Party manifesto of 1979 refers to domestic rates. It states that the abolition of domestic rates is a Government commitment for the longer term. … The longer term means that it will certainly not be possible within this present Parliament … in regard to any change in the domestic rating system that might be made in the next Parliament."</p></blockquote>
In the light of what the hon Gentleman said, what is the Government's intention? Is it to review or to abolish domestic rating in this Parliament or the next Parliament, or is it, as he said in his reply to the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) to have a review of the whole rating system, including commercial and industrial premises? I do not make an apology for returning to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On revalution, I am willing to say that a major factor that the Secretary of State will have to take into account in determining whether there is to be a 1983 revaluation will be the likelihood of any abolition of the domestic rating system, or of any fundamental change in the rating system."</p></blockquote>
Is that assumed or expected in the life of this Parliament, or is it a pre-election commitment with at least the machinery of Government prepared in such a way that it could be put into operation fairly soon, in the unfortunate event of the Conservative Party being returned to power? I am still confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Replying to his hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East, the Minister later said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I referred specifically to the domestic ratepayer because that was the only element referred to in our election manifesto, but the current internal review is of the rating system as a whole, including industrial and commercial rating."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 January 1981; cc. 25–9.]</p></blockquote>
I am not being unkind but I did not think that the Minister dealt with the issue with his usual clarity. I have no doubt that he will wish to return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not just making a debating point. Conservative Members must realise that this is a serious matter. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East who raised the question knows that I am not a debater. I wish to get at the facts. We should turn to the fount of all wisdom, the Secretary of State for Scotland, who gave
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
a prepared speech on Second Reading. It is the easiest speech in the House to make, and should be right. It is usually right—if a Minister sticks to his brief. That applies to all Secretaries of State. The right hon Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" But clearly there is no point in revaluing property if shortly thereafter rates are no longer payable on it, and it therefore seems sensible to introduce some flexibility into the arrangements for revaluations. Clause 1, therefore, will make it possible, by order, to change the dates for revaluation."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State then said, referring to clause 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To make possible such a restriction in the scope of revaluations is entirely consistent with our policy towards domestic rates which assumes that radical reform may apply to only one part of the rating system.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But reform may be some time off. In the meantime, it makes sense to maintain the rating system in good order."—[	<i>Official Report, 9</i> December 1980; Vol. 995, cc. 1219–20.]</p></blockquote>
Clauses 3 to 11, which are relatively minor, do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that I have established not clarity but doubt in the minds of hon Members on both sides of the Committee about the purpose of the clause. Is it a commitment in the longer term—not in this Parliament—to abolish domestic rates? Alternatively, has there been fresh thinking, if that is possible for this Government, in which they recognise that the idea of abolishing domestic rates was an election gimmick, which they cannot get away with because of the alarm and despondency that there would be in commercial and industrial circles, especially in Scotland, in the present economic climate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is on record as saying that the internal review covers all aspects of rating, but the Government presumably have a commitment to abolish domestic rating. Is it intended to happen in the lifetime of this Parliament or in the longer term—in the next Parliament, as the Secretary of State has said?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have stated both points clearly and specifically, to enable the Minister to clear up the matter. The Christmas Recess is marvellous, but it is not conducive to doing homework. We have now had a chance to go over the Bill more thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hardly anybody mentioned part I on Second Reading. We were clearly paying attention to the perhaps more obvious political attacks on local government and the rate support grant, and to a lesser extent the housing support grant. We shall come to those aspects later. Therefore, I make no complaint. We were just as guilty, if that is the right word, as the Government were of focusing attention on what at the time were regarded as the key issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, part I is a fundamentally important part of the Bill, and clause 1 is certainly an important clause in part I. Therefore, doubts remain in my mind about the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend attach any significance to the fact that a large number of Conservative Back Benchers on the Committee have added their signatures to an early-day motion which calls on the Government to introduce a more acceptable alternative method of financing local government during the lifetime of this Government? If it would help my hon Friend, I should be happy to list those Back Benchers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman would be entirely out of order if he attempted to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has plenty of material there for a speech, either on this clause or at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that always worries me is that, because local government generally has never been popular, some people use it as a whipping boy. Unfortunately, some Opposition Members are also prone to do this. I have never indulged in it, but I recognise that for popular political purposes, even for the residents of North Berwick on occasion, a little opportunism might be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in the least surprised that in general Conservative Members, especially when the Government are so unpopular in the country, attempt to blame Labour-controlled authorities. We shall return to that matter on other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have established two points. First, there is doubt about what the Government intend to do. We can see why the clause is needed, depending on what the Government's intention is and when they intend to carry it out or on what options they are trying to keep open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But not one word has been mentioned about consultation with interested parties. It is not for me to speak for the CBI Scotland, or the chambers of commerce— they are pretty vocal at times. I do not know whether the Scottish TUC has been consulted. COSCA does not send us much material, but as far as I know it has said that it wants to stick to the 1983 revaluation. I do not know whether it has been consulted about possible effects on staffing—cuts or additional staff, depending on what the Government do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council a role in this matter? Has it been consulted? Have the assessors, or NALGO, been consulted? I must watch what I say; NALGO is not the easiest of unions, and it is not in the best of moods at present about local government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am suggesting is that the Minister has failed to give us any real reasons for clause 1. In the light of what I have said, unless there are good and sound reasons for it, and more information forthcoming, I have grave doubts as to whether we should accept the clause in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sad that the hon Gentleman is still confused at this stage in the debate. His confusion appears to stem from the one fact alone—that the Government have not stated what will happen to the rating system. He is quite correct in that, because the Government have not yet come to a final decision. But it is not a sound proposition to suggest that that invalidates the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether any radical or substantial change in the rating system were to occur towards the latter part of this Parliament or were to be reserved for the next Parliament, the possibility of such a change would cast grave doubts on the worth of going through the machinery of a revaluation in 1983. A revaluation in 1983 would have a significant impact on decisions, not in this Parliament, but in the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I make no apology for the fact that we have not yet come to a decision. If there is to be a substantial change either in domestic or industrial rating, or in both, such a change will be just as relevant to the 1983 revaluation if it occurs in the next Parliament as in the latter part of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this is essentially an enabling provision. It will enable the Secretary of State, with the approval of Parliament, to allow a postponment if that is considered appropriate. The clause does not seek or purport to go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept that the hon Gentleman is correct in saying that I have not given any answers as to what will happen to the rating system, I have tried to explain that that is because no decisions have been reached. A review is going on, and when decisions have been reached, they will be announced in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that explanation does not answer the points raised by the hon Gentleman, I hope that he will at least appreciate that, for the reasons that I have given, the answers are not available now. They will be made available to him—and to other hon Members—as soon as decisions have been reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to prolong this debate, Mr. Gourlay. We have had a good look at clause 1, and we have probably been given as much or as little information as we shall get from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who looks at the Official Report of Tuesday's debate will see that the Opposition approach the clause with a proper caution, but with no sense of open hostility. If adequate explanations had been forthcoming about the Government's intentions and the need for what is really a quite important enabling power, we would have been prepared to give the clause a fair wind. But we are not happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having read what the Minister said on Tuesday, and having listened to his further brief contribution this morning, we think that there is a strong presumption against putting such powers on the statute book. We do not think that a good and cogent case has been made for them. In the circumstances, my view is that it would be unsafe to put the clause into the Bill and I advise my hon Friends to vote accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) also purported to speak for the Opposition on these matters. At the end of the Committee's deliberations, on Tuesday, no doubt when he thought that he was winding up on behalf of the Opposition and did not appreciate that his hon Friends were still to make contributions, the hon Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>'Although the Opposition may well not divide on the issue, we are certainly worried about anomalies."—[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 13 January 1981; c. 39.]</p></blockquote>
Is the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) saying that the Opposition's attitude has been entirely changed by the contribution of the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be quite incapable of understanding the English language. What was said by my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill)
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
was not absolute. My hon Friend, who certainly speaks from the Front Bench, said that we might not divide against the clause. That was our position on Tuesday. There is nothing wrong with looking at the evidence of Ministers' replies. I should have thought that the Minister would have liked to think that he was not wasting his time when he replied to debates and made contributions in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon Gentleman that we read with care what he says and try, in a fair and open-minded way, to evaluate it. We have gone through that rather painful and disappointing process over the last 48 hours and we find that his replies are extremely— [Hon Members: "Devious."] "Devious" is perhaps unfair, but certainly we find them flat, disappointing and rather vague. In those circumstances we have taken up the option clearly indicated in the word "may" and decided that we should divide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. I specifically asked the Minister what consultation there had been with any of the interested parties. There has been none. That in itself would merit inquiry. I do not understand, in these days of participation and democracy everywhere, including the Labour Party, how a Minister can expect to get away with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister will get away with it. It is deplorable. I hope that the Minister is not disappointed that he has succeeded in prolonging this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an open mind on a number of these technical questions. We are not zombies. We do not make set decisions in advance of the debate and hold to them irrespective of the argument. It may surprise the Minister to know that if he had been able to produce a cogent case, which he occasionally does on technical matters when he has been well briefed, we might have taken a different decision about this vote. The fact that we now feel forced to vote against the clause is a measure of his own shortcomings in convincing a fair, open-minded and flexible bunch of Labour politicians of the Tightness of what the Government are trying to do. Therefore, merriment that he is displaying is out of place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 finished on Tuesday in time to give the Minister an opportunity to make a full reply. What we had was a very short statement made in indecent haste in an attempt to end the proceedings. His reply was in no way along the lines that I was seeking. For these reasons my hon Friends and I have reached the conclusion which my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly fair. This is an enabling power. The Minister has not explained it properly or justified it. It is not a matter of party dogma or principle on which we could not have given way. We should have been prepared to listen to his arguments, but, having found them wanting, we shall stick to our guns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised a very important point.

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
as no doubt many of my hon Friends will be, to make a second and perhaps even third contribution on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has said that it is our intention to divide, I am sure that he will agree with me that we might have second or third thoughts if the Minister, even at this late stage, gave us the real reasons behind the clause, if he answered the questions put by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) today and on Tuesday, and the points that I made on Tuesday about specific examples. I am sure that you, too, Mr. Gourlay, would be willing to give the Minister more time to answer the points that were raised, and to flummox the Opposition once more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 11, leave out from "that" to "specified" in line 12 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"any land and heritages classed as domestic and".</p></blockquote>
We have spent some time, but not an excessive amount, discussing clause 1, which is comparatively simple in its meaning and concept. I cannot say the same of clause 2, which I find opaque and at times downright difficult. I have no doubt that we shall want a good deal of clarification on a number of matters. I believe that most of the argument will centre on the next group of amendments, which deal with what appears to be an inherent contradiction—although I recognise that there must be a technical explanation— particularly in preserving the ratio between specified and unspecified categories of land and heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is more limited, but it gives an opportunity to raise a number of points and to invite information from the Minister. I say, unashamedly, that at this stage it is a probing amendment, and may remain so, but I reserve my position, because I genuinely want to understand exactly how this rather complicated provision will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
The effect of the amendment is that the specified category would have to be domestic property or a part of it. If a category is specified, it will be subject to valuation or revaluation under the new provisions of clause 2. It is not clear what is meant by "specification" and what can be "specified". It is, perhaps, easy to assume that it will be a simple, straightforward category, such as a domestic, commercial or industrial property, public utilities, or a miscellaneous category which appears in the normal breakdown of properties for valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be a good deal more familiar than I am with the categories in the Rating Review—I am looking at the 35th issue, dated June 1980. All the categories to which I refer are mentioned there. Is it a multiple choice for "specification" under clause 2? Will the Minister or his successor be able to nominate one of those categories? Perhaps it is self-evident that he would have that choice, but it would be good to have it confirmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more important—I am less confident about this in my speculation—is whether the Minister can specify a subdivision of these categories. For example, can the Minister say whether it is possible to specify domestic property which was under or over a certain level of rateable value in the immediately previous valuation roll? The Rating Review states that for purposes of their rateable value domestic properties are divided into bands of £1 to £100, £301 to £400, over £500, and so on. Is it open to the Minister to specify not only domestic, but domestic properties whose rateable values are, for example, over £300, and therefore leave as unspecified—and so to be put into the new valuation roll under the old system— all properties whose valuation fell under £300? It is important to know whether that area of discretion and choice is open to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter of fundamental importance which will condition our future discussion. The Government might argue "We will make it commercial property" or even "We will have a cut-off of the band to subdivide or to refine that specification or exercise of choice." Can the choice also be geographically defined? Will certain categories of property be specified in Lothian but not in Strathclyde, or in Dumfries but not in Grampian? Or does it have to be on an all-Scottish basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point is important because clause 2 says—I use this only for purposes of analogy—in regard to the ratio and the preservation of the ratio between specified and unspecified categories
	<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole".</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to know whether the Minister has in mind that any designation of a category will be on a Scotland-wide basis or whether it can be broken down on a local authority basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sorts of distortions and stresses and strains may be set up by the exercise of this machinery. If our contention is right, it is important that we know whether the distortions could occur on a local authority basis, or whether stress and strain would take place only between different categories of properties across all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
We are also entitled to ask for a little information about the Minister's intentions in respect of the exercise of discretion. I take a simple view—perhaps too simple a view—that by and large concepts, legislative or otherwise, are not spirited out of the air. If suddenly the Government's intentions appear in hard, cold print in a Bill—and they will be in harder, colder and more permanent print in an Act of Parliament— they are not just taking a shot at hazard; they have some intention in mind. The Government may not have hard and fast plans. They may not have dotted the i's and stroked the t's, but presumably, when enabling legislation such as this is taken, in his discussions with the Civil Service the Minister must have said "Yes, that is a good idea, because we shall probably want to do such and such." It is only fair that we should have an indication from the Minister of what is in his mind in regard to the specification and the use of clause 2. I do not believe that one takes enabling powers in the fullest sense "in case". There must be a particular, rather than a general, need for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem to be a well-founded speculation, particularly in view of the passages from the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our second sitting to which my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) referred, that it is unlikely that the Minister has it in mind to specify for revaluation certain categories of property which might benefit the domestic ratepayer. If the domestic ratepayer, as a result of this provision, were taken out of a revaluation, we are entitled to ask what plans the Government would have to replace the considerable loss of revenue which would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look, for example, at the ratable value for the Strathclyde region—I am sure that the Minister will be aware of these rough figures—we see that the ratable value of domestic subjects is £211 million, for commercial subjects it is £164 million and for public utilities it is £24 million. The miscellaneous figure is surprisingly high, at £99 million. For industrial subjects the figure is £72 million. That figure is slightly misleading, because there is 50 per cent, industrial derating, so for purposes of comparison that £72 million should probably be grossed up to £144 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the total of £571 million, the domestic category at £211 million is by far the most important. Therefore, any move to specify properties in a way that would shift the burden away from domestic ratepayers demands serious consideration. If it is in the Minister's mind, he should tell us now, and tell us a little more about how he would handle the resulting situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to impose upon the Committee speculation about how the revenue would be replaced. Clearly, the burden could not fall purely on industrial and commercial ratepayers. That would be a monstrous imposition, as I am sure the Minister would be the first to agree. I do not expect him to tell us whether it would be a direct charge on the Exchequer, whether there would be direct or indirect local taxation, or whatever. However, we are entitled to a little information about how this choice will be exercised as well as on the technical points that I have raised about the range and the definition of choice which I mentioned at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues on the Committee will have noticed, perhaps with some little distress, the way in which the Minister swept aside any suggestion of political con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
siderations coming into rating review and any move to help the domestic ratepayer. He waxed sarcastic about anyone who would be so unfair as to suggest any political considerations at all. I think that he protested a little too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a considerable political asset in the sense that he can give a picture of rectitude which, to those who know him not, can be quite deceiving. Sometimes there is a touch of the unco guid about his performance, as he disclaims any political considerations. But my own view is that he can scheme with the worst of them. Indeed, I pay him the tribute of saying that he is a politician. I do not believe, therefore, that he is being anything less than disingenuous when he suggests that he has no interest in political considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not say that it is a timeless political principle, but a principle that has existed for as long as politics is that one looks after one's own. I suspect that Conservative Ministers imagine, quite wrongly on the psephological evidence, that their own are owner-occupiers. Fortunately, an ever-increasing number of owner-occupiers are looking at the political record of the Conservatives and are deserting that political affiliation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I revert to what my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said earlier in his attack on the Under-Secretary. Would he not say that the hon Gentleman displays a model of consistency and that, irrespective of what might be to his political advantage on issues such as devolution and irrespective of what his Leader might have thought, he took a steady, consistent and wholly honourable line at all times?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has always had a rather individual view of politics. I cannot entirely endorse that comment, although I recognise from his final point that it may be defensible. But I should be trying your patience, Mr. Gourlay, if I got into matters of devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon Friend will accept the correction that nothing in the way of an attack on the Minister was implied in anything that I said in my brief remarks. Later in the Bill, on clause 13 for example, it may be necessary to make some political criticism—"attack" is perhaps too brutal a word. But at this point, particularly on this specific amendment, we are dealing to a large extent with technicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that we want to know whether the definition of the specified heritages can be used and is intended to be used to help the domestic ratepayer. I recognise that this category is probably on the Minister's conscience. He appealed to ratepayers directly during his election campaign, as did all his colleagues. We have seen what has happened to mortgage payments, we know what has happened to rates, and we know what will happen to rates in the future. They will spiral very fast in the coming year as a result of the various settlements imposed on local government by the Minister. I do not dispute that he will almost certainly be anxious to help if he can, but we are entitled to know exactly how he will do it and how the clause will be manoeuvred for that purpose, if that is the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I put to the Minister that general point about intention, particularly in regard to domestic rate-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
payers, and also the more particular points about whether the clause is geographically based, whether it is based on major categories such as commercial, industrial and domestic, or whether there can be refinements within them. I hope that, at least on this rather narrow amendment, those points will get the debate under way. We can turn to broader issues and other points when we come to the next and larger group of amendments. I wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause would provide, in the new paragraph (a)(i):
	<br><blockquote><p>" the Secretary of State may by order determine in respect of any new valuation roll being made up under this section that only such classes of lands and heritages as may be specified in the order shall be so valued or revalued."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of our amendment is to establish exactly what the Government have in mind. That is not clear from any of the material that I have read, from the research note that is obtainable in the Library, from what was said on Second Reading or, to me at any rate, from the notes that we have been given by the Scottish Office. Therefore, the amendment serves the useful purpose of establishing the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the new provision mean? How will the specification be made? I hope that the Minister can tell us, because I am not clear about it. What criteria will be used by the Secretary of State when he makes the order referred to in the new provisio to section 1(3)(a)? I shall not fall foul of you today, Mr. Gourlay, because I have been carefully studying how to avoid the pitfalls, but I hope that either now or in the stand part debate we shall be given the explanation that we are seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Secretary of State or anyone in the Department consult the assessors on how the new provision would work and how they would operate the order? If so, what was the result of the consultations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) is very strong on consultation. All of us who know him know how, when he was at the Scottish Office, consultation was what guided him in all that he sought to do on behalf of the Scottish people. May I say, on their behalf, how deeply grateful we all are. Certainly, consultation with the assessors would be important in deciding how the Secretary of State would act under the powers which the clause gives him. Will the Secretary of State consult the local regional assessor before he makes an order? What will be the mechanics of that consultation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the advantage of a piecemeal approach is that it allows for the updating of the valuation of a limited range of properties without the necessity of a general revaluation. If that approach is intended, the assessor's department, and the assessor in particular, will be closely involved. How will consultation be arranged? How will the order originate? How will the Secretary of State come to the conclusion that he should act on the provisions of the clause? Our amendment seeks to discover these important facts. I am sure that the Minister will give us this information today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
If the clause is accepted as it stands, without our amendments, I fear that there may be a lack of equity within one region, or between districts within a region. There could be imbalance in both, or there could be differences right across Scotland. I am not at all clear how it is intended that this power should be used. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said a great deal about distortions and how we should avoid them. Our amendment seeks to avoid such distortions, and our object is to get information from the Government. During this second full debate it is becoming more and more apparent how difficult it is to establish the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is well known for his eloquence; he is certainly the most eloquent of Government spokesmen in Scotland. That is the only compliment that I shall pay him in this debate. Some of his talent should be used to tell us what the Government are doing, because I am finding it difficult to establish the intentions behind clause 2. We seek by our amendment to clarify those intentions. The Government do not specify what they are talking about, and we are right to seek clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the comments made by the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in the latter part of his speech. He believes that owner-occupiers in Scotland supported the Conservative Party in the past but are now moving away from it. I do not know the basis for that opinion, but if he was using the seven owner-occupiers on the Opposition Benches as representative, he will find that that sample gives no criterion to justify his conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to the effect of rates on owner-occupiers and why the Government might be anxious to make changes in that sphere, the hon Gentleman gave the impression that only owner-occupiers pay rates. I know that he is aware that this is incorrect, but that point is often misunderstood in Scotland. Council tenants are just as liable for payment of rates as are other occupiers of homes in Scotland. Consequently, any changes to the benefit of ratepayers would be beneficial irrespective of the form of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the amendment before the Committee —although the hon Gentleman hardly spoke on it. I presume that it is essentially a probing amendment because its effect would be to confine a partial revaluation to domestic dwellings and not to include other categories. I am sure that that is not the Opposition's desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it may be the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon Gentleman right away that in Scotland it would not be only domestic dwellings that would be the subject of a revaluation. That indicates the Government's general approach to the matter. The primary reason for not having a revaluation is to save time and resources which may be wasted if there are substantial changes to the rating system. Some 85 per cent, of properties rated in Scotland are domestic dwellings, so that if one were not to include the domestic category in a possible revaluation postponement, little saving of time or money would be achieved. Therefore, if a postpone-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
ment or a partial postponement of any kind were announced by the Government in the forseeable future, whoever else was not included the hon Gentleman can assume that dwelling houses would not be revalued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says, but I and some of hon Friends fear not that dwelling houses would be revalued and everything else excluded but that the converse might be true—that if we assume that the whole point of this enabling power is to pave the way for rating reform, and if rating reform is to be the exclusion from the rating system of domestic properties, that might be used exclusively, as the amendment would suggest—it is a probing amendment— for domestic properties. I was seeking an assurance that other categories of property might be excluded from revaluation and to discover whether there is any possibility of the power being used exclusively for domestic property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I am entirely at one with the hon Gentleman in this. Certainly, as we understand the amendment, it would mean that if there were a partial revaluation, only domestic dwelling houses could be revalued and not any other class of property. Whatever else may be between the two sides of the Committee, I am sure that the hon Gentleman would not wish to see such an amendment accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a restrictive amendment exactly on the lines that the Minister has outlined. It was put down in the hope that the Minister would comprehensively demolish it and be able to reassure us that the lurking suspicion that these provisions will be used only to exclude domestic dwellings because of the possibility of a reform of the rating system confined to domestic ratepayers, is unfounded. We seek an assurance that there is a wider vision and, therefore, that the amendment would be damaging to that wider use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Gentleman will be satisfied at the end of the debate with the nature of the demolition work that may have been carried out as a consequence. The main questions that he asked were regarding the terms of clause 2 and whether the opportunity that the Secretary of State would have to limit valuation to particular classes of property was in any way restricted or whether it provided him with total discretion, subject to the approval of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no legal definition of what a separate class would be. It would be technically possible for the Secretary of State to ask Parliament to approve the exclusion of any of the sub-categories that the hon Gentleman referred to. There is nothing in the phrasing of the terminology that would prevent that. But, having said that, I must add that if the Government were to decide to postpone the revaluation in June 1983, or to have a partial revaluation in 1983, it would not be our intention to limit any order to certain parts of Scotland or to any sub-categories such as those referred to by the hon Gentleman. If there is a partial rather than a complete revaluation, it will be in regard to whole classes of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dunbartonshire; East (Mr. Hogg) made various comments regarding the position
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
of assessors in Scotland, and he asked specifically whether they had been consulted. There has been consultation with the Scottish assessors both on clause 2 and on the whole of part I of the Bill. There has also been consultation with COSLA and with the valuation advisory council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that because of the uncertainty of the Government's intentions these consultations have been less than helpful, at least to COSLA, which in many instances has been unable to come to any conclusions because the Minister has not been able to give adequate guidance on the Govern-' ment's thoughts on these matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. I am not aware that COSLA finds any difficulty in coming to conclusions on specific matters on which it has been consulted. It has given us its views. Clearly, those views will be taken into account when decisions are reached. There has not been the slightest suggestion to the Government that COSLA has in any way been confused by any of the proposals put to it and which are now being put before the Committee. I shall be interested to hear whether the hon Gentleman has any examples in mind. They have not been brought to our attention until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that later when we discuss the new subsection (6D) we shall be able to produce evidence of confusion in technically literate circles. I may have missed something that the Minister said, but I gather that he is ruling out any sub-division of classes. It will be a total group such as domestic, industrial or commercial. The other question I raised was on the geographical split. Perhaps the Minister could deal with that to save time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no intention of having any geographical splits in partial revaluation. Clearly, if there is to be a revaluation of properties of a particular class, it is appropriate that it should take place in the whole of Scotland or not at all. That would be a much more sensible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->0
The hon Gentleman for Garscadden also asked what the loss of revenue would be if there was a partial revaluation. There would be no loss of revenue because no revenue implications are involved. A failure to revalue would lead only to a different distribution of the rates burden within that class. Particular properties which had increased in value but which had not been revalued would be paying less than they would otherwise be paying and, presumably, other properties might be paying more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other provisions of clause 2 are designed to ensure that the overall burden of either the domestic ratepayer or of the industrial or commercial ratepayer is kept in accordance with the existing ratio, and they would therefore not be prejudiced by a partial revaluation. Clearly, if there is a total revaluation, the balance between the two might vary depending on the assessor's decision. If there is only a partial revaluation it would be inappropriate to allow that to result in a change in the ratio of the burden between the various categories. Therefore, the other provisions of the clause are designed to prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been slightly more forthcoming on this amendment, although I do not see why he could not have said some of that when we were discussing clause 1. May I take it as a categorical assurance that what we are doing here has nothing to do with the inadequacies of the current legislation on valuation? I am referring specifically to this clause and not to some of the others where there are minor adjustments on charities and so on. Both the Minister and the Secretary of State have previously pointed out that clauses 1 and 2 are basic clauses to be seen as the forerunner of any possible change in the valuation and rating system. I should like an assurance that this provision relates to the future and is not to correct any " wee anomalies on procedural points or groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a most difficult subject. I understand that in the 1975 Act there is a statutory obligation on the assessor to revalue all lands and heritages. Presumably, that is a carry-over from the 1956 Act. Our amendment is designed to extract from the Minister that this power, subject to Parliament giving approval, will enable the Government of the day to use an order to exempt from revaluation certain categories of lands and heritages. The Minister has again said that he cannot foresee circumstances in which the provision would not apply to all domestic property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a wholesale reform of the rating system, presumably there has to be an abolition of all valuation. I am not an expert on Lay field, nor do I know all the work done in this sphere in the past, but it seems that we are making heavy weather by not having a clearer indication of how the mechanics will operate. The Minister has said that the provision relates to whole classes of property and that the order will not specify power stations, bridges or oil rigs, which in recent years have been the subject of controversy over actions by assessors. I take it that we are not dealing with just the mechanics of the existing provisions. There must be some idea at the back of the Government's mind—even though it is an internal review—about which classes would be exempt in any future order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not so naive as to believe that a Bill has been produced and instructions given to the parliamentary draftsmen without somebody having some idea what it is supposed to do. I know that the draftsmen do not always get it right, but at least they try to get it right. Parliamentary draftsmen do not start drafting without instructions, so there must be some information somewhere that would enable us to make sense of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are running a risk in that they will leave doubt in the minds of owners of properties in the various classes. The biggest class is the domestic ratepayer, who the Minister has said accounts for 85 per cent. I am not sure whether he is talking about revenue or numbers. The provision may create some alarm unless we have a better idea of its intention. Does it mean that it will concern only a whole group?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what the various groups are in the current valuation. In broad categories are they only domestic, commercial and industrial? What is the percentage contribution made by public bodies, including nationalised industries? Is the Minister confirming that we are preparing the way for the abolition of domestic
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
rates? If that is so, perhaps taking these powers makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But why need that be done at this stage? Probably many would not object to an examination being made. Indeed, previous Governments have done that. If there is to be a major change in the rating system, major legislation is needed. If that is so, is that not the time to undertake a comprehensive approach? That would make both political and practical sense. Why are we doing it now, when we do not have a clear idea of what the Government hope to do in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has raised a specific question: if there is to be a major change in the rating system why should not a change of this kind be done then? Clearly, that would not achieve the purpose of saving time and resources. If no change were made now, all the assessors and other local authority officials would inevitably begin the process of revaluation at some time in the year. There is no prospect of any major legislation which changes the rating system coming before Parliament this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to extract information from the Minister. In the circumstances that he has envisaged, is it not a matter of common sense that we want valuations to be as current as possible? Surely the sheer mechanics and the size of any possible change in the rating system would require a lot of time for consultation. I am not necessarily making a party argument on this point. Would it not still be relevant for the valuations to be up-dated so that they were as current as possible, if we are thinking of leaving any local rating in existence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the valuation is purely to produce the ratable value, which is the basis on which the rates are then determined. If there were a possibility of this system of rating being abolished, there would no longer be a need to know the ratable value of properties. To avoid that sort of wasteful exercise it would be desirable not to have a revaluation if at all possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in having a valuation if there is at least a possibility that in the years immediately following that revaluation there is to be a major change which might involve the abolition of that source of local revenue or major changes in it which would make the revaluation irrelevant, unnecessary or in need of radical change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked about the major groups of classification. There is no statutory definition, and there can be many sub-groups and categories, but essentially we are talking about the domestic category, the commercial category and the industrial category. There is also a miscellaneous section which takes in some fairly minor aspects of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Including public utilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that they are included in the miscellaneous category.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another series of amendments which I hope will be useful in gathering from the Minister a good deal of information not only of interest to us immediately on the Committee but of help to some people who have a professional interest in the clause. I say that in no spirit of carping criticism or sarcasm. A number of people to whom I have talked have a genuine difficulty in comprehending the effect of clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I took the amendments in order, went very briefly through each and raised one or two questions, without becoming involved in a general philosophical debate, which may or may not develop as the discussion progresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 has largely been dealt with and I can dismiss it in a couple of sentences. It was again a matter of ruling out, as I think the Minister did on amendment No. 3, the possibility of some parts of Scotland being caught by a specification under clause 2 while others escaped. Subject to anything that the Minister may want to add, 1 think that that query has been laid to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 is substantially more important. The new subsection (6A) allows the Secretary of State to prescribe by order a method whereby the net annual value of the specified lands and heritages should be ascertained and also a method which would perform the same function for unspecified lands and heritages. Those lands and heritages which are specified will be revalued. It is envisaged that this will be done not by the normal methods with which we have been familiar in quinquennial reviews over the years, but by a new, unspecified method which will be laid down by order by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, for the unspecified lands and heritages those which under the terms of clause 2(a) would be entered in the old valuation roll—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend expand on this question of the relationship between the assessor and the Government? I have already asked that question but perhaps my hon Friend knows the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I should like to help my hon Friend, he is simply putting in a concise form one of the questions that I was about to ask the Minister. The Minister will have to fulfil the function of expanding on this point, because he is the keeper of the secrets and the repository of all information—if it exists. I say that because he has a distressing habit of saying that there is no information on any subject which we raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon Friend think it deplorable that there is no way in which hon Members can obtain this information from the Minister or from
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
anybody else? If our experience thus far is anything to go by, we shall not get any information from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a little harsh. We were given a little negative information on the last amendment, in particular, on what the clause does not mean. If we continue to receive information on what things do not mean, we may be able to make some deductions about what they do mean. That would no doubt be a satisfying process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the specified properties to be revalued there may be a method prescribed by the Secretary of State, which presumably will be a departure from accepted and established principle. That is the one point that is clear. Secondly, I understood that unspecified properties would be entered at their figure on the old valuation roll, or on the basis of the figures under which they would fall to be entered on the old valuation roll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also told that there may be a new method of valuation. That seems a little contradictory. I hope that I am not being thick or obtuse, but I understood that the whole point of the unspecified categories was as is given in the new proviso to subsection (3) of the 1975 Act:
	<br><blockquote><p>" heritages not falling within a class specified in the order shall, for the purposes of the new valuation roll, be taken to be—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the same as was entered in the old valuation roll … if no such value was so entered, the value which would properly fall to be entered in the old valuation roll in respect of them if that roll were still in force."</p></blockquote>
If that is so, I cannot see why we need the possibility of a new method of valuation to be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Obviously it is not clear, as presumably I have got it wrong, but it seems as clear as a pikestaff from that proviso that the whole point of those heritages not being specified is that we hammer them in under the old system, and, indeed, under the old figure—if it exists. If that is so, it is beyond me to know what is the meaning of the new subsection (6A) 	<i>(b):</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>" such a method as regards the unspecified lands and heritages."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon Gentleman at this stage, because this is a technical point. The point to which he refers in the addition to subsection (3) 	<i>(a)</i> is how the net annual value of properties will be determined. In the case of those that are being revalued, the revaluation will determine them. For those not being revalued, the arrangements are given in subparagraph (ii) of the proviso. Once the net annual value has been determined, the new subsection (6A) describes how the Secretary of State may adjust the net annual value that has thereby been decided, in order to preserve the ratio between the various categories of subjects affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the actual rates liability that will ultimately be borne by the individual classes will depend on their net annual value as adjusted by the Secretary of State to preserve the ratio between those properties that have been revalued and those that have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: make no apology for saying that I shall read the Minister's words later and make sure that I comprehend them. However, I shall explain the point in my terms and the Under-Secretary can tell me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
whether I have got it right. If I have, it will be of considerable consolation to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Heritages which have not been specified, and therefore will not be revalued, will enter the new valuation role at the same figure at which they were on the old valuation role. Alternatively, if the heritages were not on the old valuation role, they will appear at a figure calculated as if the old valuation role were being made up again. That is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
am We then come to new subsection (6A), which states
	<br><blockquote><p>" Where the Secretary of State makes an order under subparagraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a) above, he may prescribe by order under this subsection (either or both)— 	<i>(a)</i> a method whereby the net annual value of the specified lands and heritages shall be adjusted for the purposes of ascertaining their rateable value."—</p></blockquote>
we are not concerned about that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) such a method as regards the unspecified lands and heritages."</p></blockquote>
I take it that (6A)() does not mean what it says. If it were given to my 15-year-old daughter as a comprehension piece for her O-level English, she would take the words "such a method" to refer to the method whereby net annual value was devised under (6A)(a). If that is not the intention—I make this point in no frivolous spirit— it ought to be changed by amendments, perhaps on Report, to make its meaning clear. Undoubtedly, we would be glad to allow such amendments to pass through easily, because they would be technical and clarifying. I am sure that future generations would take (6A)(b) to mean what I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman will see that in new subsection (6A) the introductory words include the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>" he may prescribe by order under this subsection (either or both)".</p></blockquote>
If, for example, the Secretary of State were to use a multiplication factor, he might not need to change to the other category. If, on the other hand, he were using the alternative procedure, of dividing the figures, to which the notes or clauses refer, that would be equally sufficient for his purpose. But in theory it is possible for him to use a combined system of a partial multiplication or partial division. It is unlikely that he would use a combined system but that option would be available if, after consultation with the relevant bodies—the clause provides for such consultation— that was seen to be a more sensible way of approaching the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand what the Minister is saying and what is the intention of this part of the clause. When I stumble into the land of multipliers and dividers—I expect that at any moment the GDP deflator will walk round the corner—I feel a little lost. But perhaps the Minister will look at the phraseology. I think that many of us reading the clause would take the word "such" in new subsection (6A) 	<i>(b)</i> as referring to the method in (6A) 	<i>(a).</i> In other words, we can prescribe either method or both methods for the net annual value and (6A) 	<i>(b)</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessarily the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily the same, but I think that it ought to be clarified. I took it that way, and some assessors' staff with whom I have discussed the matter have taken it to mean what I have suggested. What is confusing is what the word "such" refers to, and to what extent it is narrowly defined and exclusive to the process described in (6A) (a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the hon Gentleman's point. If one were to use both methods 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b),</i> as opposed to either, he is concerned that the way in which new subsection (6A) 	<i>(b)</i> has been worded might require method 	<i>(a)</i> also to be used in method 	<i>(b),</i> even if there were no logical reason for doing so. We shall certainly look at the drafting to see whether that would happen. If that were the consequence it might be inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With the Minister's assurance that he will look at the drafting, I shall hurry on. I shall read what the Minister said to see whether I am making a mountain out of a molehill. I think that this interchange illustrates the complexity and perhaps the somewhat opaque quality of the language which has been dreamt up by the draftsmen. I believe that it could be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the important questions raised by the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). He asked why we need this power to prescribe a new method and what will be the effect of that new method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may illustrate my problem in this way. As a matter of theoretical speculation, could the new method be a total and radical departure from the system which has operated in previous revaluations? For example, for domestic property, could we move from a rental basis to a capital basis when making the revaluation? If we are to stick with the rental basis, could we move away from the concept of a balanced market? I know that Conservative politicians are fond of balanced markets, but they have moved away from them before—in the tenants' rights Act, for example, where a "free market" is not a willing seller and a willing buyer but merely a willing buyer and a forced seller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might have all sorts of new concepts introduced into the assessors' traditional working arrangements. I am anxious to hear from the Minister whether radical departures of that nature are envisaged and, if so, what are the parameters of that innovatory process and why it is thought necessary. I can see why it might be said "Let's simplify things and stop revaluation, which takes an enormous amount of work in the information-gathering process over a lengthy period, because it will all be redundant when certain things in the legislative programme of reform happen before all that work would take effect." That is a simple concept with which I can sympathise and which I understand. But if we are stopping all that work being done because it will not be necessary, why is it necessary to take powers to prescribe by order totally different methods of valuing for properties that are to be revalued? Presumably, it is because that revaluation is relevant and will not be affected at the end of the day by any legislative changes, rating reform and so on that are to come forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is in some confusion here. Nothing is proposed, nor could there be anything
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
proposed, for changing the system whereby the assessors determine what is the net annual value of properties. The only change proposed is as follows. At present, once the net annual value of a property is fixed that is automatically equivalent to its ratable value. However, where the net annual value has been fixed it may be highly desirable from everyone's point of view for that to be adjusted before reaching the ratable value, in order to preserve the balance between classes that have been revalued and those that have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has been well worth while, because I had not appreciated that, and a large number of other people had not appreciated the importance of the word "adjusted". I see that the Minister is looking for—and getting—confirmatory nods, which I find reassuring. Therefore, the key word is "adjusted".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may clarify matters in my mind. New subsection (6A)(a) states that the Secretary of State may prescribe:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a method whereby the net annual value of the specified lands and heritages shall be adjusted for the purposes of ascertaining their ratable value."</p></blockquote>
We categorically rule out the words that the statute would not allow, any change in the method whereby the net annual value will be reached by the assessor. Therefore, there can be no possibility of rating reform by the back door without proper parliamentary scrutiny. If I have that matter clear, I am grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. He will see that new subsection (6A)(a) is specifically restricted to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a method whereby the net annual value … shall be adjusted for the purposes of ascertaining their ratable value."</p></blockquote>
That is the only purpose for which this method would be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that, and now understand the point. It is only to allow technical adjustments on the translation from NAV to RV, and it is only to allow those technical adjustments for the purposes of the mysteries that are involved in new subsection (6B), which I suspect will make everything that we have been talking about absolutely simple. I am happy to leave the matter at that, as our discussion has genuinely cleared my mind and removed some of the more suspicious thoughts that I might have been harbouring about that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come, with no great pleasure, to amendment No. 6, which, for the purposes of getting explanation and information, seeks to remove the new subsection (6B). I believe that the meaning of new subsection (6B) is the most puzzling to the layman of all the parts of this proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may save time if I briefly explain to the Minister how I see the shape of the clause. As I have come to the conclusion that it is almost meaningless I obviously have it wrong. Therefore, I need information that will correct my impression. I understand the clause to say that where properties are specified they shall be revalued. We now know that their net annual value will be revalued according to the traditional methods carried out by the assessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those lands and heritages not to be specified, therefore not to be revalued, will go on at the old figure from the old roll, or will be added to the new roll as though
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
they were being added to the new roll under the old arrangements. I think that that is all fairly clear. There may be a scheme, under new subsection (6A), for technical adjustments to be made between the net annual value and the ratable value which will allow this famous ratio to be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to new subsection (6B), which appears to say that we must keep the same ratio throughout Scotland between the different classes of property—we know that they are total classes—such as commercial or domestic. I take "ratio" to mean that industrial revenue will be the same percentage of the total as that raised under the previous system—the old revaluation. Obviously the commercial and domestic properties will raise the same proportion. Therefore, the global sum may change. The components within domestic, commercial or industrial categories may change. In other words, a property may give more or less, but the proportion of the total will remain the same. For example, if 50 per cent, of the Scottish total comes from the domestic element, 50 per cent, of the new ratable value total will also come from domestic property, 30 per cent, from industrial, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made clear how I understand the clause. No doubt in a minute or two I shall hear from the Minister whether that is correct or whether I am overlooking important and interesting points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter has worried a great number of people, and I am sure that the Minister will want to allay their fears. Some of us wonder about the point of the process. Presumably the whole point of a revaluation—there may be a number of points, but there is only one principal point, as I understand it—is that it should allow a readjustment between the various classes and sections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Tuesday's debate I quoted the variation that there had been between the last two "quinquennial" reviews. One was not quinquennial, as I pointed out, and therefore the movement between classes had been particularly large, being exaggerated by the long wait. Undoubtedly, even in a normal quinquennial there may be considerable adjustment. Industrial rates may go up by 200 per cent, while domestic rates may go up by only 150 per cent. One can go on varying possibilities on that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me—though I may be wrong—that in this clause there is clearly no possibility, because of new subsection (6B), of altering the ratio between the various classes. That seems to be extraordinary, because the whole point of keeping to regular quinquennial revaluations is to allow that readjustment to take place. That is the case made by assessors and Ministers over the years. I do not understand why we have new subsection (6B) added, because it will stop that adjustment, which surely is one of the main, and basic, reasons for having a revaluation at all. I am genuinely puzzled by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we removed new subsection (6B) and did not have the provision about ratio, we could, 1 presume, still use these provisions to stop an unnecessary revaluation. I agree that—as I suppose the Minister will tell me—the argument then is that one will find that the rates of a person whose property has not been revalued will decline sharply as a percentage of the total. That leaves the difficulty that the clause will give such a person an enormous artificial advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this seems to be a dangerous importation because —if the Minister is worrying about work—we are going through the enormous problem of a major revaluation and yet we cannot make any adjustments between the various classes. That is one of the most important parts of a revaluation. Without making a final judgment on the matter, I feel that it undermines much of the point of the revaluation principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say also in passing—this is a small point, but I believe that it should be raised now so that the Minister may comment—that if one is to preserve the ratios, it is difficult to know the final outcome which allows one to calculate the ratio. I presume that it can be done on a fairly rough guess by taking the assessor's provisional figures and ignoring the possibility of appeals. But clearly, appeals will arise from the new revaluation. As we know from the 1978 revaluation, appeals have continued for about three years. Indeed, the recent figures that I have seen show that there were 109,868 appeals arising out of that revaluation. Therefore, it is a long time before one can know the exact final figures which will allow one to judge the possible ratio. I put that to the Minister in general terms only, because there may be some technical difficulties that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware also of the problem of unspecified lands and heritages which will not be revalued. If, for example, all domestic properties were not to be revalued and were to be slotted into the new valuation roll at exactly the same figure as they were on the old one, how should one adjust the changes in rental value which would be normally reflected in changes in the rateable value of individual properties? Presumably, change would occur because someone had built a new wing or put in central heating. However, if, during a normal revaluation, one looked at No. 15 Smith Street and saw that the twee 	<i>House and Garden</i> improvers had moved in so that the notional rent on which the rateable value would be normally based had gone up sharply, could one still adjust the rateable value, when the clause says that it must be put in at exactly the old rateable value in the last quinquennium? The Minister is looking puzzled. I shall have to try again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely apologise for delaying the Committee. Let us suppose that there is a category of property which will not be revalued under the operation of clause 2. The figure for that category will therefore go into the new valuation roll and be taken to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"the same as was entered in the old valuation roll ".</p></blockquote>
That figure was reached at least five years previously and during those five long years there may have been a distinct shift in housing fashion. Many middle-class families may have moved into working-class areas, forcing up property values and the notional rentals on which ratable values are based. Improvements would have resulted and general values increased. It has not occurred through shortage, which would be a balanced market consideration. Improvements have resulted, and general values have increased. Might that not affect the assessor's decision if the clause did not tie him to using the old ratable value?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we have flexibility in the domestic sphere without revaluation? To have no flexibility, and no possibility of flexibility, is surely grossly unfair to
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
people paying too much as a proportion of the share borne by the domestic element? I hope that the Minister follows my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: think that I know what the hon Gentleman is asking about. However, I cannot see the problem. Properties that do not appear on the valuation roll are almost invariably those that have been constructed since the valuation roll was completed. Such properties will be in exactly the same position as they are now. Without any question of revaluation arising, the net annual value of a newly constructed building is determined on the principles that would have applied had that building been available for consideration when the valuation roll was compiled. No change is envisaged in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With new buildings the situation is simple enough—I can see that. I seem to be making rather heavy weather of asking this question. Let me try to put it simply. If the clause were in operation and domestic property were not specified for revaluation, the inevitable consequence would be frozen ratable values for all domestic properties. What happens if considerable variations in circumstance, which would normally have meant a change in their ratable value vis-a-vis their neighbours or other domestic properties, affect individual houses? We should be freezing individual ratable values of houses in unspecified groups of heritages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the change is such that it would at present lead to an increase in the ratable value irrespective of any general revaluation, that will continue to apply. If, however, it is a change that would not at present lead to any change in ratable value until the next general revaluation, that, equally, would apply exactly as it does now. The hon Gentleman is correct in that the effect of postponing a revaluation would be to delay adjustments as to the appropriate burden of ratable value within a class.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have got there—laboriously, and helping each other along. The provision will mean that there will be no adjustments within the non-specified class. Someone in a building with a high ratable value, which would have become comparatively smaller because of rises in ratable values for houses in other parts of the domestic group, will continue to bear an unfair proportion when the rate poundage is applied, because we have frozen in aspic the valuations of five years ago. That may be tolerable if rating reform follows within a year, but if the situation is to be left for two or three years it will lead to serious difficulty and disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister explains the system in simple terms, as no doubt he will, perhaps he will say a word or two about how the ratio can be preserved. Let us take the figures for the 1978 revaluation and assume that there is revaluation of industrial but not domestic property—a plausible assumption. Let us assume that the revaluation of industrial property would have added a considerable sum to the combined rateable value of the sector. If the total of individual domestic rateable values is frozen, there will be quite a gap to bridge if the ratio is to be preserved. Will the Ministers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
say how that is to be done if industrial rateable values, because they are being revalued, are hoicked up, whereas domestic rateable values, because they are not specified, are frozen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has assured us that the assessor will use the same criteria as have been used in the past. Only after the NAV stage has been reached can he interfere and make a technical adjustment. It follows from that as night follows day that there may be a considerable increase in the specified areas and no increase, by definition, in the unspecified areas. That adjustment will be considerable. We are entitled to know exactly what machinery is envisaged for the purpose. The matter is clear enough and we can all understand the point that is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now hurriedly, and with guilt at having taken so long, to amendment No. 10. It is almost an addendum to the main subject that we have been discussing and deals with a sweeping and remarkable right to repeal the Act—if the Bill becomes one—or any other Act if they are in the way of the operation of clause 2. I recognise that there is always a balance between constitutional niceties and expediency and the need to operate machinery effectively, but it seems to me that the powers given in new subsection (6D) are remarkably sweeping:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order under this subsection … repeal or amend any enactment (including this Act) in so fas as that enactment relates to the valuation of lands and heritages and such valuation is affected by an order under subparagraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (3)(a), or under subsection (6A), above."</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to that because we have had assurances from the Minister that, at present at least, and as the Bill is drawn—and as the Act will state when it reaches the statute book, if that happens— there can be no interference with the assessor's independence. It is only a matter of adjustment between net annual value and rateable value. As I have said, that removed one of my major fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the sweeping powers in new subsection (6D) would allow the Secretary of State, merely by order, to return to the position which I thought might be implied by the phraseology of new subsection (6A). I believe that there is a case for examining the matter. I am perfectly open-minded about it and prepared to listen to the Minister, but the powers seem to be Draconian and rather surprising. At present I have a sneaking sympathy with the seriousness of my amendment, which would remove that power and force the Minister to draft something a little less arbitrary and more acceptable to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised a fair number of points. Some of the answers that I have received during our interchanges have been reassuring. I thought that there could be a substantial threat to the assessor's independence in the Secretary of State's right to prescribe methods under new subsection (6A). If we are given a reassurance about new subsection (6D), perhaps my fears will prove to have been exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister examines some of the representations that have been made he will see how those fears have been shared by others. On the basis of the present drafting, they have been held by people who are much more expert in the matter than I am. I read from one of those representations, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"of course, as framed, the legislation could be used for many types of manipulation of the valuation system."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
I note that the Central regional council in a memorandum which was sent to its members—it has not gone to all the members of this Committee, but I do not believe that the council would object to my quoting from it—said, when referring to the assessors, that the Bill's provisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"would appear to impinge upon the traditional impartiality with which they have previously undertaken their professional duties."</p></blockquote>
So there are widespread fears among those who operate the system about the impact of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder, particularly in view of the necessity to maintain the ratio—although I accept that without it things would become unworkable; and vitiated as matters are by the need to have the apparent contradiction built in—whether the game is worth the candle. There is to be a monstrously complicated piece of machinery, the purpose of which is only to guard against the possibility, if the timing is wrong, of some revaluations being carried out unnecessarily. With all its inherent complexity and apparent contradictions, should it not be quietly shoved on side and forgotten about? The Minister should consider the matter very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that in a letter from the Finance Division of the Scottish Office, to Mr. Speirs, the COSLA official, a Mr. J. E. Fraser, referring to clauses 1 and 2, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These provisions will not in themselves disturb the quinquennial principle. Unless the new powers are exercised, the next revaluation will take place."</p></blockquote>
That is a remarkable insight into the Government's intention. Of course, unless the powers are exercised the next revaluation will take place. But if the Minister wants to upset that position, he has clause 1, which he can use if he needs to. Clause 1 would presumably give him breathing space to bring in quickly the rating or other general reform that he wants.

Given the alarms to which I have referred and the anxieties which undoubtedly exist among assessors, local government personnel, officials and elected members, I think that this particularly labyrinthal and complex clause is not worth all the effort and worry that it will represent. While I wait with interest to hear what the Minister will say about the detailed points that we have raised, I suggest that he might consider whether at the end of the day he should not quietly drop the clause overboard with a soft and unlamented plop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by completely absolving the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) from any criticism of the length of his speech, and I accept that the complexity of the clause justifies the time which he has devoted to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 seeks to ensure that any partial revaluation which the Secretary of State may wish to propose through an order should apply to the whole of Scotland. As I said earlier, I fully accept the principle of what the hon Gentleman is saying. Indeed, in the light of his amendment, it is clearly desirable that the Bill should be amended to reflect that requirement. However, his amendment by itself would not meet that requirement, because it merely says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any such order shall apply throughout Scotland." </p></blockquote>
It does not prevent that order being discriminatory in its effect in different parts of Scotland. I see that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
hon Gentleman accepts that point. But I accept the principle of the Opposition amendment and undertake to consider bringing forward an amendment to meet the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the more complex aspects of the hon Gentleman's speech and to the way in which new subsections (6A) and (6B) would operate. We are dealing here purely with the hypothetical situation that a partial revaluation might take place—that the revaluation of certain properties might proceed whereas that of other properties might be postponed. The purpose of these provisions is simply that, if there were to be a partial revaluation, it would clearly increase the rateable value of those properties that had been revalued, since the inevitable effect of any revaluation is to revalue upwards. If, therefore no adjustment were made those classes of property that had been subject to the revaluation would find that their net annual value and their rateable value were substantially increased, whereas those properties that had been exempted from the revaluation or for which revaluation was postponed would have no such increases so that relatively speaking their share of any rates burden would be significantly and perhaps even dramatically, reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly that would be unfair because it would lead to a consequence which was not intended and which would not be acceptable. Therefore it is essential that some adjustment be made to ensure that that does not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman pointed out correctly that one of the purposes of a revaluation is to make changes in the distribution of the rates burden as between different classes of rateable property because of changes in circumstances or other factors which justify such a change. But an additional purpose of a revaluation which is equally important is to permit a readjustment of the burden within a particular class by updating the rateable value or the net annual value of the property concerned. Therefore there can still be significant advantage in going ahead with the revaluation of a particular class of properties. It will at least ensure that the rate burden is properly and fairly distributed between the different dwelling houses or commercial properties that fall within that class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new subsection (6A) is to ensure that, were the Secretary of State to make an order under the clause permitting a partial revaluation there would be a method whereby the net annual value could be adjusted for the purpose of achieving the rateable value in order to preserve the proper ratio between the different classes of property. I undertake again to consider the wording of new subsection (6A) so that I can assure the hon Gentleman that there is no danger of ambiguity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (6A) does not specify how the ratio between those properties that had been revalued and those classes of property that had not been revalued would be preserved. That is where we turn to new subsection (6B) which the hon Gentleman's amendment would remove. Without new subsection (6B) it could be that if the Secretary of State adjusted the net annual value to take account of a partial revaluation, he could do so in such a way as to shift the burden of a particular class of property. That would be unfair and unacceptable. If certain properties have not been the subject of a revaluation, it is quite unfair that their
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
relative share of the rate burden should change simply because of an adjustment by the Secretary of State. New subsection (6B) is essential in order to ensure that, whatever method is chosen the proportion of the rate burden, or the rateable value burden, borne by individual classes of property is not changed by a partial revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked what kind of method might be applied to achieve this purpose. I can give him some information about the options but I should first like to draw his attention to new subsection (6C) which specifically states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before prescribing a method"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, before coming to a conclusion on such a method—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall consult the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council and any association of local authorities which appears to him to represent the interests of local authorities in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
No conclusion would be reached until that consultation had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially there would be two possible options, or a combination of two possibilities. The order made under the new subsection could provide for either a multiplying factor to be applied to the values of unspecified lands and heritages or alternatively, a dividing factor to be applied to the values of specified lands and heritages. Those bare words may not be very enlightening, so I shall explain them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the lands have been specified that means that they have been the subject of the revaluation and therefore their net annual values and consequent rateable values are likely to have increased considerably. If their values have increased considerably then in order to preserve the ratio between them and those properties that have not been revalued one would need a dividing factor to reduce what would otherwise be their burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If on the other hand, the lands and heritages were unspecified—in other words, were not revalued—then without an adjustment their share of the rates burden would be substantially less than it would otherwise have been, and therefore in their case a multiplying factor would be required to preserve the ratio. One could therefore use a multiplying factor, a dividing factor or a combination of the two. The decision will be taken, as the Bill specifies, after consultation with the valuation advisory council, COSLA and any other relevant body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that I am entering dangerous waters, Mr. Gourlay, but there is a point I should like to make. The Minister sets great store by the consultations. If the multiplier or divider required was evident from the statistics anyway, would not the consultations be meaningless? The people involved would be talking about something that was already decided by a clear interpretation of the statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some truth in what the hon Gentleman says, in so far as we are talking of a technical calculation whose purposes have already been established—to preserve the ratio. There may indeed be procedural or administrative advantages or disadvantages in applying either a multiplier or a divider, or a combination of the two. It seems sensible, before coming to a conclusion on that point, which we need not do at this stage, to seek the advice of those who will be affected by it. That is what the clause provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes the point seem so simple that even I can understand it. But it seems to me to be so simple as to have no purpose if we are not to alter the ratio, which is presumably the whole purpose of the exercise. Subsection (6B) provides that the Secretary of State shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"preserve the ratio which he estimates will exist immediately before."</p></blockquote>
I am not quite sure that I agree with my hon Friend on the interpretation of those words. There must be some purpose in all this malarky. It is concerned with changing the valuations and the ratio. If we are talking about using multipliers and divisors to get back to the position that we started from, it does not make sense to me. There is something missing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain it to the hon Gentleman in this way. The impartial revaluation of certain classes of property has the immediate effect that within the class that has been revalued, as a consequence of the revaluation, there will be an internal redistribution of the rating burden to take account of the increases or decreases in value of properties within that class. If, for example, the domestic sector were being revalued, although the ratio between domestic and commercial might be being preserved, there would still be the opportunity to increase or decrease the ratable values of particular dwelling houses, depending on the change in circumstances since the last revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, if the industrial and commercial properties were being, evalued and dwelling houses were not, this provision would still enable the changes in value of different factories and different commercial premises— as opposed to other factories or other commercial premises—since the previous revaluation to be taken into account. Therefore, substantial changes are caused, even if there is a partial revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not with the Minister. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that we are talking of a ratio of 85 per cent, domestic, 10 per cent, commercial and 5 per cent, industrial. I do not know whether that is right, but it gives nice, simple, round figures. The Minister seems to be saying that we shall not change these ratios, and that, irrespective of whether they are specified or unspecified, we shall end up with the same ratios. That is how I understand the matter. The Minister then said that, within that 85 per cent, domestic proportion, facilities are available to alter the relationship or the ratio between one house and another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Specified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether they are specified or not, this is where I am getting into difficulties. I do not think that assessors work their figures out with the idea that industrial or commercial properties are getting away with too much. Assessing is not a science in that sense. But it so happens that when assessors go over the individual properties for revaluation they throw up the figures that my hon Friend has referred to for the past two revaluations. If that is not to be permitted under the next revaluation, whenever it may be, what is the purpose of this exercise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could clarify the figure of 85
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
per cent. It is the percentage of the properties entered on the valuation roll which are domestic dwellings. It is not the proportion of rateable value, but the proportion of total properties entered on the roll which are ordinary individuals' domestic properties. For the balance of the burden of rateable values, the figures— which are approximate—show that the domestic element represents 36.7 per cent, of total rateable values; the commercial sector 27.3 per cent.; the industrial sector 12.5 per cent.; and miscellaneous 23.5 per cent. That is the existing ratio. If there were a total revaluation, that could change, depending on the decisions reached by individual assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, there were a partial revaluation, whatever classes were being revalued, it would clearly be iniquitous that, simply because some classes had been revalued and others not, the total ratio should change, because it might be that if every class were revalued that would not emerge from a total revaluation. Therefore, the purpose of the clause is to ensure that the ratio between the different classes is preserved. But even if there is partial revaluation there will still be achieved within each class that is specified, and therefore revalued, an internal redistribution of rateable value burden on the basis that the assessor determines in the traditional way. That is the way in which the system would work, depending on the observations of the bodies consulted, and it would be either a multiplier or divisor factor or some combination of both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Amendment No. 10 would allow by affirmative resolution certain changes to be made in certain statutory provisions. This is not a new kind of provision; there is a very close precedent in legislation that was passed by the Labour Government for similar reasons. The precedent is section 6(5) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1978 in the context of orders providing for the valuation by formula of public undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that at this stage it is impossible to know many of the consequential technical statutory amendments that might be required if there were to be such a partial revaluation. And, as the Labour Government concluded in respect of public undertakings, it is much more sensible when dealing only with consequential technical amendments to do that at the appropriate time by affirmative order. That was the system proposed by the Labour Government. I do not think that it was opposed then, and I am not aware that anyone has taken exception to dealing with it in this way as regards these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon Gentleman and his hon Friends that here we are concerned with consequential changes that would be appropriate if there were to be a postponement or partial revaluation. There are the precedents of the 1975 Act and the 1978 Act, which was brought forward for similar reasons in a similar way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are any other detailed points I shall be happy to answer them. 1 summarise by saying that the Government are happy to accept in principal Opposition amendment No. 4 and undertake to bring forward an amendment to achieve its effect. The others are, I suspect, substantially probing amendments, but I will be happy to deal with any further points that hon Members might wish to raise in relation to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for replying in detail to the points raised by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). It is right that he should reply to any point made by any member of the Committee, because this issue is so incredibly complicated that it would be impossible for members of the Committee or anyone outside to make much sense of what was happening unless we kept the flow of debate going in this respect. Following the Minister's last intervention, it seems clear enough that these provisions are likely to make the rating system so obscure, with its multiplier and divisor factors, that not only will ratepayers not understand, but, I suspect, assessors will not understand either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am alarmed by the scope that the Government give themselves in clause 2, in particular in those parts of the clause that my hon Friends seek to amend. Therefore, I support the restrictive amendments which they have tabled. Indeed, I believe that it is probably right that hon Members should support amendments or measures that will restrict the power of control of Ministers, particularly the Ministers who are presently in power in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of detailed worries. In particular, I am concerned about the Government's intentions in respect of the sweeping new powers which they seek in the clause. The Minister told us that it was not his intention to discriminate on a geographical basis through the powers in the clause. If that is so, one wonders why on earth he is seeking powers that, technically, would enable him to discriminate on a geographical basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon Gentleman was not listening to my answer. I have accepted the Opposition amendment, which seeks to make that position clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: was listening to the hon Gentleman on this occasion. Perhaps I was outside having a cup of coffee on the earlier occasion when he made that point. However, I certainly welcome that fact. Like the Minister, I represent part of the Lothian region, and many of us in that area are very concerned about the vendetta which the Government and the Secretary of State are having with Lothian regional council, as we believe that this could lead to difficulties for many of our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the points covered in the amendments. It is reasonable to speculate about what the Government propose to do with the significant new powers they seek in sub-paragraph (i) of the new proviso, which states:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"only such classes of lands and heritages as may be specified in the order shall be so valued or revalued".</p></blockquote>
What classes of lands and heritages does the Minister intend to mess around with? [An hon Member: "Agriculture"]. Agriculture has already been derated, and derating is a subject to which I wish to move. That is the sort of principle that we are moving into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing the Secretary of State, I think that he may feel moved to delay the revaluation of breweries. That could be of assistance to some of my constitutents in Dunbar, where the Belhaven brewery is sited, and to many other areas where there are breweries, distilleries or any of a number of classes of industrial or domestic heritages. He may even have in mind sporting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Imagine the friends he might be able to cultivate in certain traditionally Tory areas if he were to derate or delay revaluation of grouse moors. The scope for speculation in this sphere is probably endless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point on which I wish to press the Minister, because I believe it is relevant and topical. Could the criteria in the clause be used by the assessor in order to discriminate on the directions of the Secretary of State between owner-occupied housing and tenanted housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear again that there is nothing proposed that will in any way change the way in which the assessor operates or determines ratable values. There are no powers among those being taken by the Secretary of State which would in any way affect the assessor in carrying out his function of determining the net annual value of a property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what worries me. As I have already made clear in the Committee, I believe that the existing rating system does not make any sense, and I will be satisfied only if radical reforms can be brought into effect. However, I had better not pursue that line, Mr. Gourlay, because you will once again and quite rightly call me to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the criteria at present used by assessors have tended to lead them to fix higher ratable values for owner-occupied property than tenanted property. That is an irrefutable fact, I should have thought. If revaluation proceeds on that basis it could give rise to tenants who buy their council houses having higher rates to pay—quite rightly—than those who do not. That is an interesting point on which to speculate, because many Opposition Members have been advising our constituents who are council house tenants to remain so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing the lengths to which this Government are prepared to go, and have already gone, in order to bribe people to purchase their council houses, through discounts, and so on, I believe that it might just be possible under these provisions for the Secretary of State to remove the owner-occupied housing classification from a revaluation. That would make it possible for him to discriminate against council tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman ought to consider such allegations before he makes them. He should be aware that, apart from anything else, the assessor has not the slightest way of knowing whether a property is owned by the person living in it or whether it is privately or publicly rented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come off it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a way, perhaps the hon Gentleman or his hon Friends can tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessor in the Borders region certainly knows whether my house is rented, because only last week I filled in the valuation return on which I gave him that information. I assume that other tenants and owners of property will have provided that information. The Miniter cannot get away with that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend will know that in the rating review there are many interesting facts. The ratable values on a number of domestic properties are broken down between various bands and categories, one of which is local authority housing. Clearly, that information is therefore available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend for that information. It emphasises the fact that the Secretary of State will have the power, if by some misfortune the Bill is enacted, to discriminate against council house tenants in the way that I have in mind. That is a point of some concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister does not feel that I am being too hard on him, because he is the nice guy at the Scottish Office, and it is curious that the acknowledged wet at the Scottish Office should always be called upon to present these particularly vicious pieces of legislation to the House. Perhaps the Secretary of State thinks that it is easier for the Minister to do so than his hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher). But that is a point which is probably out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other area on which we require clarification is that of derating. Will those local authorities which find the ratable value of properties within their area reduced following decisions taken by the Secretary of State under the powers contained in this clause be compensated by the Government? We have experienced this problem particularly in rural areas where agricultural property has been derated. The rating base of many rural local authorities has been substantially reduced. I recognise that, theoretically, local authorities are compensated for that through the resources element of the rate support grant, but many local authorities feel that it is not done satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State takes advantage of these powers to delay revaluation of a certain category of land or heritage and thereby reduces the rating base of certain types of local authority—for example, he might decide to delay the revaluation of grouse moors—will he compensate the Highlands regional council by increasing the rate support grant to make good that loss?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon Gentleman that there is nothing in the provisions which allows for any further derating of certain classes of property. As for differentials, the next Opposition amendment—No. 7— which proposes to preserve the ratio in local valuation areas, relates to that matter. Perhaps we can consider it when we come to that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In confess that I am still not clear about new subsections (6A) and (6B), but I would prefer to study the problem and, depending upon how we get on, perhaps come back to it on clause stand part. I make no apology for repeating that it is probably the second most important clause in this part of the Bill. I am certainly not trying to delay the Committee, but I find the problem disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister has accepted the principle of the first amendment, so that anything that applies will cover the whole of Scotland and not one valuation area only. However, I am still uncertain about the purposes of new subsections (6A) and (6B)
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
and how they will work in relation to each other within the categories of lands and heritage, as the Minister tried to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (6D) contains Draconian powers to be given by negative procedure—it is not particularly effective. It gives the Secretary of State power to repeal or amend any enactment, including this Bill when it is passed, which relates to the valuation of land and heritages. I cannot see any Government asking for those powers unless some major change is contemplated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman must appreciate that these powers are identical to those which, as a Minister in the Scottish Office, he sought in 1975 and 1978 for exactly the same reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman mean that new subsection (6D) is really a carry-over? Why is it needed in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that the previous Government sought similar powers to allow certain consequential statutory changes to be made by order, in respect of valuation of public undertakings. It was in a different class of valuation, but the type of power sought is identical to that aimed at by the previous Government for exactly the same sort of reasons, in that in dealing with minor consequential changes, which cannot be identified at this stage, it is more sensible to do that through the order system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: shall accept that. I never presume to remember all that I did as a Minister, never mind what other Ministers did in the Scottish Office. I have no doubt that it is a standard technical bit to include in certain Acts. It just seems to me that unspecified major upheavals in the rating system lie behind clauses 1 and 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that so far we have not had one cheep or question from a single Government Minister. I do not think that they are any brighter than I am, and therefore I do not assume that they understand everything about the matter. I am not unduly suspicious of Governments; I think that mine is a healthy open suspicion. We are talking about a major upheaval, and there has been no assurance other than the statement that whatever applies will cover everybody in a category. No assurance has been given that it will not be to the advantage or disadvantage of certain categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that a Government want to take powers; that is fair enough. But I wish to return to my main point—that I am disturbed about powers being taken when we do not know the intention behind them, although it is possible that we would agree with that intention. Therefore, I hope that, either now or on Report, we shall return to the Government's general principle. I dare say that if we spent enough time on the matter I should understand its technicalities, but I am concerned about the principles. I am certainly not happy with what the Government seem to be doing. I do not imagine that it is worth voting on the amendments. But I am worried, and I shall read what has been said about the amendments with great care. They have been important in probing what lies behind the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to ask the hon Gentleman a question: is there anything in clause 2 or any other part of the Bill that would allow the Secretary of State to alter the existing classes of land or definitions of heritage in any way differently from existing powers? It seems to me that the import of the hon Gentleman's remarks was that there might be an opportunity through the partial revaluation process to alter existing classes of valuation.

I can give the Committee an assurance that the conspiracy theory is only a theory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be helpful, as the Minister has been unable to give reasons—although he has dealt well with technicalities—for him to tell us from where came the initiative that gave the Government the inspiration to include the clause in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As a general principle, I have always been in favour of agricultural land being rated. If there has to be some compensating factor by way of income, there are plenty of subsidies available for that. I do not believe that the world would come to an end if, for simplification, agricultural land were brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point because I do not want the NFU or anybody else to think that there is any ambiguity on the matter. Is there anything in the powers that could bring in agricultural land, or would that have to be done by some other amending legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in these powers which could make any properties which are not at present subject to rating subject to rating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition will not push the amendments at this stage, although, obviously, we may raise the matter on clause stand part. In regard to amendment No. 4, we accept the Minister's undertaking that there will be a drafting amendment on Third Reading, and in regard to amendment No. 5 we are grateful to him for his assurance that he will reexamine the wording of new subsection (6A) to see whether there is a need for further clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still not satisfied about the Government's motives for clause 1 or that part of clause 2 which we have already examined. Were it not for the fact that we rapidly agreed the sittings motion some time ago it might have been appropriate for us to delay the proceedings until the Government had decided on their intentions, when perhaps we could have had a clearer debate. However, we still return to the point that if the Government have made up their mind we would be most grateful to know. Some of our amendments would have more point because we would know what are the exact purposes of these parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I wish to make a very quick point, as I believe that the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) was accusing me of scare-mongering. I simply draw the attention of the hon Gentleman to clause 2(a)(i) which says:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may by order determine in respect of any new valuation roll being made up under this section that only such classes of lands and heritages as may be specified in the order shall be so valued or revalued".</p></blockquote>
As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, there is no statutory definition of these classes. Therefore, under the powers sought by the Government in the clause it would be perfectly possible to discriminate in the way that I suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No. Any such power refers only to the question of the next revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 45, leave out from "between" to "the" in line 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has become quite important in its way and deserves some exploration. Again, I unashamedly say that it is a probing amendment. Its effect is to remove from line 45 the phrase:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as regards Scotland as a whole"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
in clause 2 and the now notorious new subsection (6B).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should make an important distinction at this point. With amendment No. 4 we were trying— and we have had a very generous response from the Minister—to write in a provision that the specification for revaluation purposes should apply throughout Scotland. Now, at a later stage, in very different circumstances, we appear to be doing the exact opposite. Of course, there are very different circumstances, and it would have a very different effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (6B), as was carefully explained by the Minister, seeks to ensure that whatever changes may be made in the rateable value of individual properties—that, of course, would happen only where a category had been specified for revaluation—the relationship between the various classes, either specified or unspecified, that make up the total shall remain the same. But the ratio that has to be preserved is a Scottish ratio and no other. In other words, if, say, 35 per cent, of the total rateable value came from domestic properties and there were a larger figure of 50 per cent for industrial properties—these are not the figures the Minister gave earlier, which I am afraid I have forgotten—and that was the position in Scotland as a whole, clearly that ratio must not change, whatever the effects of revaluation or non-revaluation in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
individual categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-evidently, there would be a totally different result if the ratio were allowed to be preserved not on a total Scottish basis but on a regional basis. In other words, it might be found that it was 35 per cent, domestic and 50 per cent, industrial for Scotland as a whole, but that, for the sake of argument, in Strathclyde it was only 30 per cent, for domestic while industry might be 55 per cent. I take these purely as hypothetical figures. Therefore, there might be a quite different series of dividers and of multipliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable—I put it no higher than that—that if there is a rating and valuation system which depends upon individual assessment areas, with their own assessors and staff, it would be better to preserve the ratio in these individual areas rather than the somewhat artificial concept of Scotland, which obviously takes under its umbrella—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
