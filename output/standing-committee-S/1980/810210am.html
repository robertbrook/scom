REDUCTION OF RATE SUPPORT GRANT WHERE LOCAL AUTHORITY'S ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will have gathered in the course of our recent debate that we regard this clause as one of the most obnoxious clauses, if not the most obnoxious, in the Bill. The Secretary of State said on Second Reading that the powers in clause 13
<br><blockquote><p>"have been repeatedly enacted and re-enacted by successive Labour Administrations so that there is nothing particularly partisan about them."</p></blockquote>
In other words, he was saying that there was absolutely nothing new in the clause. Then in the very next column he contradicted himself, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that not only the old powers but the new powers will be used, if ever, very seldom."</p></blockquote>
Disregarding the appalling grammar of that sentence, I point out that the reference to "new powers" is in conflict with what he had said a few minutes earlier.<br><br>
The situation was more accurately and pungently described by my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), who spoke immediately after the Secretary of State, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 13 gives absolute power to the Secretary of State. He will determine what is excessive and unreasonable. Under the proposed subsection (1A) <i>{b)</i> the Secretary of State may have regard not only to the expenditure of other local authorities, but also 'to general economic conditions.' In case something might slip through the net, another little sub-paragraph has been inserted. It states: 'to such other criteria as he considers appropriate.'"</p></blockquote>
He went on at length to encapsulate our objections to this clause in general.<br><br>
My hon Friend ithe Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), when winding up that debate, referred to the explanatory and financial memorandum, which says simply:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 13 extends the Secretary of State's powers to reduce any element of rate support grant … where he is satisfied that the authority's estimated expenditure is excessive and unreasonable."</p></blockquote>
My hon Friend referred to a minute of a meeting between COSLA's finance committee and the Secretary of State on 17 October, a minute which was not contradicted by the Minister, which referred to other relevant considerations which the Secretary of State would take into account in determining whether he would reduce local authority grants. When he was pressed by COSLA on what precisely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
that meant, no indication was given then or at any subsequent date.<br><br>
When the Minister replied to the Second Reading debate he made no attempt to deal with that particular point of the new powers, nor with .the phrase used in that COSLA minute, and enshrined in the Bill in the memorable phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"such other criteria as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
It is those grave and comprehensive catch-all threats that so anger and worry everybody.<br><br>
On Second Reading even the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) expressed reservations about this clause. He said that it contained:
<br><blockquote><p>"a useful extension of powers".</p></blockquote>
But later he used these words:
<br><blockquote><p>"My second worry is whether the Secretary of State will be able to give sufficient pre-indication to councils of his view of the level at which expenditure becomes excessive and unreasonable, by setting out, at an early stage, the sort of criteria mentioned in the new subsection (1A), inserted by clause 13(6). Paragraph (6) of the new subsection refers to:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'general economic conditions'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>and paragraph (c) refers to</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>such other criteria as he considers appropriate.'"—[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1215–42.]</p></blockquote>
He did not know how wide that was or what those criteria were. He was fairly mild in his expressions of discontent and disquiet about the terminology used in that part of the clause.<br><br>
It is significant that in their representations to us about this clause both COSLA and the EIS, the teachers' union, use almost identical language in their condemnation of these iniquitous provisions. There was obviously no collusion between the EIS and COSLA, but in its representations COSLA said that the new powers in clause 13
<br><blockquote><p>"strike at the very heart of local democracy."</p></blockquote>
The EIS said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There provisions pose a serious threat to local government democracy and autonomy."</p></blockquote>
It continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"This attempt on the part of the Government to impose financial restrictions on local authorities strikes at the very heart of local democracy"</p></blockquote>
—almost identical phraseology.<br><br>
When the Under-Secretary replied in this Committee to the debate on our amendment to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"to such other criteria as he considers appropriate",</p></blockquote>
all that he could say was:
<br><blockquote><p>"This phrase provides the necessary flexibility for circumstances that we cannot envisage."</p></blockquote>
In other words, he does not know under what circumstances or conditions these powers might be used. At no time was the Minister able—and I asked him twice—to cite any other Act in which those objectionable words are used. There could be such an Act but, if there were, I presume that his civil servants would have found it somewhere. That is not so.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said on 5 February that the Secretary of State was given
<br><blockquote><p>"substantial discretion, unqualified discretion … in the exercise of his judgment."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 5 February 1981; c. 358-59.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
We await the Secretary of State's promised reconsideration of these matters with great interest and not a little foreboding.<br><br>
I come to the fairly general point as to why these powers are being taken by the Secretary of State. Few of us would seriously question the right of central Government to determine the overall amount of cash and resources that they make available to the local authorities. Parallel with that principle must be that which asserts that, given that decision by central Government as to how much they will allocate to local authorities, they must also take what steps they can to ensure that that money is not wastefully spent. The two go together.<br><br>
I do not think that I am disclosing any secret when I say that in a few weeks the Public Accounts Committee, which has been going into the overall control of public expenditure, will recommend that the Comptroller and Auditor General's Department take some measure of control over the audits of every body, including local authorities, which is in receipt of public moneys. I am emphasising that to say that I, and most of my hon Friends, accept the principle that central Government must have some control and influence over the way in which local authorities spend taxpayers' money. The great proportion of local authority money is from the generality of taxpayers.<br><br>
We all know that local government is very big business, and in all big businesses there is bound to be a good deal of waste and extravagance. We can all choose our targets at national Government level. The Tory Party looks critically at the nationalised industries; the opposition look with some suspicion at private enterprise. That is the way that party politics goes. At local government level hon Gentlemen on the Government side have had a fair crack continuously at Lothian regional council and at Dundee district council. I do not object to that, but I hope that they will not mind when I retaliate now to show them how there is a good deal of waste going on not exclusively in Labour-controlled authorities.<br><br>
In the Bill the Minister talks about curbing "excessive and unreasonable" expenditure, and I want to put one or two examples to him and ask him how they will be brought within his purview in this Bill or anywhere alse. The hon Member for Edinburgh, South never ceases to mount an attack on the Lothian regional council, and he does it with an appalling choice of intemperate language, to which the Opposition are not accustomed. On Second Reading, for instance, he talked about
<br><blockquote><p>"that flock of cloud-cuckoos who left their own lands"—</p></blockquote>
I do' not know what he meant by that—
<br><blockquote><p>"and became the controlling Labour group in Lothian region."— [<i>Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1239.]</p></blockquote>
He went on subsequently in that speech about small cliques producing "hare-brained" schemes introduced for purely political motives—good stuff.<br><br>
Other supporters of the Government have been equally acrimonious in their condemnation of Labour-controlled local authorities. The hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), normally a reasonable,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
mild guy, poured scorn on Second Reading—as reported at col. 1251—on the Fife and Tayside regional councils. On the testimony of the Under-Secretary, Fife is a reasonable authority, but that does not prevent his hon Friend referring to the councils' joint appointment of a dancer in residence, at a cost of £6,000 a year. No issue is too trifling for Conservative hon Members to get in a crack at Labour-controlled authorities. Others have made critical comments about Dundee district council.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I have no objection. That is what Conservative hon Members are there for. One does not expect anything else, and some of the criticism may well be justified. I have not gone into the matter of the resident dancer, but the hon Member who made the charge ought to have done so first, as my hon Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) suggested he might have done.<br><br>
Some councils are now in the mood for rebellion against the policies of this Government, both at local and national level. We have not yet arrived at a situation in which there is a revolutionary attitude, though it is getting near to that. I have heard many decent men and women on local councils increasingly expressing the feeling that this Government are driving them to the barricades, with the Government's neutron bomb philosophy of destroying people and their jobs and leaving the factories intact. They are leaving the factories like industrial tombstones. Local councillors feel that they have nothing to lose by telling the Government just where to go. I have responsible local authorities in Fife that are at that point because they are so frustrated and angered by what the Government are doing to them, in this Bill and elsewhere.<br><br>
I come to my response to the Tory attack on the extravagance and "excessive and unreasonable" expenditure of Labour-controlled local authorities. On 18 January 1980 a headline in the Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i> caught my eye. It read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Provost's trips: new row".</p></blockquote>
The report underneath referred to the worldwide travels of Edinburgh's first citizen, Lord Provost Kenneth Borthwick, over the last few years. Borthwick was due to retire at the May 1980 elections, and it transpired that that would be a great saving to the ratepayers of Edinburgh, judging by the facts.<br><br>
I contacted the councillor who had raised those matters in the district, Councillor Bert Lonie, and asked him for details, and he was kind enough to send me detailed minutes of the Edinburgh corporation which set out in great detail all the trips that two Lord Provosts, the late John Millar and his successor, Borthwick, who took over from him in 1977. had made. The earlier jaunts that I am about to discuss were—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a limit to how far the hon Member can refer to the individual expenditure of individual authorities. The clause, as I understand it, deals with the overall expenditure of the authorities, and it does not give the Secretary of State the power to go into detailed expenditure,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
except in very special circumstances. Therefore, while I have allowed the hon Member to make certain allusions to the expenditure of local authorities, I do not propose to allow him to discuss them at great length.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not proceeding at great length, Mr. Gourlay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I said "at great length", I implied that any further such references would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we have been incited by Conservative hon Members, not only on Second Reading hut in Committee, I think that we should have the right to reply, Mr. Courlay.<br><br>
Those two Lords Provost in five years had 121 days' holiday at the expense of the .ratepayers—at a cost of many thousands of pounds. It is a great robbery of the ratepayers of Edinburgh. Will such people be caught under the terms of the clause or any other in the Bill?<br><br>
Edinburgh under the Tories is twinned with Dunedin in New Zealand, Munich in West Germany, San Diego in California, Vancouver in Canada, Berlin in West Germany, Nice in the South of France and Florence in Italy. What has Edinburgh in common with San Diego? Just before Borthwick went out he had a trip to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China, and, of course, his camp followers went with him—his wife, the city officer, and a few more. Those will not be caught by the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
My right hon Friend the former Secretary of State tells me that at one time there was power for him to prevent this kind of twinning. I shall seek to put down a new clause to prevent local authorities from abusing ratepayers' money in the way that Edinburgh district council has over the years. Its leaders have jaunted around with their wives and the city officer. By God, those city officers must have been laughing; they were on every trip. The £6,000 for the resident dancer pales into insignificance compared with these Cook's tours, in which the Tory Lords Provost of Edinburgh have engaged over the years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend aware that on one of the trips, which was not involved in any twinning arrangements, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh was sent across to America to deliver to Jack Nieklaus a silver putter on the grounds that it would help attract industry to Edinburgh? From what we can gather about the increase of rates in Edinburgh district, if we are to believe what the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said in the Odeon cinema in Edinburgh on Sunday night, the effect has been that jobs have been lost, and this silver putter trip has been a complete and utter failure. It has resulted in just another burden on those ratepayers who pay their rates to Edinburgh district, which has nothing at all to do with Lothian region.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) will allow what the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has said to be on the record and leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is on the record. We all read about it in the newspapers. It just underlines the point that undoubtedly there is gross waste of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money. But it does not just occur, if it occurs at all, in the Lothian region. Bigger sums are involved elsewhere. I dare say that Conservative hon Members could quote Labour authorities that go on jaunts. I know they can. I can too. But I am dealing with the Tories. If they want to deal with Labour-controlled authorities, they should by all means do so, because there are abuses on both sides. It is a non-party matter.<br><br>
I understand that such abuses will not be caught under the terms of the clause. One of my hon Friends from Edinburgh intervened on Second Reading on concessionary or free travel, and the Secretary of State made a point of saying that he was concerned not with specific expenditure but with the generality of expenditure. These twinning abuses are occurring in Labour-controlled authorities, not less, but more blatantly and more expensively in Edinburgh. There cannot be a local authority in Britain that can compare in expensive abuse with the figures and facts that I have quoted. I would have gone on longer had you not intervened, Mr. Gourlay. I shall get them on record somehow, in some debate, somewhere, at some time in the House or in Committee, even if not in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee has listened with intense interest to the fine detail that the hon Gentleman has gone into in respect of Edinburgh district council. Has he, by any chance, gone to the same trouble to extract the details from the Glasgow district council, which is Labour-controlled, for comparison with the figures that he has put before the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why should I? It is the hon Gentleman's job. He should get one of the Tory councillors—if there is one on that authority—to ask the same kind of question as Bert Lonie asked in Edinburgh. If he gets the figures we can then compare Edinburgh with Glasgow. There may be equal abuse, though I guess that there will not be. The tastes of Labour councillors are not as expensive as those of Tory councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Sandy Mutch?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting comparison— the Grampian region. Let us have those people.<br><br>
There is one more point which I wish to leave with the Committee. Over the five years to which I have referred, there has been an annual average holiday for these two Lords Provost of 24 days. Every year for the last five years they have battened on the ratepayers of Edinburgh and jaunted around
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0726">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
the world from California to Hong Kong. It is time those things were ended, either by this Bill or by some other method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this stand part debate. It is good that we should distance ourselves and look at the actual provisions of the clause. We have been lost in a thicket of amendments for the past three or four sittings and have made little progress in improving the clause. I console myself with the thought, which has been put to us again and again in representations from a large number of bodies and individuals, that amendment is almost impossible. The clause is essentially flawed and should be opposed root and branch. That is the position on the Opposition side of the Committee.<br><br>
This debate allows us to ask the Under-Secretary why he needs clause 13, how he justifies it, and what will be its effect on relations between central and local government. These are fundamental questions, and I believe that some of the answers to them are thoroughly disquietening. There are a number of detailed questions which have not been covered on the amendments but to which we need to know the answers if we are to have a clear picture of how the provision will operate if it reaches the statute book.<br><br>
I should first like the Under-Secretary to give us a model timetable of the year in which the clause is on the statute book and in which he wishes to activate it. I do not ask him to do that in terms of a local authority which is totally failing to co-operate with the Scottish Office. I am not looking for anything of that nature. I am asking him to assume that a local authority is to be the subject of a penal sanction and is therefore in disagreement with the Secretary of State. Otherwise, we are dealing with the unrealistic. I am not, however, suggesting that the disagreement has reached the point at which, for example, the powers under clause 16 will have to be brought into play. I am assuming that the authority obviously disagrees that its estimates are excessive and unreasonable and, therefore, is not striving officiously to comply with the demands of the Scottish Office.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
As I understand it—and I spent some time looking back through the earlier debates—the guideline to be employed by the Secretary of State at the beginning, when he is making his global assessment, will probably, and I put it no higher, be the rate support grant guideline, which is, of course, not mandatory but which is issued for the knowledge and information of local authorities. I am strengthened in that assumption by the Scottish Office Finance Division circular No. 1/1981, dated 15 January 1981. Paragraph 6 shows that the RSG guidelines are indicative and have no mandatory effect:
<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities are however reminded that the Secretary of State considers it essential that aggregate current expenditure by authorities should be contained within the volume assumed for the RSG settlement. As indicated in paragraph
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
28 of the Report on the Rate Support Grant (Scotland) Order 1980, grant to individual local authorities may be affected if the Secretary of State is satisfied that they have incurred excessive and unreasonable expenditure, or"—</p></blockquote>
and then there are some interesting brackets—
<br><blockquote><p>"(subject to the enactment of statutory provisions now before Parliament) that they plan to do so."</p></blockquote>
There is a specific reference to clause 13 and the clause 13 machinery which we are considering. It is clear to me from that, and from what the Under-Secretary has said, that the yardstick to be applied is whether a local authority has kept to the RSG guidelines. It is important to get 'that established, because, as I understand it, the timetable is that somewhere about this time of the year, in February of any given year, the Secretary of State will ask the local authorities to produce their out-turn figures for the previous year and, more important, details of their budgets for the coming year.<br><br>
There was an item on Saturday 7 February in the Glasgow Herald to which my attention was drawn by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). It said that a circular had been issued by the Secretary of State asking for details of local authority spending in the current year, which ends on 31 March. He also wants details of their budgets for the coming year. The report said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the light of these figures, Mr. Younger will decide which authorities he should take action against as a 'punishment' for overspending."</p></blockquote>
I think that the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> rightly catches the public mood and the public impression of what clause 13 is about when it refers to its operation as a "punishment".<br><br>
I have mot actually seen the circular; the Library could not provide it this morning, though it gave me an extremely interesting Press release about the refurbishment of Mons Meg, a fifteenth century cannon, a release which had come in on the same day from the Scottish Office. I can 'think of more useful things to refurbish in the Scottish Office at present but I leave that on one side.<br><br>
In any event, I assume that the Scottish Office will be asking for the figures. Then, on the basis of the guidelines, it will take an overall view of what is "excessive and unreasonable", and once it has come to a preliminary conclusion that a certain local authority's expenditure is excessive or unreasonable it will go through the fairly complicated process which the Under-Secretary described during our last sitting. It will look at individual programmes of that local authority and will, presumably, apply the comparability guidelines, the overall economic assessment guidelines, the "anything else we can think of to get the result we want" guidelines which are in the new subsection (1A). At that point it will then come back to the local authority. There will be correspondence, there will be disagreement, and ultimately the Secretary of State will lay a report and ask Parliament to legislate to allow him to claw back what he sees as "excessive and unreasonable" expenditure.<br><br>
I hope that that fairly short and concise reconstruction is accurate in terms of the process which we shall be going through. What is not clear to me and what I am very anxious to learn from the Under-Secretary is the time scale which he thinks is reasonable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0727">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
to conclude this. Given that the local authority will, by definition, be an unwilling correspondent and an unwilling participant in its own execution, and given that the report has to be laid and parliamentary time has to be found before the Government can act, my impression is that the local authority year in question will be far advanced. On the assumption that the local authority year starts on 1 April, it would be well into the summer before the Secretary of State would have his statutory authority for the clawback which he wants to make.<br><br>
If the Minister does not agree, will he explain what the timetable will be and how he could get this power at a much earlier stage. If it is to be as long as that, the implications are extremely interesting, because it means that the effects of that clawback, that pillaging of the budget for the year which is envisaged in clause 13, will all be squeezed into the second half of the year or perhaps into a shorter period. I assume that there is nothing that allows the Secretary of State to start deducting from the monthly rate support grant payments from the beginning of the financial year in question in anticipation of getting his parliamentary approval. We should make sure that that does not happen, that there is no way in which the normal rate support grant cash flow can be affected under clause 13 before the House has given its approval.<br><br>
If that is a correct statement—and I hope to goodness that it is, because I shall have fundamental objections if it is not—it is clear that the clawback, the recovery of funds from that current year's RSG, will affect expenditure over much less than a year, in a comparatively short number of months. As there are all sorts of statutory duties, it will fall heavily on a comparatively small number of spending programmes. Things like home helps, concessionary bus fares and so on, which are discretionary, not statutory, will be totally devastated by this kind of provision and the way it will be squeezed into the small and comparatively telescoped time scale that I have described.<br><br>
It is important that the Under-Secretary should say a word or two about this and—assuming he is starting to gather information in February, only a month before the financial year in which the penalty is to be exacted— should say at what point in that financial year he will be in a position to move. I certainly hope that we are not, for example, having a provision such as is envisaged for rating and valuation in clause 8, where a payment can be withheld pending a valuation appeal. Surely there can be no action against a local authority until Parliament has approved, and the consequences that I have described must therefore necessarily flow.<br><br>
I ask the hon Gentleman that question particularly in terms of a normal year, but I also asked him to deal with the rather different situation of the coming year. Clause 15 says that the clause 13 penal sanctions can be used in 1791-82. Given that, and given that this legislation will not reach the statute book until at least the summer, and only then could we get the statutory machinery—the resolution of the House and so on—activated, it will clearly be the autumn, perhaps the late autumn or early winter, before in 1981–82 we could get an agreement from the House to a clawback figure against Lothian or any other region which the Secretary of State might think appropriate in using his discretion under clause 13. I would have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
thought that in 1981–82 any cuts made under clause 13 would be literally compressed into the last quarter of 1981–82. That would have ludicrous consequences for any local authority which was to be the victim under this provision.<br><br>
I want a general explanation and a timetable, in effect. Given that the Bill has to complete its passage through Parliament, that it has to go to Report and to the House of Lords, and may well have to come back here as a result of Lords' amendments, I want an explanation of how the Minister will work it this year, if there is any possibility in his mind of so doing. If he says that there is no way in which it will be worked in 1981-82,1 will be happy to leave the matter there. But, as we have been promised vigorous, resolute action by the Secretary of State, and given the kind of build-up we have had and the specific provision of clause 15, I want to know at what point in 1981-82 Parliament is likely to be asked to approve any deduction from an individual authority's rate support grant, and what are the implications and the likely sums involved.<br><br>
I know that the Under-Secretary can say, perfectly plausibly, that he cannot anticipate, that it depends upon the estimates for the coming year that he receives as a result of the circular that went out last week, but he must have a global total in his mind. Given the short period over which the programmes will have to be slashed to accommodate his clawback, he must have some idea of what is a reasonable figure to look for.<br><br>
I have asked those fairly detailed and I think very relevant questions because I have no real idea whether I am on the right track regarding the timetable, which I have tried to put together from my rather limited experience. I now turn briefly to one or two other points about the philosophy of this provision. The Under-Secretary agrees with me, I think, when he says that we have a duty to consider not just local authorities as legal persona but also the people whom they serve and who in part finance them—the ratepayers. I am very anxious that we should look carefully at the effect of clause 13's implementation on the ratepayers of any local authority which is the subject of a resolution and of a cut in rate support grant as envisaged.<br><br>
It is a threat. Often those who make the most naked threats hope that they will not have to act upon them. They hope, as in the case of the nuclear deterrent, that they will never have to be used. I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary genuinely and sincerely hopes that he will not have to use his powers under clause 13. I give him credit for that at least, though I think that some of his Back-Bench troops, and some of his more exotic Tory supporters, would probably see a certain positive benefit in executions "pour encourager les autres". But let us assume that he at least takes the view that it would be better if he did not have to make these cuts. Then we would envisage a situation in which the local authority would not have its revenue cut by the Government under this clause because it would have acquiesced to having it cut under the generally miserable approach to local authority spending under the rate support grant. The result for the ratepayers would be a substantial loss of services and a substantial reduction in employment in the area.<br><br>
We are not too worried about that in terms of this clause, although we are extremely worried about the effect of Government policy. What we have to concern
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
ourselves with here is the situation in which the sanction will be used, and what the effect would then be on the ratepayers of that particular area. The Minister waxed eloquent, and was fairly scathing, about an Opposition amendment which suggested that a similar sanction should be available to deal with authorities that did not reach or maintain a reasonable standard of service. The Minister said at the time that it was illogical to say to an authority "You are spending too little, so we are going to take more away from you."<br><br>
I am not sure about that. I think on reconsideration that it might not be an ineffective sanction. Authorities might well feel that if they would get the money they might as well put up the services, and that if they did not do so they would have further cuts, which would make no sense from the point of view of their housekeeping. However, I took the Under-Secretary's point. But let us consider what he is suggesting in terms of the authority which he says is spending unreasonably and excessively. When that authority, in order to maintain its services, puts a certain amount of money on the rates, that money will raise no additional revenue at all. Immediately, pound for pound under clause 13, there will be a claw back on the rate support grant. So, as a result of the championing of the Under-Secretary, the unfortunate ratepayers will be paying additional rates, and they will get no revenue whatsoever to be spent on services as a result of that rating.<br><br>
The people who will inevitably be victimised, who will really be given an appallingly bad bargain by the implementation of clause 13, are the ratepayers in whose name, and to protect whom, the Under-Secretary claims to be acting. I am sure the Under-Secretary will accept that it is very unlikely that the local authority will do without the grant and do without the rates in that situation, thus having to reduce standards to a level which would be totally unacceptable to everyone on both sides of the Committee. The victims of his policy are the ratepayers that he is trying to protect.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is right to say that the ratepayers will get a bad bargain. But the reason, in the circumstances that he has outlined, will be that a local authority, knowing in advance that excessive and unreasonable expenditure will lead to a loss of an equivalent amount of rate support grant, nevertheless refuses to accept reality—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Blackmail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—and insists on rating its ratepayers to an excessive and unreasonable amount. A local authority that has any sense in the matter and knows perfectly well that its proposed expenditure is grossly in excess of a reasonable level will not seek to impose excessive rates on the ratepayers, knowing that it will simply lead to an equivalent loss of rate support grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Blackmail and threats are not pleasant in any language, but what price all the mealy-mouthed incantations from the Conservative Benches about local authority independence, the right of local government to decide its own priorities, in the light of that kind of naked aggression from central Government?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
What I am discussing with the hon Gentleman is a situation in which this sanction must be implemented. He is trying to get out of the difficulty by saying "I hope that the other side will cave in and that we never have to implement it." But, as he implied to me in an earlier debate—and I agree with him; it is a matter of jurisprudence—a sanction is not a sanction unless those who have it within their power to use it are prepared to use it in necessity. If we use it in necessity here, if it is forced upon the Secretary of State, the result will be as I have described. It will be a total disaster for the ratepayers of the area concerned.<br><br>
That seems to me to be the logic of the madhouse, or it is perhaps the logic of the Conservative Party at present, when economic theory has been confused almost with theology. It will not do, and we are getting ourselves into an intolerable situation, if we erect this monstrous sanction and then agree that the victims when we use it are the people that we are allegedly trying to protect. The Under-Secretary should consider the logic of his own position.<br><br>
Our position has been that the clause is oppressive and unnecessary. The Minister will argue that it is merely a revamp of existing machinery, that section 5 of the 1966 Act is upon the statute book and that all that he is trying to do is to make it effective and usable. For the reasons that I have just outlined, I think that that is a poor argument. But even if one had some sympathy with what the Under-Secretary has been saying on those lines, one has to see this clause in the context of what the Government are doing to local authorities. I cannot argue them all individually and stay within the bounds of the Chair's tolerance, but let me give a brief list.<br><br>
Let us not forget that there has been a root and branch assault upon the independence of local authorities by the Government recently. We have had the attempt to force up local authority rents and to link arbitrary rent levels to the housing capital allowances, a totally new and dangerous innovation which cannot be defended. The most stringent cash limits have been imposed. I accept that my Government, the Labour Government, introduced cash limits, I object not to the principle but to the way in which it has been applied— with a brutality and a devastating effect upon local government services which none of us anticipated would be justified by this or any other Administration. The resources ratio in the rate support grant has been gerrymandered. It has been altered considerably to try to penalise high-spending authorities.<br><br>
Apart from clause 13, we have clause 14, which does a great deal to alter the resources calculation in the rate support grant. Clause 23 allows a totally new innovation, the right to revoke or to vary capital consent after it has been given. So we are faced with a whole battery of fundamental encroachments upon the independence of local authorities. The crowning achievement in this rather Kafkaesque construction of inhibitions upon local authority independence is the penal sanctions in clause 13. We do not think that they are necessary or that they can be made the more palatable by all the sweet talk and smooth slogans to which I referred a moment or two ago about independence and discretion and the right of a local authority to run its own house and look after its own affairs. It does not matter how reasonable they are if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0729">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
at the end of the day they mask the fact that the Secretary of State's actions are unreasonable.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) correctly said—I made a similar point during the housing support grant debate on the Floor of the House—that local authority councillors were near to breaking point on this matter. I am not referring to "Trots", militants or unreasonable people of any sort. The word "unreasonable" as used here depends entirely on the point of view of the Secretary of State for Scotland. All sorts of honourable mainstream councillors are now asking, daily, "What is the point of going on? What is the point of getting ourselves tied in as an executive arm to policies which we abhor, which we say are positively damaging and which we are not allowed to influence in any way?"<br><br>
If that mood of defeatism—I say that, because I argue against it within my own party—became the dominating view, it would be very sad. I can understand the danger, because the mood is based upon the arbitrary and unreasonable actions of this Conservative Administration. The clause is undoubtedly the most dangerous and objectionable example. It is seen as an act of vengence, of prejudice. The fact that it applies only to those that are thought to be excessive and unreasonable in expenditure, and has not been extended to those that do not maintain reasonable standards is a considerable blunder, to put it no higher, by the Under-Secretary. It has reinforced the considerable doubts that have been expressed by councillors right across the political spectrum.<br><br>
I am not here to defend every local authority and every policy of every individual local authority. There are many with which I would disagree. But within certain wide limits we should wherever possible leave local authorities to make their own mistakes and to be answerable to their own electorates. I do not think that it is the job of the Scottish Office to try to restrict and control them in this way.<br><br>
I fear that clause 13 is a method of trying to become involved in a highly publicised fight with one or two local authorities that have been picked out as presentationally vulnerable, as a means of distracting from the general level of financial desolation and devastation which has been inflicted on local authorities throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. I take seriously—I hope that the hon Gentleman himself will—the Under-Secretary's pledge that individual programmes will not be the basis on which a move will be made against a local authority, but that a global, overall view will be taken. I also take seriously what I quoted from the circular earlier—that the guiding criteria for that first global view will be the rate support grant guidelines.<br><br>
My information—I have not checked it out by parliamentary question or through a letter to the Under-Secretary, but I shall do so—is that a number of authorities are further over the guidelines laid down by the Secretary of State than, for example, Lothian or one or two of the others which have been attracting so much publicity recently. If we find, for example, that there are moves against an authority because it has exceeded its guideline but that, strangely, other authorities which have exceeded their guidelines have not been moved against in the same way, our belief that political spleen and prejudice have had a large say in the use of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
these powers will be confirmed. The row will be prolonged, deafening, bitter and bad for the whole Scottish political system.<br><br>
I cannot tell the Under-Secretary his own business, but I hope that he will remember that if there are to be criteria they must be applied objectively. If they are global in terms of excess over the guidelines, we shall be looking anxiously to make sure that they have been applied across the board against all authorities that are over the guidelines to the same or to a greater amount. I hope that he will bear that in mind before he starts looking for convenient sacrificial offerings, or convenient victims who will be seen merely as a way to distract attention from what he is doing across the board.<br><br>
Argue as the hon Gentleman will—and I am sure that he will argue with great persuasiveness here and in many other places—I believe that the new machinery is arbitrary and that it is available at the whim of the Secretary of State. That is not good or safe. There was some evidence, which the Under-Secretary may even have seen, on the rate support grant to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. It was given by Sir William Fraser, the Permanent Under-Secretary. Referring to the needs element in the rate support grant, he came up with what may be in the Civil Service a cliche, but which struck me and some of my colleagues as a splendid phrase. He agreed that the the factors were objective, but said that inevitably they would be subjectively applied. Whatever we may say about the criteria written into clause 13—and we find them far too loose to provide any effective protection—they will inevitably be subjectively applied, and I very much fear—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon Friend's attention to the actual quotation? Sir William Fraser went further than saying that the criteria would be subjectively applied. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"they are subjectively or politically applied".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was about to make. I agree that it will be a political decision, and it is important that the Under-Secretary and his senior colleague should bear that in mind when they come to apply a clause which has no basis in equity and no justification in theory, and for which there is no necessity in practice.<br><br>
There are in the criteria no adequate protections. There are in Parliament no adequate protections. An affirmative resolution of the House with United Kingdom whipping is a poor thing on which to rely. For example, we have seen that even if the Secretary of State faces opposition from Government Back Benchers it has little impact on what this Administration will do. If one takes, for example, the debate on the colleges of education, one sees that there has been no practical result from the virtual explosion into the argument of the hon Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) or the quiet soliloquisings of the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), who we all know feels that his Government are totally wrong on that issue. There have been no results. So even if we manage to mobilise the consciences of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
Conservative Back Benchers, which is sometimes difficult, an affirmative resolution of the House will be little protection for the unfortunate local authority concerned.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has no friends at all on this issue. I quoted earlier in our debate an extract from a speech by the hon Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor), then hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, clause 5 of the 1966 Local Government Act. I should like to quote another passage:
<br><blockquote><p>"If he"—</p></blockquote>
the then Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"asks them"—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"and gets an unsatisfactory answer, what precisely will he do then? … we have the answer: he is going to cut their grants. But that is no answer at all. If expenditure is excessive or unreasonable, it is the ratepayers of that area who will be carrying the can. They are the ones who will suffer, and they deserve the protection which the Government should be giving them.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"We suggest that the only weapon which the Under-Secretary has is to cut their grants and make the situation worse for the local authorities concerned."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the point. That is exactly what the Under-Secretary is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman say what was the Labour Government's response?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly can. I can read the speeches. My view is that they were unsatisfactory at that time. As the Under-Secretary knows, we have never used this machinery.<br><br>
The hon Member for Southend, East went on to ask how, if the Secretary of State were to take such action,
<br><blockquote><p>"does he consider that that will help the position of ratepayers affected by … unreasonable expenditure?"— [<i>Official Report, Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 7 July 1966; c. 175-76.]</p></blockquote>
These are still the relevant questions. They were not answered then. They are not answered now. The powers have been revamped; they have been made more stringent. We are promised that they will be used with energy and resolution in future, yet there is no conceivable answer to these questions, because the points they make are correct and devastating. At the end of the day the ratepayers' position will have been worsened.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has no one running to his support. There is no one in the field to help him. We may get the odd speech this morning, but there has been practically no support across the range of local government opinion. We know that COSLA is opposed to the Bill. I quote a gentleman who will be known for his loyalty to the Conservative Party, the chairman of COSLA, Mr. Fitzgerald, an ex Tory Lord Provost of Dundee, as I remember rightly. I quote him from The Scotsman of Saturday, 17 January:
<br><blockquote><p>"The overriding feeling"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in COSLA—
<br><blockquote><p>"was that we must try to maintain the identity of local government. While there may be divisions of opinion about Government policies in general there is an absolutely unanimous view in the convention that it is essential in the interests of the ratepayers that local government services be administered by the locally elected members."</p></blockquote>
That was said in the context of absolute opposition to clause 13 by Mr. Fitzgerald, speaking on behalf of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
Tory authorities as certainly as he was speaking on behalf of the Labour local authorities. So the Under-Secretary is isolated and alone in the local government world.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman should repent of this clause and retreat before the damage is done. We cannot use this clause. I say "we" because a future Labour Secretary of State, for some reason equally unjustified, might wish to conduct a vendetta against some other local authority. Wherever it is used, it will be seen as a political decision which, by its very existence, is an attack upon the essential principle of local authority democracy. Let me quote the Permanent Under-Secretary again, when he was talking in general terms to the Select Committee, as reported at page 6 of the minutes of evidence taken before the Committee on Wednesday 19 December. Sir William Fraser said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The degree to which central Government can directly control the expenditure of local authorities is clearly a matter, I would have thought, of fundamental constitutional importance in the sense that local authorities are not appointed by Ministers. They are authorities elected in their own right. Therefore, it is very much a political decision, the degree to which central Government controls their expenditure."</p></blockquote>
He went on to argue to what extent that was justified and to what extent the rate support grant, as we have known it, was a means of influence, as distinct from control of local government expenditure. But that nice piece of philosophical argument about influence versus control becomes irrelevant when we are faced with the kind of brutal, direct threat that we have in clause 13. It is clear that this is direct control, backed up by the worst sort of penal sanction. As Sir William Fraser has said, that is clearly a matter of fundamental constitutional importance and of political judgment.<br><br>
We have been promised the kind of robust and vigorous action which we all fear. COSLA has described the clause as striking at the very heart of local democracy. The Opposition agree. It will not do for the Minister to shelter behind a few platitudes and to talk in generalities. He is now being accused by responsible local authorities of actions and attitudes which are fundamentally bad for the relationship between central Government and local government, which will poison that relationship for a long time.<br><br>
The city of Glasgow, for example, considers that the powers proposed in the clause will result in an unnecessary centralising of control in Scotland. I pick that phrase because it is expressed reasonably. It is not shouted from the rooftops; it is not a personal attack upon the Government, or anything of that kind. It is a calm assessment of the implications of this kind of thing—that it is centralising, that it is striking at local authority democracy and that it is, therefore, not just unnecessary but basically mistaken and dangerous.<br><br>
I know that the Under-Secretary cannot today abandon his clause—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon Gentleman would have to talk to the Secretary of State first. I hope that he will go back and discuss this again with his colleagues. Given, on the whole, the good record of local government, it is only possibly this year that we have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
situation where the guidelines globally have been exceeded. The record of local government in terms of controlling its expenditure has been much better than that of central Government. It is rank and arrant hypocrisy for junior Scottish Ministers to complain about inadequate control of spending, given the record of central Government over the last few years. I say that with some conviction, but it should be said with a great deal more conviction by the Government, given their views on public spending and the need to control it.<br><br>
It is an enormous and massive heresy that local government as a whole has been a conspicuous sinner in this respect. If, on the basis of that prejudice, on the basis of that misconceived belief about what is in the national interest, we are to poison the relationship between local and central government, if we are to import useless blunderbuss-type sanctions which will hit and penalise the people they are meant to protect, it is a sad and dangerous day for local government in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon Friend the Under-Secretary to close his mind, if not his ears, to some of the blandishments of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who, in his usual way, has put forward a reasoned and logical argument. Unfortunately, it seems to be based on a false premise, as are so many arguments that we have heard from the Opposition.<br><br>
What has worried me in listening to the debate on this clause, both on the amendments and this stand part debate, is the Opposition's philosophy. They assume that somehow councils can spend what they want when they want and always turn to the Government to ask them to foot the bill. It is the philosophy of the bottomless pit. But hon Gentlemen forget that the money that comes in rate support grant is money which comes from ordinary people everywhere as well as ratepayers. It comes in the form of taxation, and there is no sense in trying to create an image in local government that it is the ratepayers against Government, because what we effectively mean when we talk about controlling expenditure is not only the protection of the ratepayer, but the protection of the taxpayer. Until hon Members and people outside accept that that money will come from ordinary people's pockets, there will never be the incentive in local government or in national Government to try to control expenditure.<br><br>
I believe that the clause sets out in a sincere and objective way to give powers to the Secretary of State to define and set a limit of reasonable expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not entirely hypocritical of the hon Gentleman to say this now, whereas before the general election, when I had the pleasure of being a councillor in the Lothian region, every letter we received from the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) asked us to spend more money in his constituency on education, social work and every other facility? He cannot have it both ways and he should realise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon Gentleman bothered to read my letters, as opposed to waiting to be told by his Director of Education what they were about, he might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
have discovered that what I was asking him to do was to spend the money rather better than he was spending it, to spend it on priorities which were useful rather than priorities which were not. I shall come to that, if I may, in a moment.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the hon Member for Garscadden on the question of the effects of the clause on the ratepayer. As the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) pointed out, this is a question that I asked on Second Reading when I wanted to know how the clause would affect the ratepayer. I have listened to the arguments which have been put forward during the debate. It strikes me that the argument being put forward by the hon Member for Garscadden is a very strange one. He called it a disaster for the ratepayers. It could be. But it could only be a disaster for the ratepayers if, knowing that it would not see any more money, the council involved went ahead and raised the rates anyway. That may be his view of the sort of behaviour to be expected from the Lothian regional council. He seems to be suggesting that councils such as Lothian are so spoilt in their attitudes—and that is the only word for it—that if they were stopped by the Government from spending over a certain limit—despite the fact that they would not be able, even by raising the rates, to spend over that limit—they would nevertheless turn round and bash the ratepayers in a fit of vengeance. That is the only way in which this could be a disaster for the ratepayers.<br><br>
I may have been very outspoken about Lothian region in the past, but I would never accuse it of that sort of irresponsibility or that deliberate vindictiveness, and I am surprised that the hon Member for Garscadden should think that any councils would behave in that way in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon Gentleman not concede that Lothian region, in endeavouring to maintain services, has had to do so over the last four years when the contribution from central Government has fallen by some 26 per cent? It has had to do so and find the money elsewhere through the rates because that was the only way that it would have been able to maintain the services in the face of central Government's withdrawal of funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon Gentleman lives in Edinburgh. I do not know whether he pays rates himself. If he talked to ratepayers in Edinburgh, as I have, he would find that, despite the fact that rates have risen to the Edinburgh ratepayer by some 150 per cent, in the last four years, nobody in my constituency has ever told me that services have been seen to have improved as a result. Despite the fact that last year the regional council justified part of its rate increase by saying that it was going for growth, I have yet to meet anybody who has seen growth in anything other than the number of people who are needed to administer that region.</span></p>

schemes in my own time. Reverting to what I was saying, in a sense what the Government are looking for, and this is why I support them, is good housekeeping. They are asking councils to look at what they are spending and to see whether there are areas where they can make cuts, both to save the taxpayer and the ratepayer.<br><br>
Labour Members mock that. This is the attitude that I find so unacceptable in Lothian region. It is an attitude of an unbelievable unmitigated arrogance that says, "We are so perfect that there is nothing on which we can cut back. We are so efficient that no improvements can be made. Everything we do is so marvellous that there can be no cuts." That is the attitude that I face from Lothian regional council. It is one that I faced in a debate, to which an hon Member referred earlier, on Sunday in Edinburgh. No responsible business would ever say that no improvement can be made and that the only thing to do is to continue spending more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the hon Member plunges into his favourite subject of Lothian regional council itemised spending, would he go back and talk through what he thinks will happen. There is a local authority— it does not matter which—which has expenditure which is excessive and unreasonable in the view of the Secretary of State. Obviously the authority takes the view that it is not excessive and unreasonable and is proceeding to spend on the basis that it will raise the rates and have the grants to carry out that spending. Halfway through the authority's year—and I am sure that the hon Member will agree that physically it will be impossible to obtain Parliamentary approval for a claw-back until the financial year is well advanced—it will be faced with two possibilities: either of finding massive cuts in a very short period in the fag end of the year or of raising its rates higher—and I am sure that that will not commend itself to the hon Member—in order to make up the substantial shortfall which has suddenly been created by the Parliamentary order clawing Back the money under clause 13. In fact, the authority could not raise the rates because it could not do that halfway through a year, so there would have to be massive slashing cuts over a very short timescale. Is that in the interest of the ratepayers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon Gentleman has answered his own question. The rate cannot then be raised again and the council would have to look to make savings. It is perfectly possible to make savings in the Lothian region without disastrously cutting services. If the hon Gentleman looks at the clause, one of the criteria upon which the Secretary of State as I understand it will make his pronouncement as to whether the expenditure is reasonable or unreasonable, excessive or not excessive, is on the basis of comparison.<br><br>
I hear, for instance, the Borders region saying that it is expecting to propose an 18 per cent, rise in rates this year without having to cut services and Grampian region saying that it expects to propose a rate increase of between 15 and 20 per cent, without having to cut back drastically on services. But when I hear the Lothian region saying that it cannot maintain services unless it has a rate increase of 47 per cent, this year, I ask myself whether it is not about time that the Secretary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
of State was able to make comparisons as to whether expenditure was reasonable or unreasonable.<br><br>
Obviously the Secretary of State has to look at this in a global way. He cannot sit down and go through every account to find out whether there are particular items which he would regard as either unreasonable or excessive. But I ask him whether there are certain areas which he would be prepared to consider in coming to a particular decision. For instance, would he consider the provision of a local government newspaper at a cost of £25,000 a year as being reasonable, because the ratepayers of Edinburgh certainly do not find that reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon Member know that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman who lives in Edinburgh had bothered to come to the debate on Sunday, he would have heard some remarks on that.<br><br>
I might say that we in our party tried to help this newspaper, the <i>Lothian Clarion,</i> the other day. We offered it advertising and we had a letter back which said that no advertising of a political nature would be allowed in that newspaper. If you, Mr. Gourlay, or any members of the Committee read the newspaper, they would find that it was nothing but a political advertisement for the Labour group on Lothian regional council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon Friend consulted the Oxford English Dictionary? If he does, he will see "clarion" defined as "a shrill-sounding trumpet".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those in Lothian region who began this newspaper were obviously more perspicacious than I had given them credit for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman not concede that this particular newspaper is edited by a journalist who is certainly Left-wing, who is of Labour persuasions, but whose pieces are taken by most of the leading journals in the country, including <i>The Sunday Times, The Observer,</i> the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> and <i>The Scotsman.</i> Brian Wilson is a journalist who is probably in the forefront amongst his peers in Scotland. He is noted for his independence of mind and is prepared to attack the Labour Party as strongly as he is prepared to attack any other party. Even on questions such as devolution—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Interruptions should be short and relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your stricture on that, Mr. Gourlay. I would merely point out that during the Second Reading debate I mentioned this particular editor. I pointed out at that time that he is the highest paid journalist I have come across at £1,000 an issue. I believe that certain of his colleagues feel that that is a very high rate for this particular job.<br><br>
Quite seriously, looking at areas of expenditure, I again ask the Under-Secretary whether he regards the expenditure of something over £250,000 in primary schools in Edinburgh on free school meals, not for children but for headmasters, deputy headmasters and others as reasonable or unreasonable expenditure. That is ratepayers' and taxpayers' money too. I also ask him,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
although this may be a more difficult question to answer, whether he would be prepared, following upon some of the remarks made by the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) to look at the base budget which is being produced by Lothian at the moment which shows a staggering figure of £52,500 for hire cars to take councillors and council officials around the region, and this at a time when as I understand it the people who use the cars tend to have concessionary passes for the buses anyway, and so should not need to use them in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon Gentleman agree that we were talking earlier about central Government economising as well? While he is asking a question of the Under-Secretary about hire cars will he ask him if he is willing to give up his own hire car?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to answer for the Under-Secretary, but I understand that at least in the Scottish Office the Ministers share cars, something which I understand was not always the case under the previous Labour Government. At least the Government are trying to economise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since he is talking about cars, would the hon Member like to speculate on the cost to the taxpayer of the fleet of official cars which was seen in Old Palace Yard last Friday afternoon, to bring the payroll vote to vote against the Freedom of Information Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we are straying from the debate on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. All I want to say is that this clause finally gives the Government a chance as partial paymasters—and that must be the justification for it—to exercise a degree of control which any paymaster should expect to be able to exercise over the expenditure of local government. I do not believe that it hits at the priorities of local government, because it leaves it within the hands of each local authority to decide how to spend the money that it is allowed within the limits. That is the right of local authorities, which must be preserved. What the Government can do, if this legislation is passed, is, for example, to ask why the per capita expenditure in Edinburgh should be so much higher than in other local authority areas in Scotland. If the reasons that they find for that show that the expenditure is indeed excessive and unreasonable, the Government can protect both the taxpayer, to whom they are accountable, and the ratepayer, who is continually being hit by this sort of irresponsible spending, by at last saying to local authorities "That is your limit and you shall not exceed it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the principles involved in clause 13 and to draw attention to the views of at least one local authority. I fear that we are discussing only the large regions, and it might be helpful to say something about the views of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council, which has written to me because of its real concern at what this means. It makes observations about clause 13. In a letter to me of 30 January it says:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"It should be pointed out that Local Government expenditure has fallen in real terms over the period 1974/75 to 1979/80, whereas Central Government expenditure has increased in the same period."</p></blockquote>
It gives as the source for that information the White Paper on public expenditure. The Council goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"These powers really mean that the Secretary of State, who is not answerable to the local electorate and has no connection with that locality, can consider what is necessary or desirable by way of services and decide what amount should be paid by the ratepayers for these services.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is acknowledged that the Government should have the right to decide what contribution they make towards Local Government and local services, but equally the Local Authority should have the right to determine the financing of their own priority policies with the control being applied in a local, democratic way through the ballot box.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore felt that Clause 13 should be deleted."</p></blockquote>
That is a letter from James Hutton, the Director of Finance of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council. He wrote, of course, on the instructions of the council. I entirely agree with the view of that local authority.<br><br>
It is a fact that local authority expenditure has been falling in real terms over the period to which the council referred, and that during the same period central Government costs have risen. Of course, falling local authority expenditure means more unemployment. On the last occasion when there were questions to the Secretary of State for Scotland, I asked about the rate support grant. I think I am right that the Minister replied that 70 per cent, of all local authority costs were manpower costs. Therefore, if there are cuts in local authority expenditure and reductions in the rate support grant, the only consequence must be unemployment.<br><br>
Equally, manpower means services. Services do not exist without people. In local authority work that is particularly true. It is local authorities who man the personal social services on which the community is so heavily dependent, and reductions in manpower will mean that there will be fewer to care for the sick and the elderly under the agency of the local authorities. I am concerned, as all my hon Friends are, at what clause 13 means in those terms. It is very much a case of the Government legislating to facilitate their political and economic philosophy.<br><br>
Central Government costs have risen and I do not necessarily disapprove of that. If these costs mean more in benefits for those who are deprived, if they mean that those who are unemployed do not suffer the drop in standards of living that otherwise could occur, if they mean that Family Income Supplement sustains a reasonable standard of living for those whose circumstances are unfortunate, I would regard that as useful and proper expenditure. I do not decry that, but it has to be borne in mind. Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council reasonably points out that that may be happening—as I say, it may be proper—at a time when the local authorities in Scotland have been reducing costs in real terms.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
If they have been reducing costs in real terms, it is very difficult to see why the Government have come forward with clause 13. I hope that at some point we will hear some arguments from Conservative Members as to why we should have clause 13 in the Bill at all.<br><br>

So far what we have heard in the very few speeches that have been made has been a defence of the Tory Party in the Edinburgh area which is apparently deprived of what they consider to be their God-given right to govern the Lothian area and then regionalisation came along and they discovered that God and the people had other intentions. They have been extremely angry ever since and have done their level best to whip up all sorts of trouble for a very good and competent regional council. It is a very competent council. I remember back to the last regional elections when once again the Tory Party in Scotland was swept away. It still is to be seen up in Grampian. It still exists in Tayside region and the odd Tory can be seen in Fetteresso, Keriff and sundry places north. They are still to be found there, but not in large numbers. I shall not pursue this because I fear I shall wander out of order.<br><br>
To make a serious point, having regard to all the activity of Scottish local government, there is no justification whatever for bringing in clause 13 at this time and the only local authority which has been cited as being a justification has been Lothian regional council. If the arguments that were offered this morning by the Government support the contention that the clause should be brought in because of Lothian regional council, they have failed dismally to sustain their argument. I hope that my hon Friends and I will be able to defeat the clause when we come to a Division, as we surely shall.<br><br>
I believe that there is also justification for ensuring that local authorities retain the maximum freedom possible over their areas of activity. It is a fact that for central Government the Ministers are responsible, but as far as local government is concerned it is the councillors who should be accountable. It is the local government electors who put the councillors into office in the first place. I am surprised that throughout the debates and the proceedings on the Bill the one argument that the Government have avoided, and have never referred to, is the fact that local councillors have a mandate in their own right. Those councillors who run on a party ticket, whether they be Labour, Conservative or the unmentionables,—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Social Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—all run on a manifesto. They all offer a platform as to why they should be elected in their area. Therefore, they have a strong mandate for what they are doing, and the clause attacks that mandate and assaults the democratic nature of local authorities in Scotland.<br><br>
In my own area of Cumbernauld, the council, like all other councils, has had to make and is making very tough decisions about the future funding of the authority and how it will be carried out. It is for the council to decide the level of services. It is the council's right to assess the level of rates for these services, and it is having difficulties in doing so.<br><br>
In the past this local authority was administered by the Scottish Nationalists. They were a very second-rate affair, something of a one-man band, and they left a legacy of mismanagement, maladministration, financial ineptitude and incompetence with which the new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
administration is having to cope. And the new council's job will be made much more difficult if clause 13 is enacted because it will have to have regard at this time and in the future to the difficulties in which it was left by the previous administration and the difficulties which it is having as a consequence of the Government's cuts and the reduction in the rate support grant. On top of all that it will have to face up to the stringent conditions laid down in the clause.<br><br>
I am encouraged by the fact that the people of Cumbernauld are unlikely to be fooled. They are far too well informed to imagine for a moment that the present financial conditions facing the council are the making of Provost Taylor or Councillor O'Brien or any of the Labour councillors. They know that it is entirely the fault of a hapless, hopeless, useless SNP and its lory allies. Some of us do not forget that it was the SNP that lined up with the then Opposition to bring down the Labour Government. Admittedly, it brought some people into the House that we could have cheerfully done without. Nonetheless, that is a fact. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is shouting, Mr. Gourlay. If he wants to make a point I will give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I hope to catch the eye of the Chairman at the next speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall hurry along because excitement will overwhelm the prospect. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East is about to speak, which is an unprecedented event in the Committee, and we look forward to what he has to say.<br><br>
I return to my point. Local government finance will be made much more difficult for the local authority of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth because of the way in which the previous local administration handled its affairs and the fact that its Tory allies are now bringing in this provision. It was an alliance between the SNP and the Conservatives which brought about the present Government and brought down the last Labour Government. There is no escape from that for the SNP. I do not know why the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East is getting so agitated about it. I suppose he is pleased by the fact that the election which was called brought him into Parliament. The fact remains that it brought about quite the nastiest Government that we have experienced and one for which the Scottish people have no responsibility.<br><br>
I hope that clause 13 will be deleted. The Committee ought to take the advice of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council in that respect. I believe very strongly in democratic local government. The clause is the most offensive in a Bill which is designed to attack democratic local government. The local authorities historically were at their best when they had a wide range of functions and the maximum financial discretion and capability in their own right. I do not think that over the years local government has necessarily benefited from the way in which funding has changed. I appreciate that there are massive difficulties in local government finance and I appreciate that, despite detailed inquiries into the funding of local government, we have not come up with a scheme which has found universal acceptance, otherwise it would be in operation and I do not suppose that we should be discussing the Bill today if that had happened.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
None the less, I believe that we should try as far as is humanly possible to preserve the rights of local government, to preserve the rights of local democracy, and indeed to enhance them. The suggestion that that means that local authorities would be irresponsible with the finance of the councils is a total nonsense. It disregards the views of the people and the electors. It assumes that the electors would vote for those who were irresponsible. That is not the case. They have not done so. They have constantly returned responsible local authorities like the Strathclyde and Lothian regional councils. That is their record and their judgment in that matter has been absolutely right.<br><br>
I believe in trusting the people. I think they make the right decisions. Certainly the Scottish people make the right decisions. They have made the right decision time after time after time and indeed will go on doing so, no matter what the hon Gentleman would like to think is going to happen in the Scottish political scene. I do not doubt for a moment that the Labour Party will continue to be the most powerful political force in Scottish life. That underlines our opposition to the principles contained in clause 13, because there is no mandate for it on the part of the Government. There was no promise to do it at the election. There is no mandate because the people have not voted for the Conservative Party in respect of their local authorities. Therefore, the honourable thing for the Government to do, and the thing which I believe is right and in the interests of local government and the communities which local government serves, is to ensure that this clause is deleted from the Bill. I hope that my Front Bench will advise us to take that action when we finally end the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long because there is ample opportunity for my hon Friend the Under-Secretary of State to reply.—<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am grateful for the consideration which the Opposition have for me in all these matters. However, I am perfectly certain that my hon Friend will be able to answer all the allegations that have been made in respect of this clause, which I fully support. I want to return to the question of Grampian, which was mentioned so eloquently by my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) when he indicated the rates increase which that authority proposed to impose in the coming year. It is yet another indication of the good housekeeping which that authority has carried out ever since the reformation of local government, none more so than by the man mentioned by the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) during the speech of the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton)—Mr. Sandy Mutch—when the junketing was mentioned. I have not as yet had the time to check on Mr. Mutch's expenses or any other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not accuse Councillor Sandy Mutch of anything. I merely asked the hon Member to tell us about Sandy Mutch. That was all.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) would be out of order if he were to follow that red herring.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. The hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said "What about Sandy Mutch?" and the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said, "And what about Sandy Mutch?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is responsible for ordering the Commitee and not the hon Gentlemen who have been referred to. I am quite prepared to permit the hon Gentleman to make some short references to Mr. Mutch but not to speak at length about him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to detain the Committee but I take strong exception to allegations being made that Grampian regional council is one of the councils which are spendthrifts. At this stage I can give two instances to the contrary. Of the last two trips that the Grampian regional convenor made to Houston, one was paid for by the Grampian Houston Association and cost the taxpayers of Grampian nothing. The Grampian-Houston Association is a very good working association between Grampian and Houston which has been very effective from the point of view of employment.<br><br>
The second trip was made by the Grampian regional convenor again to Houston where he obtained the agreement of a firm called Dresser Engineering to come to Aberdeen—it is setting up there in May. It is one of the largest oil engineering companies in the world, That is the kind of activity for which we want to see the ratepayers' money used. Those are the results we want to see. They have been obtained in Grampian and following each visit another firm has set up in Grampian. This is why we have good Tory local authorities operating in that area to the benefit not only of the ratepayers—there are more ratepayers in Grampian region than in many others where social security payments keep the rates going.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman said something that sounded controversial, but it may not be as controversial as it sounded. Will he explain the distinction he is making between those who pay rates directly and those who have them taken into account in benefit payments? Is he suggesting that the second class is in some way less worthy of consideration or less worthy of being given decent services by the local authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, what I am suggesting is that the wealth of that particular area is a direct result of activities of the council, and of oil and gas concerns within the region, and, with the greatest respect to other councils which have not been as fortunate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman trying to suggest that in some ways the fact that there is a higher number of people on direct payment of rates or in receipt of rate rebates is in some way an adverse reflection on the efficiency or probity of the regional council concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is to the credit of the regional council concerned in respect of Grampian regional council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in something of a dilemma here.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
The hon Member suggests this morning that somehow Councillor Sandy Mutch and Grampian regional council are responsible for the oil and the gas in the North Sea.<br><br>
Hon Members: Gas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mostly gas, as my hon Friends point out. I would like this point cleared up because, if this is the case, it has escaped the notice of everybody else in the United Kingdom and throughout the world in the last 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is naive to a degree if he thinks I shall fall for that one. He knows perfectly well that I am not talking about the oil and gas in the North Sea. I am talking about the businesses that have been brought into the Grampian region as a direct result of the oil and gas being within that region. It is to the credit of the region that it has taken advantage of that—indeed, a credit not only to the people of Grampian region but to the nation as a whole. As I said earlier, if other local authorities would act as Councillor Mutch and his Tory council have done there might be fewer problems in Scotland than we have at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that with the best will in the world I can follow the logic of the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) and I certainly do not wish to continue this reference to the convener of Grampian regional council. I should like to take up the more serious point raised by the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). It may be asked why we should rise to his bait, because he was certainly throwing out a lot of bait today. One of my hon Friends has said that he is only a small fish in a small pond, but he is in fact the chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland, so we have to take him seriously.<br><br>
That is why it is a strange thing, and it is confusing and disturbing, to find the chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland involved in so much double-talk and duplicity and hypocrisy, such as we have heard this morning. On the one hand he says that local authorities are to cut the rates. Yet time after time after time I have had pages, and files of correspondence from him—and also from the Under-Secretary and the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) saying that I should do so-and-so in my constituency. Mrs. Herriot had files of correspondence telling her to do something else for the people in my constituency. All the other people in the Lothian regional council have had correspondence telling them to do something else again for the people in my constituency. If the rate support grant is not to be available from the Government, if the hon Member says that rates cannot be put up, how are these services to be provided? The only way is by not providing them in Berwick and East Lothian, or in West Lothian, and that would be entirely intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite right that the hon Gentleman received a large number of letters from me when he was chairman of the local education committee. Will he confirm that all of them without exception were asking him to use his discretion to allow children to attend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
schools their parents wished them to attend, when there were places available at those schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, they were not, and I think we shall be dealing with that clause on Thursday, elsewhere. That is typical of the hypocrisy of hon Members opposite. Again and again, representing their constituency interests—and this is understandable—they ask for more services. They are under pressure for more services by the people in their constituencies. There is an increasing number of elderly people. All the people with service needs press them and they rightly press the local authorities. But there is no way that the local authorities can provide these services if the money is not available, either through rate support grant or through rates increases, and they know that. When they are not on specially arranged, put-up jobs by the Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i>—where they get a lot of the middle-class bourgeoisie from Edinburgh to come along and heckle and jeer—they know, when they are being serious and not on these set-up platforms, that this is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman suggesting that the Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i> rigged the audience on Sunday? That seems to me to be a very outrageous suggestion if he is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I chose my words very carefully. I said that the meeting was a set-up, and I adhere to my views on that matter.<br><br>
I think no one on this side of the Committee would deny that the Secretary of State has a general responsibility for the economic situation as a member of the Cabinet, and that he should take account of that. He does take account of it in allocating his rate support grant, the total amount of rate support grant. But when it comes down to this kind of malicious, malevolent allocation between authorities, we take issue with the Government. In terms of the overall amount of rate support grant, and the distribution of that rate support grant according to accepted, assessed needs, we accept that a reasonable Secretary of State might be able to make that assessment. But, that assessment of rate support grant having been made, surely it is up to each individual local authority to decide whether it is in its rating power to increase the amount of money available and thereby improve its services.<br><br>
If that is not possible for its area, it has to answer to the electorate the next time round. As my hon Friend said, local councillors are elected just as we are elected. They have their mandate. We hear the Prime Minister talking about her supposedly God-given mandate. Local authorities also have their mandates and their responsibilities to the ratepayers.<br><br>
I ask hon Gentlemen to ponder on the logic of what they are suggesting. May I square the circle for them? They suggest that they will pressurise and force local authorities to cut their expenditure. My hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said that most of the services provided involve a large amount of manpower. If the only way that they can cut their expenditure is by cutting services, that inevitably means paying off a lot of their staff. I quoted the case of Tayside the other day which involved a large number of redundancies. Indeed, one sees
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
from every local authority's budget that that means inevitably an increase in unemployment because there are no other jobs for those made redundant to go to—none whatever. That means that the Government have to increase their expenditure to pay these people unemployment benefit. Would it not be much better for local authorities to be given the money to employ them in useful tasks than for the central Government to pay them to do nothing at all but languish on the dole? That is squaring the circle. That is what hon Gentlemen are suggesting.<br><br>
On a previous occasion when I sailed too close to the wind, as you rightly pointed out, Mr. Gourlay, I raised the question of the statutory obligations of local authorities. It was suggested that I had overstated the case. The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), who did not speak on that occasion and does not seem to want to speak in this Committee or to represent the interests of those whom he was elected to represent—along with Luke Skywalker, who is not here today, the Lord Lucan of the Committee—said that my comments were cheap and outrageous. He may have thought that they were cheap and outrageous, but, last Thursday, Councillor Mackie, the leader of Tayside regional council—I quote from <i>The Scotsman</i> of 6 February—
<br><blockquote><p>"agreed yesterday that the region would be unable to fulfil their statutory obligations if they confined themselves to the expenditure guidelines of the Government."</p></blockquote>
That is not cheap and outrageous. That is right. That was said by the man in charge of this local authority. The hon Gentleman is shaking his head. I shall give him the opportunity of denying that this is the case—that the Government are asking these local authorities, by the guidelines, to break the law.<br><br>
It may be said—the Under-Secretary said it at the last sitting—that these are only guidelines and that local authorities may spend more if they wish. But that is the point of the amendment. What happens if they go above the guidelines? I quote from a letter from Mr. J. E. Fraser on behalf of the Secretary of State:
<br><blockquote><p>"The guidelines are indicative and have no mandatory effect."</p></blockquote>
But here is the crunch.
<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities are however reminded that the Secretary of State considers it essential that aggregate current expenditure by authorities should be contained within the volume assumed for the RSG settlement. As indicated in paragraph 28 of the Report on the Rate Support Grant (Scotland) Order 1980, grant to individual local authorities may be affected if the Secretary of State is satisfied that they have incurred excessive or unreasonable expenditure, or"—</p></blockquote>
here is what we are talking about—
<br><blockquote><p>"(subject to the enactment of statutory provisions now before Parliament) that they plan to do so."</p></blockquote>
So they may be only guidelines, but there is this blackmail and threat on local authorities that if they do not adhere to the guidelines they will have their finance reduced. That is what we are talking about. It is quite clear that the Government are asking local authorities to break the law.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I wish to raise one other point before I come to an enigma which I want to bring before the Committee—a paradox, a strange story indeed. First, I want to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
tell the Committee what somebody raised with me recently about one of the main provisions in the allocation of rate support grant, the allowance for inflation. This person said to me, "All you need to do, George, is to go on and on and on pointing out that the Government are cheating on inflation. They know what the level of inflation is likely to be. They have their predictions, but they are not making allowance for this as far as the local authorities are concerned." And that is indicative of the way in which the Government are cheating local authorities, are cheating the ratepayer and are cheating the public as a whole.<br><br>
I turn now to the enigma, the paradox. It was raised by Tayside councillors in the article in <i>The Scotsman</i> that I quoted earlier. In spite of the fact that Tayside has budgeted within the Government guidelines for the last five years, it seems to be being less well-favoured than the bad boys. This is an interesting thing and the hon Member for South Angus might ponder on it. He might even go so far as to speak about it. The Tayside councillors were asking last Thursday why they were getting less, and one of the Labour members pointed out that Mr. Mackie and his colleague had been down here last week. We remember that; we saw them sitting in this Room. And again the Secretary of State, in a rather cryptic, less-than-honest reply—[Hon Members: "Devious"]—"devious" is the word, said that they were not here for that purpose. They were not just jaunting—and my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, Bast might have indicated whether it was unreasonable expenditure—but were here to pressurise the Government into giving them more money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what is implied in this article. The Labour spokesman said, according to the report,
<br><blockquote><p>" 'Is Mr. Mackie saying the Secretary of State has dealt with Tayside in a reasonable and fair way compared with other regions?'"</p></blockquote>
And it went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Councillor Mackie refused to discuss his London visit."</p></blockquote>
A very strange thing! Why is Tayside being discriminated against? This is the enigma, the paradox that is before us, because the main worry we have about the Bill is that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary will use the powers to clobber Lothian region. The understanding outwith the Committee is that the provision is purely for the purpose of dealing with Lothian region. So what is the enigma? What is the factor X? We have been talking about the criteria that are being used for determination of rate support grant. What is criterion X? Why is Tayside being discriminated against? The Lothian region may have overshot its budgeted expenditure, it may have overshot its expenditure last year, it may be planning for more budgeted expenditure. What is there about the Lothian region which no other region has? What is special about it, apart from going above the guidelines?<br><br>
There is something being muttered around which I know is a discreditable thing to suggest, and I ask the Under-Secretary of State to refute it. The interesting thing is that some people are saying that the Under-Secretary and his colleagues are not masochists, that they do represent constituencies within the Lothian region. They point out that two Ministers—the hon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0738">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
Members for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) and Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) and one Whip—the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) represent constituencies in the Lothian region and are not going out of their way to clobber their own constituents, particularly when they have marginal seats, as the hon Member for Pentlands has. That is the factor X. That is the criterion X that is going to make this allocation of rate support grant even more peculiar, because the Ministers have to take account of that factor.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that because of that factor we should accept clause 13. I am not suggesting that, because now we happen to have two Ministers and a whip representing Lothian constituencies, we will always have them and that Lothian will, therefore, always have such a built-in protection and that is one reason why we should vote against clause 13.1 adhere and subscribe to all that my hon Friends have said. Local government is important. Local government autonomy is important. Potential councillors are saying that they do not want to stand for local government because it is not worth it any more. They do not have the power to do what they want, they do not have the authority to carry out the service. The Government have emasculated local authorities. Clause 13 is the worst part of a really bad Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has temporarily departed from the Committee because I want to refer to what he said in his remarks earlier on. As ever when talking about local authority expenditure, and in particular Lothian region expenditure, he was strong on innuendo and not terribly helpful when it came to specifying facts. As a number of hon Members have already stated, the hon Member represents part of the Lothian region and he has a bad habit of suggesting in these debates, and elsewhere, that there is massively-excessive and unreasonable expenditure going on in Lothian region, but he has yet to specify where in his constituency, or anywhere else for that matter, this massive expenditure can be seen.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman says a great deal about peripheral items like the car hire he was talking about earlier and about which I might very well agree with him, but which, I would put it to the Committee, are in fact relatively peripheral. What he needs to tell us—and I am glad to see that he has returned to the Committee—is which services he is prepared to see dismantled within his own constituency. He has not told us very much about that, but, thankfully, his colleagues and friends in the Conservative group on Lothian regional council did us the service of actually tabling amendments to the Lothian region budget for 1980-81. This is relevant to the debate because what we need to try and establish is what the Conservative Party, because it is a Conservative Secretary of State we are dealing with now, sees as excessive or unreasonable expenditure by local authorities.<br><br>
It might be helpful if I were to refer briefly to one or two items which the Conservative group in Lothian region wanted to take out of the budget during the current year. I will start off with transport where they wanted to save £1.3 million by making concessionary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
fares available only during non-peak hours. It is apparently unreasonable and excessive expenditure to make it possible for pensioners to move around the region at any but the least convenient time.<br><br>
They wanted to save £0.22 million on removing additional provisions for pensioners living outwith Edinburgh. That might well suit pensioners in south Edinburgh, but it certainly would not suit pensioners in East Lothian or Midlothian or West Lothian or wherever else. They wanted to reduce the subsidy to the Scottish Bus Group, pending the examination of the quality of service, by <i>£i</i> million following the well-tried principle of cut first and ask questions later. That is a brief reference to the transport expenditure.<br><br>
If I turn over the page of these Tory proposals and move into social work, which I know is close to the heart of the hon Member for Edinburgh, South, I find that the Conservative group wanted to save £3.3 million on the social work budget by increasing the charges for home helps, meals on wheels, and so on, and by reducing investment in play groups. Such areas of expenditure are apparently excessive and unreasonable. On the education account the Tories wanted to save £4 million.<br><br>
There is a long list, and I will not cover all the items. A number of the items are rather niggly and small-minded: restrict the provision of transport to playing-fields, £27,000 to be saved; reduce by 40 per cent, the provision for sick leave, maternity leave, and so on, which would mean a reduction of 42 supply posts in primary and secondary schools, £280,000; adjust the amount for milk in primary schools, £164,000; raise the charges for school lets for community use, £100,000; revise the provision for staff for severely mentally handicapped pupils, £42,000. Nothing is sacred, apparently, in the mentality of the people we are dealing with now. The list goes on and on. They wanted to save £4 million on items in education such as those I have referred to. That was almost before they started on staff cuts, where there were to be 17 fewer nursery teachers, 250 fewer secondary teachers and so on down the list until we come to 34 fewer nursery nurses.<br><br>
It is worth putting these facts on the record because the Opposition group on Lothian regional council has at least given us some indication of what it sees as nonessential, unreasonable expenditure, which is more than the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has done in these debates. Will he tell us whether he would support those cuts? [Hon Members: "Come on, get up."] He is not prepared to admit that he is prepared to see these vicious cuts in services in his own constituency, or indeed anywhere else in Lothian region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon Friend agree that the conspicuous silence of the chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland to this challenge means that he does endorse these specific cuts as being ones that he would like to see introduced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that that must be the case. The hon Member for Edinburgh, South is fondly remembered in my constituency as being the sort of reasonable, nice Tory who is represented there. Now that he finds himself in Morningside, apparently he finds it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
suitable and appropriate to present a less-moderate and acceptable face of Toryism.<br><br>
One might have hoped that the Conservative Party would have learned by its mistakes. The last time a Conservative Government brought forward a local government Bill they gave us the reorganisation of local government. They gave us our well-known, or perhaps rather obscure, hotch-potch of a two-tier system with overlapping powers, which the people and councillors in local government have been doing their best to operate over the years. It has not been made very easy for them because it is such a ludicrous system. First, the Conservative Party made the local government system in Scotland mad; now it is proposing to go one stage further and to destroy local democracy in Scotland altogether. That is what is going on. That is what clause 13 is designed to do.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Up to now local authorities could rely on getting rate support grant which would cover about 70 per cent, of their relevant expenditure. The clause will make it possible for the Secretary of State, even after he has set an absurdly low and unrealistic level of relevant expenditure for rate support grant purposes, to reduce rate support grant still further, regardless of the effect that the cuts will have on services or rates within the area of any given local authority. The clause also gives the widest imaginable discretion to the Secretary of State to fiddle the figures for rate support grant. All of us will have to accept that from now on, if the Bill is enacted, it will no longer be local authorities which will be responsible for the level of rating or the quality of services in any particular local authority area. It will be the Secretary of State for Scotland. He will be responsible henceforth.<br><br>
I was interested to read in the <i>East Lothian Courier</i> last week that the North Berwick community council, which the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) knows well, has already decided that there is no point in continuing to make representations to Lothian regional council or East Lothian district council about the rates. They will have to go to the person whom we all now know is directly responsible for the rate increase which they are facing in that area—the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is no good blaming councils for what happens under this new system. The second half of clause 13 goes to great lengths to ensure that the Secretary of State will have extremely wide discretion. It is perhaps worth putting on the record again that clause 13 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In determining, … whether, in relation to any year, total estimated expenses of a local authority are excessive and unreasonable the Secretary of State may (in addition to the matters to which in terms of that paragraph regard must be had) have regard—
<ol>
<li>to the expenditure or estimated expenses, in that or any preceding year, of other local authorities which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, closely comparable (or as closely comparable as is practicable) with the local authority concerned;</li>
<li>to general economic conditions; and</li>
<li>to such other criteria as he considers appropriate."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
In other words, he can do exactly as he likes.<br><br>
The point about comparability is quite interesting. I do not think that the Under-Secretary explained adequately, when we were dealing with an amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
in an earlier sitting, how this comparability system will work. I have yet to understand how on earth he will be able to compare Fife with the Western Isles. Indeed, I have yet to discover how, within my own constituency, he will compare Berwickshire and East Lothian. For instance, East Lothian operates a proper recreation and tourism department. Berwickshire has neither. According to information I received last week, Berwickshire is spending only £2,000 on tourism and on industrial development. How on earth can one compare an authority which is providing services in terms of its responsibilities with an authority which has no intention of doing any such thing?<br><br>
To revert to an analogy which my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) used earlier, one can get back to the lowest imaginable common denominator, the rat-catchers. Some local authorities provide a rat-catching service and others do not. I do not think that the Minister has explained satisfactorily how these comparisons will be made. Perhaps he will operate an extremely elaborate comparability study mechanism in his Department. It will be interesting to know the cost of carrying out this comparability study, how many extra civil servants will have to be taken on to go round analysing which local authorities catch rats and which do not, and which provide adequate services and which do not.<br><br>
As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar) has already suggested, the clause brings to mind the memorable revelation which was made in the Scottish Select Committee on 19 December 1979, when Sir William Fraser, referring to the rate support grant allocation and mechanism, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"they must be objective factors but they are subjectively or politically applied."</p></blockquote>
The criteria for rate support grant allocation up to now have at least nominally been objective factors.<br><br>
When this clause comes into effect, it will throw objectivity out of the window altogether once and for all. Henceforth, we shall have subjective and political factors applied subjectively and politically with malice aforethought by the Secretary of State for Scotland, whether or not that selfsame Secretary of State for Scotland may himself be unreasonable and excessive—and many of us think that the present Secretary of State for Scotland would fit that description admirably.<br><br>
This clause has been deliberately drafted in order to wreck the autonomy of local authorities in Scotland. It adds insult to injury to describe as unreasonable local authorities which are endeavouring to provide proper services and to fulfil their responsibilities. As I have said, henceforth the Secretary of State for Scotland himself will have to take personal responsibility for anything that happens in local government. Inadequate services or excessive rates will be his fault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the quotation with which the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) concluded his remarks. He referred to the remarks of Sir William Fraser in the Scottish Select Committee on 19 December 1979, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"they must be objective factors but they are subjectively or politically applied."</p></blockquote>
It is interesting that that remark was first made in the Select Committee in a previous column by Mr. Reid on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
behalf of the Scottish Office. He made it in response to a question from the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), the chairman of the Committee, who said to him:
<br><blockquote><p>"These are subjective factors which can be manipulated to get desired results. It is widely said that the last Government decided to help western Scotland by putting in a weighted factor for declining population, it was thought that it would help Strathclyde. Can you say how that was done or whether you would accept it?"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Reid replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would say they are objective factors but their inclusion or not is subjective."</p></blockquote>
In other words, if we are to use this as an example of political bias, we must remember that it arose in the context of a decision by the Labour Government to give preference—perhaps rightly, perhaps wrongly—to the West of Scotland, where the political dominance of the Labour Party is most pronounced. No hon Gentleman should choose that particular quotation from the proceedings of the Select Committee without mentioning the specific example to which the civil servants were responding—which was proposed by the hon Member for Garscadden himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that there is an enormous difference between the necessary task of distributing allocated resources and, once they have been distributed—we hope on the basis of an honest assessment of need—building in with the same subjective judgment factors a penal clause which will take away funds that have been allocated on the basis of need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman can wriggle as much as he likes, but so far as it is quite properly suggested that Ministers of any Government must to some extent apply subjective criteria, that matter was first brought to the attention of the Select Committee because of an example, which the hon Gentleman himself used, of a subjective decision taken by his own Labour Secretary of State. It might have been a justifiable preference but no doubt it was taken partly for subjective reasons. That is something which the Committee cannot ignore.<br><br>
In responding to this worthwhile debate, I say something which should not have to be repeated but is essential in the context of the debate. The clause does not in itself introduce any new principle whatever to the Secretary of State's powers. The hon Member for Garscadden nods in agreement even if his hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) does not. There have been for some 50 years powers available to the Secretary of State to withdraw grant for unreasonable and excessive expenditure. The Committee and the hon Member for Fife, Central are well aware that the difference is this Bill is not a difference in principle but a difference in timing. Instead of waiting until the local authority has spent the money and then withdrawing grant on the basis of excessive and unreasonable expenditure, the Secretary of State can do so on the basis of its proposed spending.<br><br>
That may be very controversial. The Opposition may dislike it intensely. Local authorities may hate it in every respect. But they cannot say with any logical justification that this provision introduces a new principle to the statute book. Nor can they use to their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
advantage the fact that these powers have not been used in the past. We hope that they will not be used in the future either. But that will depend on the circumstances.<br><br>
The fact is that the Labour Government not only lived with these powers but re-enacted them on two specific occasions—under the Attlee Administration and in the 1966 Act. On both occasions a Labour Government, although the powers had not been used since 1929, sought to re-enact them. The right hon Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon), who was the Minister in charge of 1966 measure, defended those provisions as being highly desirable and sensible. They enabled the Secretary of State to withdraw rate support grant from a local authority solely on the grounds that its expenditure was excessive and unreasonable. That is the principle involved and there is not a new principle in any of these provisions which contradicts it.<br><br>
All that we are concerned with in clause 13 is the timing of that power if it is to be used by the Secretary of State. The hon Gentleman referred to the factors the Secretary of State may take into account. A perfectly legitimate area of debate is whether the factors that the Secretary of State should take into account should be defined in the way provided in clause 13. What I am not prepared to accept, nor do hon Gentlemen within themselves really believe, is that the clause itself, so far as it is enabling the Secretary of State to withdraw RSG on the basis of excessive and unreasonable expenditure, introduces any new principle at all. It is a principle which has been on the statute book since 1929, and no one will suggest with any degree of conviction that to allow that power to be applied on the basis of proposed spending is a fundamental breach of the whole principle of local authority democracy and an attack on the very concept of local government.<br><br>
But it may be that what is really objected to is not the powers themselves but the fact that my right hon Friend might actually use them. That perhaps is a new principle. The powers are on the statute book; they have been available to the Secretary of State for 50 years, and circumstances might require my right hon Friend to use them. That might be a matter of some controversy but no one will suggest to me that it is a question of principle, or that there is some new principle involved to which we should take exception.<br><br>
The hon Member for Garscadden asked me what thoughts the Government had as to the effect these provisions would have on the relationship between central and local government. I say to him that one of the fundamental reasons we feel we need a more sophisticated approach to these matters is to avoid penalising the good authorities along with those who are over-spending. Let me develop the argument because it is an important one.<br><br>
The basic position is this. Hon Gentlemen will know that when the Labour Administration cut the support to the local authorities, when they took various actions because of overspending, they received—as have we—continual complaints from authorities which by no stretch of the imagination were guilty of overspending. That included many Labour authorities, such as Fife, which felt that they were losing out as a consequence of the actions of a small number of authorities. We were told that it was unfair that the system should operate in such a way as to lead to that consequence.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
One of the main objectives of my right hon Friend since he came into office has been to ensure that if unfortunately it is necessary to take action against an individual local authority, it should be taken against the local authority responsible for the problem and not against local authorities which are not.<br><br>
My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, who has far less discretion available to him in terms of selective powers, some months ago introduced a general abatement of the cash limit, affecting all the local authorities in England and Wales. All were affected by a sweeping reduction in the cash limit provision. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland was able to avoid taking such sweeping powers, and was warmly thanked for it by the local authorities, because he indicated that even with the inadequate powers available to him at the moment, which can only be applied on the basis of actual expenditure, he preferred to take action under those powers rather than penalise authorities which clearly would have suffered if a general abatement had been applied.<br><br>
There is no doubt that it was not just Conservative authorities that were concerned. There are many authorities in Scotland at the present time, including some of the major regional councils, whose budgets are very close indeed to the view of the Secretary of State as to what the appropriate expenditure ought to be as shown by the guidelines. They would have been penalised by a general sweeping power. Therefore we are faced with the situation that Secretaries of State, of either political persuasion, apply their powers across the board, affecting every local authority, irrespective of whether only a minority of them are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
responsible for the problem, or they seek to use powers selectively. I have not the slightest doubt that a selective approach is a far more sensible one to this overall problem.<br><br>
The hon Member for Garscadden asked me what sort of timetable would be likely to be applied so far as the application of any such powers was concerned. He correctly referred to the circular which was sent to local authorities under section 199 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966, which required them to submit information over the next few weeks as regards their budget proposals and actual expenditure. We hope that in the normal year the question of whether an order has to be presented to Parliament for the approval of Parliament can be put forward in about June or July of the year in question. A local authority will know some time before that that the Secretary of State is seriously considering action against it, because by June or July there will already have been the opportunity as statute permits for representations to be made by the local authorities and for the local authority to be aware of the grounds on which the Secretary of State is contemplating action. Therefore any authority, even one that never for a moment expected that it might be acted against—and there will be very few of these—will know at a very early date—</span></p>
