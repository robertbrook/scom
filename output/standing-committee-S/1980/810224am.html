CONSENT TO LOCAL AUTHORITY INCURRING LIABILITY TO MEET CAPITAL EXPENSES ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [19 February],</i> No. 119, in page 10, line 29, leave out paragraph (a).—[<i>Mr. Dewar.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph (a) is the provision of the clause which deals with the .power of the Secretary of State, by order, to amend the definition of "capital expenses" in subsection (2). I (hope .that I can briefly assure the hon Gentleman of the reason why such an amendment makes considerable sense.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman said that the present definition of "capital expenses" in the 1973 Act seemed to be extremely broad. There are two areas, however, where it may be appropriate, after consultation with COSLA, to consider amendment to the definition of "capital expenses". The definition in the 1973 Act describes capital expenditure as being
<br><blockquote><p>"to be met otherwise than out of current revenue."</p></blockquote>
It is, however, the fact that in a number of authorities it has become the .practice in parts of the United Kingdom, including Scotland, to finance capital expenditure out of current revenue. That is, therefore, a factor which has to be .taken into account when considering the total of capital expenditure of the authority in question, as there is this facility at the present time, and that clearly is not covered by the existing definition of capital expenditure.<br><br>
There is also a disputed area concerning the construction of the term "current revenue" used in the existing definition. The Secretary of State's view is that if one is financing capital expenditure out of public revenue at the present time, that means that the total financing has to be met within the year in question—within the financial year in which the capital expenditure has been incurred. It has to be financed out of current revenue for that year. Certain individual local authorities, however, have interpreted it in an alternative way, and have suggested that if the annual payments due under an arrangement are each met out of the current revenue of the year in which they fall due, consent under section 94 is not required. It is a point of dispute at the moment. Clearly, it indicates that the present definition is to some extent ambiguous and uncertain.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 574</span>
Clause 23 does not itself propose an alternative definition, but it enables the Secretary of State to produce such a revised definition. Before he did so he would wish to consult the convention, both on the need to amend and on the nature of any amendment that might be appropriate. Without a facility of this kind it would need new primary legislation once that consultation had taken place. So if it were appropriate to make a change, I have indicated two areas where some change is considered appropriate, but I can assure the hon Gentleman that there is no question of any change being made until there has been the fullest discussion with the convention on the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pre-empt what I hope will be a brief and general discussion under clause stand part, but, in the light of what the Minister has just said, can he give any evidence for requiring this redefining of "capital expenses"? He has more or less indicated that there has not been consultation with COSLA on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is incorrect. What I said was that there were two areas of uncertainty which were not met by the existing definition. One relates to the fact that capital expenditure which at present is met out of revenue does not fall within the section 94 consent procedure. As the purpose of that procedure, which was introduced by the last Government, was to enable the overall control of capital allocations, this is clearly a potential gap in the provision which we are considering whether it would be appropriate to fill.<br><br>
The other area is the actual interpretation. One or two local authorities have provided an alternative interpretation which has led to some doubt and confusion. Therefore, it seems sensible to have consultation with the convention to see whether this can be clarified. If there is need for an order amending the definition, it will now be appropriate for that to be done in terms of clause 23.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the power that the Secretary of State is seeking is subject to an order, assuming that the definition needs to be clarified. It is not a case of applying to an individual authority or project—it is an order. That is a peculiar way to legislate. We are giving powers to produce an order to effect a change which the Minister does not even know is necessary, and on which there have been no consultations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is not following what I said. Perhaps it is my fault because of the way in which I expressed it. The provision does not in iVself change the definition of capital expenses, nor is there any question of changing it simply so that it affects an individual authority. IF there is a change, it will be a change in the definition that appears in the 1973 Act, and that clearly applies to all capital expenditure of all local authorities.<br><br>
This is not a means of bringing specific action against an individual authority which is to be treated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0838">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
differently from other authorities. It is simply a question of whether the definition of capital expenses as it appears in the 1973 Act may, as in the Government's view is quite likely, need revision in the two areas that I have mentioned. All that I have said is that, rather than our come to a conclusion and incorproate a change in the Bill, it would be more sensible to have an enabling provision and, before coming to a final decision, to have the appropriate dscussions with the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Under-Secretary wih care. As I understand it—and I have a great deal of sympathy with my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown)—the Government are promising that there will be no attempt to alter basically the definition in section 94. What is being taken here is a much more modest power—if necessary, after consultation, to bring in amendments which will change the margins of the section 94 definition without completely rewriting it.<br><br>
It is also unsatisfactory that we so often find ourselves invited to give the Secretary of State secondary powers, the power to move by order. I appreciate that all Governments dislike primary legislation, because it requires a fight with Cabinet colleagues for time in the legislative programme. But there is cause for alarm if we go through a measure as consistently as we are, sprinkling every page liberally with the power to make orders.<br><br>
Presumably the Secretary of State intends some of these orders to be laid, and it is worrying that we are doing it in this way. Primary legislation may be a nuisance, but it involves a number of significant safeguards, such as a Committee stage. Hon Members may not see a Committee stage as a great advantage, as we plough into our sixteenth sitting on the Bill. But it is an important opportunity to ventilate points and to find out what lies behind the Bill. I make this claim with due modesty, because it is seldom that we get results, but primary legislation at least leaves open the possibility of influencing the Government during the course of the legislative programme, whereas the short, sharp debate on an order, which we cannot amend but merely have to accept or reject, leaves the Opposition at a hopeless disadvantage.<br><br>
So I enter a caveat about this whole procedure. I hope that it will not be thought to be niggling if I say that the hon Member may find himself on the Opposition Benches at some time. I think that he will find the order procedure frustrating, when one knows that one cannot defeat the massed ranks mobilised by the Patronage Secretary, though there are possibly points of genuine debate and argument, on which a reasonable Minister might be prepared to give way during the course of a debate.<br><br>
On balance, it is probably better to leave section 94, for all its imperfections—which are manifest, because it is hardly a definition—in its loosely defined state than to attempt to define carefully and by rote a comprehensive list of what amounts to capital expenses. Therefore, I am not entirely unhappy with the guarantees that we have had from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 576</span>
the Under-Secretary that that exercise is not in the Government's mind.<br><br>
However, the hon Gentleman indicated that there were two possibilities which I understand from what he said are very specific. In other words, there will be consultation on these two areas. That does not preclude other areas being discussed, presumably, but those two areas will be under the microscope, and, if consultation reveals a general agreement, or perhaps even if after consultation the Secretary of State remains convinced that change is necessary, we can expect orders to appear under the clause.<br><br>
Will the hon Gentleman say a little more about the matters which had been dealt with under revenue but which might be thought to fall under capital? Perhaps he would explain what is involved there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no dispute that they are items of capital expenditure. The point is that, because they have been financed out of revenue rather than out of the capital allocation, they do not come within the section 94 procedure at present. The question really is whether, as they are in fact capital expenditure, they should be taken into account under the section 94 consent procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very technical field, I imagine, and one that perhaps I am not even qualified to become involved in. But what is at the back of my mind are certain procedures adopted by Glasgow district council recently, its housing capital allocation was reduced from <i>£66</i> million to £55 million because of a disagreement about rent levels and various other matters. The council proceeded—I think wisely, though I realise that there are financial disadvantages for the future—to transfer from revenue to capital about £5 million-worth of works which had previously been treated as revenue. Will that be struck at in any way by this redefinition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman is referring to the incident that I think he is referring to, he is slightly incorrect in his description of what happened. This was nothing to do with disagreement over rent levels. If we are talking about the same example, Glasgow district council had used up its full non-HRA allocation on rehabilitation and on loans to potential homebuyers in Glasgow. The Government were unable to give an extra allocation to Glasgow, not because of any rent matters but simply because the total non-HRA allocation for Scotland had been used up.<br><br>
Glasgow then considered whether common good fund resources might be used for this purpose. The Government were happy to agree to that proposal, and this enabled Glasgow to respond better to the demands that would otherwise have fallen on its non-HRA account. But it is not quite how the hon Gentleman described it, assuming that we are talking about the same incident.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary and I are probably talking about different matters. That is not uncommon; we quite often pass on parallel lines. I was referring to what I understand was a situation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0839">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 577</span>
that arose in connection with the housing capital allocation in the coming year. The Minister will remember that Glasgow asked for £79 million and was allocated £66 million, as I understand it, and then subsequently that was reduced to £55 million because of its failure to put up its council house rents in sufficiently draconian a fashion, as requested by the Secretary of State. In order to try to fill the gap there was a transfer of about £5 million-worth of modernisation and rehabilitation work from revenue to the capital section. I am anxious to know whether there would be anything in the redefinition of section 94, which we are apparently to contemplate and effect by order, which would strike at the kind of flexibility which would be an important right for local authorities and which we all should try to preserve.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Minister was looking very magisterial last night on the independent television channel when talking about the Lothian region. He assured us in his best antiseptic style that he believed that how local authorities spent their money was their own business, and he was interested only in the total. If there is an advantage to a local authority in transferring between capital and revenue accounts, to try to make up the shortfall created by the Government's meanness with regard to the overall total, that transfer should be made possible. I am anxious to have assurances that the order will ease the definition and will not rule out that kind of manoeuvre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is simply an enabling power. I honestly cannot say what the results of discussions will be. One or two other local authorities besides Glasgow might normally finance a proportion of their capital expenditure out of revenue. That is often taken into account in determining what the appropriate capital allocation should be. If that is to be part of their capital expenditure, the Secretary of State's interest, which is in the aggregate of capital expenditure rather than the way in which it is financed, can be safeguarded in that manner. I cannot anticipate the results of the consultations with the convention, but I assure the hon Gentleman that we are primarily concerned with the aggregate of capital expenditure rather than the particular means by which it is financed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may not be a total answer, because the aggregate of capital expenditure could be affected by a transfer from revenue, though the totality of Government expenditure might not be affected. If capital and revenue are subdivided and seen as self-contained boxes, as the Minister may be suggesting, there may be difficulties in terms of what Glasgow and possibly other local authorities have been doing.<br><br>
We shall watch with interest what comes out of this consultation. I shall take an opportunity of talking to my own local authorities about what is involved. I may write to the Under-Secretary to follow up this point, because we could continue to involve each other in the process of consultation. It is not a bad thing to talk across this House as well as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
between Government and local authorities.<br><br>
I leave the caveat on the table, and, as we have had an undertaking that there is to be no attempt to make a comprehensive and new definition, but that there will be changes on the margin instead, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 10, line 39, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"but this paragraph shall not apply to any lease (or other contract or arrangement of a like nature) where the capital value calculated according to the prescribed method is below £25,000 or whose term is less than three years".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is also important in terms of discovering exactly how the new system is to work. As I understand the new paragraph <i>(b),</i> the intention is to ensure that certain leasing contracts or other contracts or arrangements of a like nature shall be included in section 94 capital consent procedures. The Government have been worried for some time that there has been a tendency for local authorities to say "We cannot have consent under section 94, but in order to defeat the restrictions we shall not have capital expenditure on a new building, but shall lease a building which has been put up by private developers. That is revenue expenditure, and we therefore do not need consent for it." It may be exaggerated, but the charge is that on occasions some very bad deals in financial terms have been done, purely and simply to avoid the restrictions implicit in section 94.<br><br>
I should be interested to hear the exact scale of this problem from the Under-Secretary, and perhaps a few hard examples of the kind of abuse which this new power is meant to strike at. That is important if we are to judge the value of this paragraph and to know exactly what abuse is feared and to what extent it is presently rife.<br><br>
Of course, the Under-Secretary may say—and I would have some sympathy with his argument—that there is not much abuse at the moment but that, given the unfair, unjust and unfortunate consequences that flow from the way in which local government expenditure is being abused by the present Administration, the use of leasing arrangements may become more common in the future, and that it is to obviate that possibility that this paragraph has been introduced into the legislation. In any event, we are due an explanation and description of the nature of the problem.<br><br>
The amendment is an attempt to put in a cut-off provision. I do not know whether this is drafted in a way which would be acceptable to the Under-Secretary. I suspect that it is not as it stands. It is the principle that is important. I hope that he will address himself to that rather than to any minor argument about the drafting.<br><br>
We are suggesting that the paragraph should not apply in cases where the capital value of the lease, calculated according to the prescribed method referred to in paragraph <i>(b),</i> is below £25,000 or where the term is less than three years. I do not know whether there is any sympathy for this on the Government Benches, but what worries some of us is that the leasing arrangements and the consent for leasing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 579</span>
arrangements may not be subject to any kind of de minimis rule. The result is that all sorts of minor office administration leases might be solemnly processed by the Secretary of State's mandarins. That would be counter-productive.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that anyone in St. Andrew's House or in the Scottish Development Department wants solemnly to consider whether he should give section 94 consent for a leasing arrangement with a typewriter firm, for example. As the paragraph is drawn, it looks as if that could come within the competence of this paragraph. Maybe the Secretary of State will hasten to say that there is no such intention and that that is not necessarily so. It seems to me that it would be better to have a cut-off provision ensuring that the only leases or like arrangements which are caught are those of substantial capital value, as calculated under the Act, or lasting for such a length of time as to be a potential distortion of the capital spending programme of the local authority concerned.<br><br>
I confess 'immediately that the £25,000 was arbitrarily picked from the air by me, but it seems to me that anybody considering a capital works programme would see something under £25,000 as minor capital works, the kind of thing that may not have to go to committee, but can be authorised by a top official. Therefore, something below that could be spared the detailed scrutiny of the Scottish Office—or, to put it more sympathetically, civil servants could be spared the trouble of having to look at it.<br><br>
Similarly, if the lease entered into is for less than three years, there is some merit, prima facie, in excluding it from the possibility of having to go through the consideration, which will no doubt be more than cursory, since no doubt it is important that any section 94 consent should be given thorough consideration. It is better to take this dross out of the system and leave the section 94 consideration, if we are to have this new initiative at all, to concentrate upon leases and like arrangements that are really substantial and might be seen as a significant escape clause from the block capital consent which is normally given under section 94.<br><br>
It is a simple point. The Minister may assure us that there will be, as practised, a cut-off, and that his people will not be anxiously looking at minor hire purchase arrangements entered into by local authorities. But it would be better to clarify the matter. Some concern has been expressed to me, and I think to some of my hon Friends, about this. We can discuss whether we need the provision at all, but, assuming that we are to have it, we genuinely put this forward in a helpful spirit, in the hope that it may simplify and clarify the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall be told that the provision is to bring the Bill into line with legislation which perhaps the Secretary of State for the Environment has already got through for England and Wales, and that the Secretary of State for Scotland requires, broadly speaking, similar powers. What is the evidence in Scotland that there has been any attempt to get round this by contractors, or doing a deal where some building is constructed and then leased to the authority? As I understand it, that is really the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
crux of the problem as seen by the Secretary of State. What evidence is there in Scotland that that is likely to happen? If it did it would be out of sheer desperation on the part of the construction industry, which is in a mess just now. Nevertheless, if it does happen, has the Under-Secretary any evidence of how wide a scale it would be on? Has there been consultation on this with COSLA? Why is he seeking always to take these powers without producing substantial evidence of their need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to deal with the general principle and then turn to the amendment. There is no doubt that there is substantial use of leasing as a means of amplifying the capital expenditure of a local authority. It has been calculated that, for example, in 1977 £25 million-worth of capital expenditure was being financed through leasing. We are now conducting a survey to find out the present figure, but if it was £25 million four years ago hon Gentlemen can rest assured that the present sum is almost certain to be substantially greater. Therefore, we are not dealing with a minor aspect of capital expenditure; we were dealing with substantial sums even some years ago, and all the evidence is that there has been increasing use of the leasing approach for purposes of capital expenditure.<br><br>
The tenor of the amendment represents a point of view which nobody disagrees with. It is extremely sensible, if leasing is to be brought within the capital expenditure framework, that we should not spend an enormous amount of time of either local authorities or the Scottish Office in dealing with relatively minor aspects of expenditure. The hon Gentleman is certainly correct that there is a powerful case for the de minimis approach to individual items of leasing which are in the category to which he referred.<br><br>
We have already had some preliminary discussions with the convention on the administrative side of leasing arrangements, and we intend to have full discussions on the questions of leasing, and in particular on where and in what way a de minimis provision should apply in the way that the hon Gentleman indicated. He himself said that the figures in the amendment were plucked out of the air, they are not based on any one specific assessment.<br><br>
Likewise, the Government do not start off with a firm belief as to what the appropriate cut-off figure would be. We want to hear the convention's argument on what would be an appropriate de minimis approach that would exclude relatively minor items of leasing from the general provisions. We intend to have the fullest consultations with COSLA. There will be no early order on this point. I can give the hon Gentleman an absolute assurance that the concept of a de minimis provision is one which we accept at this stage, and at will be part of our discussion with the convention.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I should like to make a point about some of the items which are being leased now. For example,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0841">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
word processors, which are quite expansive, are clearly helpful to local authorities which wish to contain .their administrative costs. The figure of £25,000 could he reached very quickly if an authority had to employ such equipment. The welter of correspondence which this legislation will necessitate will be something for which word processors are (ideally suited, so far as a programmed response from local authorities is what the Minister wants to most of the diktats in the Bill. But that would require considerable investment in this equipment, which, he will agree, is useful and effective.<br><br>
It is wrong, therefore, to dismiss clerical and administrative equipment as a minor item. Certainly in a few years the microchip will result in a great deal of office equipment becoming much cheaper. The pocket calculator is a good example of something the price of which has dropped dramatically.<br><br>
But if local authorities are genuinely trying to lease equipment, sometimes because of the rapidly changing nature of the technology involved, they should not be penalised. It might well be foolish for them to undertake capital expenditure in 1980 when by 1985 the equipment would be much cheaper to buy, or even to lease. Some of my hon Friends—and no doubt some hon Gentlemen—have leased Ansafone equipment, and we now find that it costs more to lease than to buy, though under the arrangements made by the Fees Office we are not at liberty to purchase the equipment. But often where administrative costs are incurred it is more sensible to lease equipment which seems fairly expensive. Large authorities such as Strathclyde, Lothian and Fife would clearly have to consider such matters in a different light from that of a small authority which wished simply to buy or lease one or two items.<br><br>
I say this not to filibuster and take up undue time. But it is a matter of concern, which is perhaps glossed over, that the Minister is taking powers which he admits are as yet unspecified in terms of consultations which will have to be entered 'into with COSLA. We are not satisfied with all the Minister's undertakings and we hope 'that they will be flexible and sensitive to the changing needs of local authorities. If he is seeking to force administrative saving on local authorities, he should go out of his way to ensure that such saving can be made with the most flexible use of the means of purchasing equipment. The ever increasing burden of administration can often be lessened by 'the use of equipment which is coming more and more frequently on to the market. As models change and prices fall, there is an outstanding case for leasing. We hope that the problem will diminish but that the Minister will nevertheless be aware of it and will look sympathetically at the endeavours of authorities of all shades of 'political complexion to make their administration more effective.<br><br>
Clearly, we are not talking about major items of public expenditure. I spoke earlier about the dust vans of the old Edinburgh town council. That may well be a matter for consideration by the local authorities, though my impression is that Edinburgh district council has far too few dust vans and that the streets of that city might well be a bit cleaner. I say that as an Edinburgh ratepayer who does not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
object to paying rates—provided that I get a reasonable return—as I do from Lothian region. But I object to paying rates to Edinburgh district where I get an inadequate service. It may well be that changes of political fortunes 'in the city will present the Minister with the challenge of the £25,000 limit. But I should like to think that, if such items have to be used regularly and replaced frequently, they would be suitable for consideration for leasing permissions as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an absolute assurance. I love absolute assurances. I am always touched by such absolute language. I think that the fact that the Government have accepted that a de minimis rule will have to be incorporated and discussed before an order is laid removes the necessity for the Committee to divide on this matter. I am grateful for the sympathetic noises that came from the Government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 11, line 2, leave out from "shall" to end and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"have no effect until approved by resolution of each House of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
I am anxious to make progress and I do not think that we need to detain the Committee long. This amendment was put down because it was felt that these were matters of importance. While I am sure that the Opposition's vigilance—whichever Opposition it might be when these orders come up—would ensure that they were challenged and that there was some sort of debate, prima facie I think there is a case for something of this importance being brought automatically to the attention of the House rather than the other way round. I leave the point with the Minister and hope that he will reconsider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considered it and am happy to recommend to the Committee that we should accept the amendment. It is a very sensible amendment and one which I hope that my hon Friends will also agree is acceptable to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a significant clause which is worthy of a few minutes' discussion. It is the one clause, other than clauses 13 and 14, on which we have had representations from almost everybody involved in local government, and that alone entitles it to have some time spent on it.<br><br>
Paragraph 1 of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It provides for improvements in the valuation and rating system; provides for changes in the Secretary of State's powers to reduce rate support grants and in the method of calculating and distributing housing support grants; empowers the Secretary of State to extend the existing controls over the incurring of liability to meet capital expenses".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
But there is no mention of this in the paragraph headed the <i>Financial effects of the Bill.</i> So presumably that is consistent to some extent with what the Minister said last Thursday:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals in clause 23 are not as dramatic as the hon Gentleman suggested."—</p></blockquote>
that is, my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—
<br><blockquote><p>"They are … a response by the Government to tidy up the control over capital consent."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19 February 1981; c. 554.]</p></blockquote>
"Tidy up" to me means a wee quick run round, not shifting furniture or laying a new carpet. As it suggests, it is just a tidy up and no fundamental change. I am not sure that it is as minimal as that. Therefore, I think we are entitled to vote on the clause because I am not convinced that the case has been made.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say—and this is a point I made earlier about bringing us into line with England and Wales—
<br><blockquote><p>"In Scotland the capital consent system was introduced slightly earlier, but without that provision."—</p></blockquote>
that is, the right to withdraw or vary a consent—
<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore perfectly fair to suggest that, if we are to have a block consent system instead of the specific consents which were the norm until recently in all parts of the country, there should be, consistent with that general consent system, a right to vary or withdraw in particular circumstances."— <i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19 February 1981; c. 554.]</p></blockquote>
I might be totally ignorant of how the system works, but I thought we had parted from specific consent some time ago. This is not a party point, but the present Government have applied it in a discriminatory sense against Lothian region. In other words, they have used powers to require the individual consents, powers which, to the best of my knowledge, have not been used for some time. I could be wrong on that. I hope that the Minister will clear any confusion to which I have contributed.<br><br>
Apart from Lothian, I am not aware that this need to tidy up has presented any great problems. It was accepted by all that the block consent system was consistent with the attempt to give local authorities greater freedom. The clause is in two parts: to withdraw or vary the consent, and the changes in the way in which authorities deal with capital expenses.<br><br>
I want to put on the record the representations we have received on this important clause. Strathclyde, for instance, in one of its rare bursts of representation to us, has given us a good submission. The submission was late but this is one of the difficulties with the time scale of discussing and making representations. This says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The interpretation of Section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 has always been controversial but by use and wont a generally acceptable interpretation has been developed."</p></blockquote>
Is that true or untrue? Where is the evidence for the changes and the additional powers that the Secretary of State seeks? If this is the opinion of the largest authority in Scotland, presumably with the biggest capital expenditure programme, where is the evidence that the Minister should be producing to make the case for the additional powers?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
The submission continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The drafting of Clause 23 is anything but clear. It gives the impression as does the original Section 94 that consents are given for individual projects which they are not and never have been in Strathclyde. Consents are given for a specified sum against certain HEADS of expenditure and if the terms of the Section are to be altered some effort should be made to relate them to the system which is operated."</p></blockquote>
That is the point I am making. Over the last few years there has been a tendency to move towards general consent or heads of consent rather than individual consent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman re-reads my remarks earlier in the discussions on this clause, he will see that while acknowledging that in general circumstances, general consents are given under section 94, in the urban review programme, for instance, of which Strathclyde is a beneficiary, the consents were specific to the individual project. Therefore, it is necessary for the clause both to deal with general consent and to deal with those remaining areas, such as the urban review programme, which have a specific consent procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a separate issue. The Minister fairly draws attention to his earlier point, and I was certainly not ignoring it deliberately. I feel it is a red herring, or a side issue. The total expenditure in urban aid is chicken feed in relation to the total capital expenditure of local authorities overall. Though it is important and, we back it and regret that it is the subject of restraints at the moment as well, nevertheless, it is a relatively minor part of the expenditure and if, as the Minister says, it is controlled separately, or there is not the control over it that there should be, then it seems to me that there is a case for looking at that to see how we can improve it. But that does not invalidate my general point that, overall, the general consent procedure has appeared to work.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Let us take one of the other representations from Shelter—naturally, on housing. It expressed the view that under the present arrangements the annual capital allocation given by the Secretary of State to local authorities for housing purposes represents a limit to the total amount that can be borrowed in the year in question. Again, it supports the idea of this general consent, which does not deny the general need for any Government to influence the economic management of the country.<br><br>
We have also had representations from Glasgow along the same lines. It would be repetition were I to read them, but they make quite clear that the system has operated, albeit with a bit of argument, as the Minister knows, between authorities which are not satisfied with permissions for borrowing for capital expenditure. Glasgow rightly makes the point—which has already been covered by my hon Friend—about the level this will get down to to control what might be regarded as brought within the definition of "capital expenses". We have had all of these representations, and some of them are quite important.<br><br>
I want to draw attention in particular to one reason for voting against the clause—this leasing arrangement.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
The Minister said that in 1977 that was reckoned to be of a value of £25 million. I must confess complete ignorance. I never remember a single bit of paper or comment—perhaps it was not in my field; it was not in housing—in the Scottish Office that this was a vexatious problem. Therefore, if somebody has now unearthed a figure, I do not recollect that any member of the then Opposition raised a single question. Therefore, I am still a bit sceptical about the need for the additional powers—this vexed question of capital expenses.<br><br>
To give an example, in Glasgow at the moment—and my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden shares with me in having huge housing schemes that require a lot of money to be spent on them—as I understand it, some of that money being spent is out of revenue. I do not know what the definition is. The Minister has not given us any information. I understand that the definition of "capital" is something which has an expected life of 10 years or more. If a housing authority decides to put a door on a close, or iron railings round the back court, they will be expected, even in places like Easter house, to have a life of more than 10 years. If that is so, the definition of "capital expenses" could further add to the controls exercised over a housing authority by deciding that that is part of its capital allocation.<br><br>
The Minister hinted that that was already done. If it was done, I am not aware that it was done exclusively in terms of the consents that were given. The Minister should clarify this—and no doubt we can come back to it on Report—because it is a very important part of the whole relationship between central Government and local government.<br><br>
If I am not mistaken, does it not have some effect on the attraction of subsidy? A housing authority in this case would get less subsidy the more it spent out of revenue, even though the work could be regarded as being within the definition of "capital expenses". I am not clear about this. Finance officers in local authorities look at Bills. It seems to me that this is what is behind the worries that I have tried to express and the representations we have received.<br><br>
I do not want to think that I have made all the points and mentioned all the details and mechanics of the additional powers that the Secretary of State is seeking. It really worries me that it is all part of a package. Somewhere since 1979 the Scottish Office team of Ministers have said "We need more powers to screw local authorities. There are too many loopholes here. There are some clever people in local authorities, and certainly some able officials who can give the right advice on how to get round any bit of legislation, however tightly the legislation might be drawn." The Ministerial team have probably also said "Aye, and there are a few militants floating about Lothian and Dundee and one or two other places."—the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is nodding his head in agreement—"So we need to make sure that we have all the powers and can control all these authorities."<br><br>
That is what it is about—not minor changes in the control of capital expenditure, but the so-called authority of the Government to make sure that they can put the boot in as and when they feel like doing so. No matter how reasonable the Minister's language might be, that is what is behind clause 23. I submit that it is not merely a tidying-up operation. There is more to it than that. I have already asked the question about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
leasing, and perhaps there is a justification for doing that provided that there is evidence of large-scale attempts to get round existing consent procedures.<br><br>
Nevertheless, clause 23 seems to be part of a package of oppression by the Government against local authorities. The Government will be putting back the clock relating to all the benefits that have accrued from a much better relationship between local government, since its reform in the 1973 Act, and the Scottish Office. It is probably better now that it has ever been. It would be a pity if we allowed this to go unchallenged. For those reasons I shall vote against clause 23.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the clause is at the end of the Bill it has attracted somewhat less attention than the more politically sexy parts related to rating. The capital expenditure of a local authority is ultimately far more important in many respects. It is in the major areas of expenditure that local government can be seen to be effective and local councillors can be seen to govern. Consequently, the representations which we have had from bodies such as COSLA have been far more pointed and serious in their concerns than representations related to clauses 13 and 14.<br><br>
The language used by COSLA is a good deal stronger in this area than it is in others, and it is a measure of COSLA's concern. It made the point that no group of local authorities ever enjoys ideal relations with central Government because the ambitions and priorities of both are different. In the case of the present Government, there is probably a fundamental divide in terms of agreement or otherwise on the objectives of economic policies. From 1975 to 1977 when the new local governments were set-up, there was certainly an uneasy truce in the sense that where capital expenditure arrangements were arrived at, there was a modus operandi which was reasonably satisfactory to both sides. The local authorities feel that the powers in the clause are unnecessary in that they think that existing provisions under section 94 could probably be fashioned to meet any misgivings they had about the system.<br><br>
If a system of this nature is to operate, it must be on the basis of consensus. If not, then there has to be interventionist legislation of this nature. It is evidence of the Government's complete inability or unwillingness to take local authorities along with them that they have to introduce such legislation.<br><br>
As far as the capital expenditure programme is concerned, the anxiety is not simply about the one-year, one-off capital project. Often capital expenditure programmes are sperad over a number of years and permission has to be given at different stages. It makes more financial sense to have rolling programmes of capital expenditure over periods of three years to five years. If the whims and priorities of individual Ministers change during that time, longer-term planning by local authorities will be thrown into jeopardy. Local authorities could incur far more expenditure and thus frustrate the Government's declared policy on curbing public expenditure.<br><br>
We are concerned about the provisions to go carefully through each item of capital expenditure during the course of a year. That point was made by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). We are also worried about the power to operate a moratorium—to say "Enough is enough, and no more"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0844">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
—for as long as the Government see fit. In this area there are even more dangers than in, say, a housing programme which could be interrupted. I refer to housing because, as Shelter pointed out, about 37 per cent, of all local government capital expenditure goes on housing. We tend, because of the size of the authorities, to relegate housing and district authorities to some lower order of priority. With the exception of Glasgow, most other authorities are not sufficiently large. I appreciate that Edinburgh is sufficiently large, but its indifference to housing improvement is such that it does not really count in this debate. Nevertheless, some 37 per cent, of all capital expenditure by local authorities goes on housing. None of us wants to be complacent about the standards of Scottish housing. None of us wants to be complacent about the standards of Scottish housing. We need long and sustained programmes of capital expenditure on housing, and these programmes can be effectively administered only on the basis of three-year to five-year rolling programmes. Once initial agreement has been arrived at, they should be allowed to carry on with the minimum of interruption.<br><br>
The nitpicking approach of the Minister to these problems and the expressed intention of going over each element in a programme could cause unnecessary delay and hiccups. The problems confronting Scottish housing, not least because of the Tenants' Rights, Ect. (Scotland) Act are such that the capital expenditure controls envisaged in clause 23 would make the job of local authorities more difficult.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I have talked almost exclusively about the administration of the programmes but, as has been mentioned earlier and throughout the debate on clause 23, there is involved here an important matter of local democracy. One of the attractions of local government has been the opportunity for local councillors to wield executive power. I think that they have mainly wielded it with restraint and moderation and that they have been able to work in the best interests of the local authorities. In many instances, as I said in an earlier debate, they have seen capital expenditure programmes as monuments to their services in local government.<br><br>
I do not think that that is vanity or a misplaced sense of political pride. In some local authorities there is a variety of buildings, a variety of institutions to which councillors and local political parties can look and say "It was on our responsibility that this was constructed. It was on our initiative that this facility was made available to the public."<br><br>
As far as we on the Opposition Benches can see, although the powers of local authorities to carry on that type of work will not be withdrawn, it will be so difficult for them to do so, so complicated for them to secure permission, that, rather than having powers to take executive initiatives, the local authorities will become simply rubber stamps for what the Scottish Office wants in their areas.<br><br>
The question of the control of capital expenditure should be a major responsibility of those who have the direct responsibility for carrying it through. We feel that the representations made by organisations such as COSLA should be given some credence, and that if there are problems relating to section 94 of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
the 1973 Act, this would have been the time for the introduction of a revision of that section. But, as far as I can see, there has been nothing like the kind of consultation with COSLA which would have enabled the Minister to introduce a compromise.<br><br>
We have here an attempt to drive through legislation—and doubtless a successful attempt, because of the arithmetic of this Committee and of the House in general—which will severely circumscribe the powers of local authorities, which will enable Ministers to interfere in what has always been regarded as the legitimate preserve of local authorities. It will be the end of what has been a responsibly satisfactory working relationship between the Scottish Officer and local authorities. It is significant that none of the local authorities which have made representations to us has envisaged that the next phase in the relationship between central government and local government will be anything like as trouble-free as that of the last four or five years when, admittedly, there was perhaps a more sympathetic administration in the Scottish Office.<br><br>
Nevertheless the fact is that the system worked for the first year of the Conservative Government, and it worked in a way in which there was not profligate spending and in which local authorities were able to get on with the job of governing locally.<br><br>
If this provision is simply to fall in line with the Department of the Enviroment in England, that is a bad reason for changing the system. If anything is evidenced from the workings of the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 of England, it is that the Government have got themselves into a dreadful mess over capital expenditure and rate support grant—to a very large extent because of the size and complexity of the organisations which they have to administer.<br><br>
One of the advantages of the Scottish system has been its well-integrated tightly-knit system, in which people know each other and know what they can get away with, and in which there is an unwritten understanding that local authorities, within reasonable limits, can work together with central Government and that they have to get on with the job of governing the country to an extent that is probably one of the reasons why we have a better and more logical system of local government in Scotland than in England, where there are obvious difficulties. I submit that to a large extent those difficulties are created by the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, they have been able to operate in Scotland in a fairly peaceable manner, whereas down south there have been all kinds of problems and resistances.<br><br>
If this provision is simply to transplant into Scotland the administrative and legal arrangements which are causing such confusion in England, we would not like to see our local authorities submitted to this.<br><br>
We have had some assurances from the Minister about leasing arrangements. Again we return to the point that if the Minister is not to review every individual case, if there are to be financial limitations, if it will not affect that many local authorities, why do we need the legislation? Why do a Government who are committed to having less legislation and interfering less frequently with the rights and freedoms of local authorities and individuals, have to stick their nose in once again?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
Of course, the present Government are committed to interfering in all areas where they do not have total control. This is one area where they do not have total control, where there is a measure of local initiative and democracy, and they are very happy to interfere. The Prime Minister is, to use the Scottish expression, a "nebby woman" who wants to keep sticking her nose in. While she cannot do that herself in every instance, she has many acolytes who are prepared to do it for her. This seems to be the kind of legislation which comes from such a source. I do not want to make a sexist point here when I use the expression "nebby woman". It could just as easily be some interfering old goat in the Scottish Office as anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That describes the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not necessarily describing the Minister.<br><br>
We do not see any case for this clause. We have made clear our opposition to the Bill as a whole, but in this clause we see perhaps the most offensive element of interference with local government, because it subjects departments to a degree of scrutiny far beyond the requirements of public accountability. Secondly, we find it objectionable because it interferes with what has been traditionally regarded as the legitimate rights of councillors. We also find it unnecessary because until fairly recently the modus operandi arrived at between organisations such as COSLA and the Scottish Office has worked reasonably well. It is clearly not based on past experience, but on the intention of the Government to circumscribe even further the rights of local authorities to spend the money which they raise or which they receive in the form of rate support grant and other permissions from the Government.<br><br>
We find this legislation unnecessary and unacceptable and we shall vote against it. We also feel that the Government's case is a form of approach to government which is not in keeping with what used to be called the one nation, consensus-type Conservatism which the Minister was once alleged to have espoused. I appreciate that the demands of office probably impose on him constraints against which he is not prepared to strike out, but there are other apparently sensitive Conservatives who may join with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has travelled the road from Tranent to Morningside, or wherever he travels to nowadays, and this could be compared to the road to Damascus as far as his political conversion is concerned. We have to give up all hope of the possibility that he will return to the days when he demanded that East Lothian county council spend whatever money was available on anything for the benefit of East Lothian. Those days seem long past.<br><br>
You will remember from the Second Reading, Mr. Gourlay, which was quoted quite copiously by my hon Friend the present Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), the attempts in the past when the hon Member for Edinburgh, South, who was at that time the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, was very keen that items of capital expenditure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
should be undertaken by the then East Lothian county council. I was just despairing of the hope that that particular individual, who at one time had a record in favour of this type of expenditure, would have changed his mind. But as I say, I despair of him. However, there are one or two others who may join with us in defeating what we regard as probably the most objectionable part of a thoroughly objectionable Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised at the hon Gentleman's peroration that this is the most objectionable part of an objectionable Bill. It seems that each time we come to a clause, it is the most objectionable part of an objectionable Bill. I am not sure what conclusion we ought to come to about the earlier clauses now that they have been superseded by clause 23 and the hon Gentleman's chamber of horrors. No doubt we can assume that there is at least a modest degree of hyperbole in the hon Gentleman's approach to these matters and that we are not really expected to take him too seriously in his emotional condemnation of the Bill and all it stands for. [Hon Members: "Resign."] as I am not sure whom hon Gentlemen want to resign, in the context of what I have said.<br><br>
The hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) suggested that the Secretary of State would wish to use the provisions of the clause to deal with the projects of individual local authorities. I made it clear—as I did at the last meeting of the Committee—that that is not the Government's intention, and that specific consents for individual projects apply only either in the exceptional case of an authority such as Lothian, which is the only one of all Scottish local authorities which has had general consent withdrawn, or in respect of the urban renewal programme, which has always involved a system of specific consents, and which therefore has to be dealt with in this way.<br><br>
Turning to the remarks of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), he either has not read the clause or he has misunderstood it. A number of his remarks are simply in the face of the expressed provisions of the clause. He suggested, for example, that this would interfere with the long-term projects to which a local authority might have become legally committed. If the hon Gentleman reads the clause, he will see that legally binding contracts are specifically exempt from the provisions, and there is no way in which the Secretary of State can use any power within the clause to deal with those matters that are legally binding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not use the expression "legally binding". I referred to long-term rolling programmes where there were intentions to commit moneys, and if there was an interruption in them because of the scrutiny, it could result in additional expenditure through interruption to the programme. I made no reference to legally binding contracts in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon Gentleman has clarified that, but it does not really assist his case because if we are dealing simply with long-term rolling programmes that are not legally binding, the hon Gentleman will appreciate that his own Government's approach to capital allocations was in no way to give any assurance to a local authority as to what its capital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0846">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
allocation would be, other than for the immediately following year. It is certainly the case that local authorities have asked successive Governments to give an assurance of capital allocations for a number of years ahead. No Governments have felt able to do that, for obvious reasons relating to the Governments' overall economic policies. So nothing new is being introduced so far as that aspect is concerned.<br><br>
Reverting to the remarks of the hon Member for Provan on the question of leasing—the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire also raised this—it is not a matter which I would have thought was in very substantial dispute. For example, we have evidence in the most recent years of substantial projects which local authorities have contemplated financing through leasing arrangements. Grampian regional council, for example, wished to finance the Bridge of Don showground project by what in effect was a leasing arrangement which would have involved a £10 million commitment. It desisted from doing so when it was pointed out that that would obviously have to be taken into account as part of its general capital allocation, although it did not come within the section 94 consent. But in very substantial items there is clearly an attraction for leasing. We are not seeking to prevent leasing. If a local authority believes that that is a sensible way of entering into a particular project, that is perfectly satisfactory. We are simply saying that if the nature of the leasing arrangements in effect is to provide for a substantial item of capital expenditure it is right that it should be within the general provision of the capital expenditure aspects of legislation introduced by the previous Government, and that is a sensible arrangement.<br><br>
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire suggested that the Secretary of State's approach in these matters would be to go over each item of a local authority's capital expenditure. There has never been any such intention. Given the general block consents of all but one local authority which I receive at the present time, there is no means by which the Secretary of State would have such a detailed scrutiny, nor would he wish to. There would be no advantage to him or to the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that in deciding the block consent the Secretary of State adds up the figures for individual items? Although a block consent may be made, it is in the Secretary of State's mind how that block is compiled and by which specific items and elements. Surely the hon Gentleman is not denying that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman can be forgiven for being irrelevant. He has only just joined the Committee. Otherwise, he would be aware that we are not talking about how the Secretary of State decides the allocation given to a local authority. We are on clause 23, which is concerned with the extent to which the Secretary of State during the course of a year might vary or withdraw a consent to an authority.<br><br>
I repeat that once the Secretary of State has given a capital allocation to an authority he is, with the single exception of Lothian regional council, not remotely concerned with the detailed scrutiny of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
individual projects within that capital consent. That is the whole point of the system. It is not a statutory system, but one that represents the practice of the Secretary of State. The hon Gentleman shakes his head, but it happens to be true. If the hon Gentleman has a particular example which illustrates that this is untrue I shall be happy to give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of examples where local authorities over the year, in spite of getting block consents, have had to put up specific justifications to the civil servants in St. Andrew's House, presumably at the behest of the Secretary of State, for approval, detailed examination and consideration where questions have been raised about specific items. I suggest that he could get rid of many of his civil servants if he did not require such detailed consideration of all aspects of capital allocation.<br><br>
I saw yesterday the programme "Yes Minister" and it is absolutely true. The Minister does not know what is going on in his own Department. These civil servants know exactly, and they are checking up on each individual item, whatever the Minister may say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman should recall that the programme to which he referred is based on the Crossman Diaries, and it may well accurately represent what went on under previous Labour Governments. It does not necessarily accurately represent what goes on in the present Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill </span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made the point that Lothian has been the recipient of this treatment because of its apparent profligacy in the eyes of the Secretary of State. Would he concede that Lothian region nearly doubled last year what he would have regarded as a reasonable rate increase and may well now be followed by Strathclyde, which is likely to double this year what has been regarded as the target by the Scottish Office in setting its rates rise at 35½ per cent? If Lothian was subject to that treatment last year, is it not possible that, in the spiteful way in which the Secretary of State is operating at the moment, Strathclyde could be subject to the same treatment this year, because it will have doubled its rates over the level which the Minister would have regarded as acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman seeks either to ignore or has forgotten the difference between Lothian region and almost every other local authority in Scotland, including every other Labour local authority. Lothian region is the only authority that, to any significant extent, planned for growth on its expenditure last year and is planning again for growth in the budget which is before the council today. Strathclyde regional council is not planning for growth and has, indeed, introduced a substantial number of economies in its expenditure. Therefore, for the hon Gentleman to draw a spurious comparison between the two is not only incorrect, and is not only objected to by me but I suspect would be greatly resented by Strathclyde regional council if it were to hear the hon Gentleman's comments. In some respects it has been as uncomplimentary about the Lothian regional council as the Government—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very complimentary about Strathclyde. He said that it had introduced a number of economies, as indeed it has. Will he then explain to the Committee why the rates are to go up by such a substantial amount and why its expenditure will be £36 million over the Government guidelines? Is it not the case that Strathclyde is a responsible authority and that in order to maintain a reasonable degree of service it has to go substantially over the guidelines? Are not the guidelines totally unrealistic, and will the Minister not admit that now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that the Minister would possibly be out of order if he were to do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with part of what the hon Gentleman said. I am perfectly happy to compliment Strathclyde—or, indeed, any local authority in Scotland—compared with Lothian region. Almost every other authority in comparison has been the supreme epitome of responsibility in local government matters. I do not dispute that a considerable number of local authorities, including Strathclyde, could, in the Government's view, make substantially greater economies. Their reluctance to do so has been the main cause of the rates decisions that they have come to.<br><br>
I return to clause 23. It is not intended to overturn, nor will its provisions result in overturning, the capital consents system that has been pursued by successive Governments over the last few years. That system is continued at this moment, and all local authorities in Scotland, apart from Lothian, benefit from it. Nothing in the clause will change that system. Hon Gentlemen have been correct in saying that for the most part it has worked reasonably well. We are concerned with relatively minor amendments that will improve the system and ensure that the Secretary of State's legitimate right to determine the aggregate of expenditure is more effectively promoted. That is the purpose of the clause. If hon Gentlemen wish to vote against it, that is their right. But they cannot suggest that by so doing they are defending the broad principle of the capital allocations system, which the Government do not dispute and do not wish to overturn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will reply to the Minister. I am not confident enough to reply, except to reflect the impression, which we have had throughout the proceedings on the Bill, that the Government are out to get their bogy man—the Lothian regional council. The bogy man at national level is my right hon Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn). Now they have to get a local bogy man, and it is the Lothian regional council.<br><br>
If one examines all the arguments on the clause and the proposed amendments, one feels that the overall effect, not only of the clause but of the Bill, is to create sufficient vagueness—what the Government call flexibility—in the powers of the Secretary of State to make him a virtual dictator over local authority expenditure, whether current or capital. The clause is part of that overall picture.<br><br>
When the clause was debated on Second Reading, the Secretary of State went out of his way to say that it would not be used, except in extreme cases. But my hon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South indicated that this power was already in operation. Presumably the Minister would say that it was in operation under the previous Government, and that it is therefore all right.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South quoted examples of a moratorium having already been imposed on the housing corporation and other projects in the Lothian region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder to whom my hon Friend is referring. Does he mean my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. My hon Friend is quite right.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) referred to the possible effect of this proposition on housing. I mention that because from a written answer on 14 January column 581 of <i>Hansard</i>—I ascertained that, in the new types, there was already a moratorium on 196 houses in East Kilbride, 65 in Glenrothes, and 16 in Irvine. Of that total of 227 houses on which a moratorium had been imposed by the Secretary of State, 12 were for wheelchair users—10 in Glenrothes and two in Irvine. In this, the International Year of Disabled People, it is intolerable that the Secretary of State is using that power. Whether or not previous Governments had it, I guess that it would never be exercised in the field of the provision of houses for the disabled.<br><br>
According to a Shelter survey, of 67 local authorities in England and Wales, it was revealed that the number of new council homes started for disabled people in 1978 was down by 32 per cent, compared with an average cut in starts of 23 per cent. Shelter estimated—and this is for England—that 250 disabled persons would lose their chance of an independent life in their own home as a result.<br><br>
Can the Minister give us comparable figures for Scotland? Can he indicate how many local authorities are not being allowed to provide sheltered homes for the disabled or for the old under the terms of the moratorium that is already applied?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no moratorium in Scotland, so the problem does not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have this answer to the question, that the moratorium applies in the new towns—the answer to the question that I just quoted. The Minister was not listening—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the answer to the last question that I asked, that there is no moratorium on local authority housing—sheltered housing, or any kind. I am much obliged for that. But will it apply under the terms of this new provision? Will the Secretary of State have power to say that the local authority shall not go on with new housing, either new or projected, in the future as a consequence of this power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is not giving all the information. Is my hon Friend aware that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0848">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
because of a substantial cut in real terms in the grants to the housing corporations, local authorities will not be able to have sheltered housing provided through housing associations? The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but my information is that there will be a substantial cut in sheltered housing provision available through housing associations because of the cutbacks made by the Scottish Office in the grants to the housing corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting wide of the clause 23 stand part debate. We are not discussing housing. We are discussing the question of the withdrawing of authority or consent by the Secretary of State. We should come back to clause 23.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only point that I wanted to make was that a moratorium already existed for the provision of houses for disabled people in the new towns, and that in this Year of Disabled People it is an absolute scandal and, disgrace, and indefensible.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still dissatisfied with the Minister's explanation of how this clause will be operated by the Secretary of State. Having listened to his reply to the debate, which is what drew me to my feet, I consider it an inadequate reply. What few clues we have about the operation of the clause are found in earlier debates on amendments. They are fragmentary and do not in themselves give an entire picture.<br><br>
In one last effort, may I recap what I understand to be the position. The Minister said at our last sitting that clause 23 was
<br><blockquote><p>"a response by the Government to tidy up the control over capital consent. Indeed, these provisions if approved by the Committee would simply make the position in Scotland comparable to that elsewhere in the United Kingdom."— <i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19 February 1981; c. 554.]</p></blockquote>
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) made the point that that is not in itself a substantial argument.<br><br>
I want to focus for a moment on the words "tidy up". I presume that they mean that there will be no radical departure from the system as we know it, and that the primary purpose—this phrase is repeated in the subsequent columns—is merely to alter in detail a system which has existed for some time and is familiar to us—the block grant system. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the same way as the Secretary of State already can with bodies directly under his responsibility, if, during the year, the overall cash limit for that area of expenditure looked like being exceeded, it would be sensible for him to try to trim the consents in order to ensure that the overall consent was maintained … Therefore, expenditure which one had expected to incur in the following financial year may fall to be paid in the current year."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to advance the argument that in a circumstance like that the use of the power to withdraw or vary consent would be brought into play in order to ensure that there was not overspending. As I understand it, he said that was the primary purpose.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say, when challenged by me:
<br><blockquote><p>"I fully understand. Let me be perfectly frank with the Committee"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
Words like that always send a shiver down my spine. He did not go on to be frank or explicit with the Committee, because we were told:
<br><blockquote><p>"I will say later whether as Secretary of State there are other ways in which he can use these powers available to him."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19 February 1981; c. 555-56.]</p></blockquote>
In fact, he was remarkably coy and unexplicit about what these "other ways" were.<br><br>
If the variation or withdrawal of consent, given the normal block grant situation, is merely to ensure that the total spent by a local authority is held at the figure for which consent was given for that year, and will not be distorted by an over-speedy works programme drawing into that financial year part of rolling programme expenditure which has been planned for the next year, I shall be satisfied that some of the more sinister interpretations that have been put on the clause are unjustified. I can see that if a local authority is committed by the Secretary of State to a ceiling of £30 million, and perhaps—the Under-Secretary makes this point—through mistake or unexpected circumstances, but not malice, that £30 million will be exceeded, there may be a case for varying the consent or even in exceptional circumstances of withdrawing some of the consents in order to ensure that that £30 million ceiling is adhered to.<br><br>
The machinery for doing that is rather mysterious, because if the local authority has consent only for £30 million it seems to me that it could be restrained from spending over that. I do not see that cutting back on the £30 million consent for that year has much practical impact in terms of the primary aims which I have just outlined. If that is all that is intended, fine. Indeed, 1 can think of other circumstances in which variation or withdrawal of consent might have some use.<br><br>
For example, much more common historically than overspending has been underspending. There might be a local authority with £30 million consent, which clearly as the returns came in month by month, was never going to spend its £30 million. The Government might well vary the block consent and reduce it to £26 million or £27 million, and take the £3 million or £4 million which is tied up in the consent and will never be used, and redistribute it among authorities which will be able to create facilities by spending the money. If that were the aim of the clause, I should be extremely happy. I do not understand the mechanism, but if that is all it is, I do not find it too dangerous. To try to ensure that there is no waste because of underspending, because of unused capacity on the consents that have been given, is fair enough.<br><br>
I am worried by the frankness that was never forthcoming from the Under-Secretary. He refers somewhat delphically to the exceptional circumstances in which the Secretary of State would be prepared to reduce a consent which had been given for the year, in terms of ensuring that less money was spent than was originally intended. He has not explained the circumstances in which that will be done.<br><br>
What I put to the hon Gentleman in an earlier debate, and what is still in my mind very fully at the moment, is that this will be used not to tidy up, not in order to rationalise or to get into good order planned capital expenditure, but as another sanction in exactly the same way as we have seen, for example, with the housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0849">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 597</span>
capital allowances to certain Government policies on rents. At some future date these clause 23 provisions may well be used in terms of moral blackmail and open financial threat to local authorities whose revenue spending has aroused the suspicion or attracted the disapproval of the Secretary of State. He will come along—no doubt very illogically but, I believe, quite effectively—to local authorities, saying "If you do not follow certain policies on the revenue side, we will start attacking—in exactly the same way as we have attacked your housing revenue account—your capital consent by using clause 23 powers. We will come along and say we will vary or withdraw and cut back, not because we think you cannot use your capital consent, not because we think that your rolling programme is going too fast and there may be an unintentional overspend because of circumstance, but as a sanction, because you are a sinner in our view in terms of your revenue spending."<br><br>
We think that this is another of these blunderbus sanctions which have been strewn so freely around the local government structure by the Government over the last year or 18 months. There is every reason, given the record of the Minister for harbouring these dark suspicions. Whether it will be used or not, it is a weapon that will be there and a weapon which I fear will be flourished in the way that I have described. We might not feel so strongly about the clause if there was a better record of relationship between local government and the central Government—if, to put it bluntly, there was a relationship of trust and mutual understanding. But given the record of this Administration and given the kind of use to which I believe an unscrupulous Secretary of State could put the machinery which we are now including in the statute, it is thoroughly unsafe to do so. I at least will vote against this provision with vim and vigour and with a totally free conscience.</span></p>

REPEAL OF SPECIAL LICENSING PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF NEW TOWNS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 11, line 7, at end add
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"and where a proposal for licensed premises has been approved by a New Town Licensing Planning Committee and confirmed by the Secretary of State under section 49 of the said Act but no licence has been granted by the relevant licensing board the said approval and confirmation shall be held to have no effect and any such proposal will then be subject to the normal licensing procedures under the said Act".</p></blockquote>
My hon Friends and I do not object to the central intention of the clause but I believe that the amendment would be particularly helpful to Scottish new towns, and I have received representations from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council. Clause 24 repeals the special licensing provisions in respect of new towns contained in part IV of Schedule 3. Section 49 relates to the procedure for the submission to an approval by the Secretary of State of proposals by a new town licensing planning committee for the establishment of licensed premises which have been built or are to be built in its area. In particular, subsection (9) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Proposals … may be varied or revoked by subsequent proposals formulated by the committee and submitted to and confirmed by the Secretary of State in like manner as the original proposals".</p></blockquote>
Confirmed section 49 proposals for the establishment of licensed premises have to be followed up by an application to the licensing board for the grant of a licence for the premises, but there is no limit within which the application is to be made.<br><br>
For premises outwith the new town area, the licensing board can refuse to grant a licence on three grounds. This first is that the premises are not suitable or convenient for the sale of alcoholic liquor, having regard to their location, their character and condition, the nature and extent of the proposed use of the premises, and the persons likely to resort to the premises. The second is that the use of the premises for the sale of alcoholic liquor is likely to cause undue public nuisance or a threat to public order and safety. The third is that, having regard to the facilities of the same or a similar kind already available in the locality, or to the facilities of the same or similar kind in respect of which the provisional grant of a new licence is in force and therefore which are to be provided in the locality, the grant of an application would result in the over-provision of such facilities.<br><br>
However, in the case of confirmed section 49 proposals, the licensing board has very little discretion and must grant the application if the effect is that premises would be licensed in accordance with confirmed section 49 proposals. The only substantial grounds of refusal would relate to the suitability of the applicant, and the suitability of the premises would be a very minor point.<br><br>
The situation exists in Cumbernauld new town area where a number of section 49 proposals have been confirmed by the Secretary of State but no application has yet been made to the licensing board for grants of licences. It has been a practice of Cumbernauld development corporation to submit to the licensing planning committee proposals for the establishment of licensed premises well in advance of development, and subsequently when the development is under way or completed it has arranged for the licence to be taken up by a tenant.<br><br>
In Westfield, which is a district of the new town, section 49 proposals for a public house had been con
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0850">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
firmed in 1976 and an application for the grant of the licence was made to the licensing board only last year. There was considerable opposition from residents. Indeed, strong representations were made to me. People were dismayed to find that because the proposals submitted by the licensing planning committee had been approved by the Secretary of State some years ago at a time when there were no houses even in the area, the hands of the licensing board were tied in that respect and it was powerless to refuse to grant the licence on the ground that the premises were not in a suitable location.<br><br>
In this case, the premises would have been situated between Westfield primary school and the site of the new St. Francis of Assisi school. In the circumstances, the licensing board asked the licensing planning committee to revoke the proposals and the licensing planning committee was subsequently able to do so using the provisions of section 49(9).<br><br>
However, once licensing planning committees are abolished under clause 24, there will, on the present proposals, be no machinery for varying or revoking any section 49 proposals already confirmed, no matter how long ago they were confirmed and what changes have taken place in relation to the development of the new town in the meantime. There are eight outstanding confirmed proposals within the new town district.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The district council and the licensing board have asked me to say to the Committee that they recommend that provision should be made in the Bill that, when licensing planning committees are abolished, all outstanding section 49 proposals which have been confirmed but have not yet been followed up by the grant of a new licence by a licensing board should cease to have effect. Subsequently, anyone wishing for a licence for those particular premises should have to come to the licensing board in the normal manner. That would allow residents in the neighbourhood to exercise their statutory rights of objection if they felt that the premises were wrong for the grant of a licence.<br><br>
That is a perfectly reasonable request by any community. I fully support it and I know that my hon Friends will support it. I hope that the Minister will feel able to say that the Government, even if they do not accept the amendment, accept the principle and will come back with their own proposal. But I hope that they will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am able to give the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) instant reassurance. His amendment is, in fact, unnecessary. The clause makes no provision for licensing planning committee proposals to have any force after the abolition of the committees. As soon as the Bill is enacted, local licensing boards will no longer be required to have regard to proposals made by the committees, whether or not they have been confirmed by the Secretary of State. So the normal licensing procedures will, in any event, take effect immediately. I hope that, with that assurance, the hon Gentleman will report back to his local authority and local community that what they seek to achieve will be achieved by the excellent provisions of this excellent Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) was right to raise this matter. Detailed representations were made by one of the new town corporations. Clearly, it will want to look at what the Minister has said and may want clarification to satisfy itself that there is no further difficulty. If that is the position—I do not doubt for a moment what the Minister has said—we shall all be happy to let the matter lie. But perhaps the Minister will consider whether some consultation with the new towns between now and Report would be helpful to make certain that everyone is satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course we shall be happy to give the new towns any information that they seek from us. But I assure the hon Gentleman that the effect of the clause will be as I have indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurance to me and his subsequent assurance to my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all know Cumbernauld new town, and this matter will feature prominently in the <i>Cumbernauld News.</i> Is it not a little incredible that a new town development corporation should be in the position, rightly or wrongly, of having to go to all this length and for us to sit and listen to an excellent speech from my hon Friend when in fact they do not even know or have not had it explained to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the provisions of the Bill have been published for many months. If the new town development corporation in question had contacted the Scottish Office about this matter, we would have been happy to have provided the explanation that has been given. But this is a particular matter of detail which has arisen from this clause. The hon Gentleman has raised it. I have reassured him. I am not quite sure what the fuss is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might lose this assurance. First of all, the representations were from the local authority. The local authorities in new towns are very anxious to have some of the functions of the development corporations and, quite rightly, they welcome the intention of the clause. They do work in close consultation with the development corporation and some of the representatives on the local authority serve on the development corporation. So the point I am making to the Minister is in support of the views expressed by my hon Friends the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is making it worse. We are all agreed on the point he is raising. But I want to confess that I misquoted and put the blame on the development corporation. It seems to me quite incredible that a responsibel local authority, not one of the worst in Scotland, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best.</span></p>

between a responsible local authority, and a new town corporation and the Government is such that we have had this amendment this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may assist the Committee. I can assure the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan, who seems to be getting into a lather about this relatively minor point, that there was consultation by the Secretary of State both with COSLA and with the new town development corporations, and all these matters were available to be explained in the normal process of consultation. COSLA has agreed to this clause. The new towns do not appear to be as concerned as the hon Gentleman is about it. It is not our fault that a particular local authority seeks to approach its own MP to ask a question of a Committee. After all, this is what the Committee stage is supposed to be about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seem to recall that I started to withdraw the amendment. Having been given an assurance by the Minister that the intention of the clause meets the terms of my amendment, and given that he has assured my hon Friends the Members for Garscadden and for Provan that he will ensure that the relevant licensing authorities are aware of their powers as a consequence of the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ABOLITION OF SCOTTISH RIVER PURIFICATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE </div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no amendment to clause No. 25 because there is no real option. Either we abolish this body, which is what the Government want, or we do not, which is what I want. I hope that my hon Friends will support me on keeping the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee. I hope that my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who has a particular interest in this matter is able to participate.<br><br>
This clause is put in as part of the quango cull on which the Government are intent. It is part of the pressure that is being brought from above to reduce the number of these so-called quangos. I am not totally against reducing the number of quangos. There are some quangos which spend a great deal of money, whose existence is not necessarily beneficial and which could be done away with. The Tory Party is not a quango but could well be done away with. But those that I am thinking of particularly are the new town development corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing any point other than the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee, which is to be abolished by the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know that perfectly well, Mr. Gourlay, but I am talking about the quango cull of which this is part. This is the River—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not concerned with the quango cull. We are concerned only with whether clause 25 should stand part of the Bill and anything relevant to the committee which is mentioned in clause 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that perhaps I should speak more quietly. The Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee is in my view one of the most useful bodies. It is not one of the big spenders—quite the reverse. It is one of the small spenders. What will the Secretary of State save as a result of this legislation?<br><br>
I wonder, incidentally, how much it will cost to have this committee wound up. Certainly, how much it will save is infinitesimal compared with some of the other quangos which I am not allowed to mention. The cost estimated in the report was £1,394. That is what the Secretary of State plans to save, £1,394, in comparison with the billions of pounds spent by the Scottish Office each year.<br><br>
I argue that this kind of quango is different from the<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
;</div> <!-- sub --> other types. It is difficult to argue a case for this body without comparing it with others, but that is your requirement, Mr. Gourlay. This body has a particular role. Like others, it consists of people who have expertise in the subject, and who are willing to give that expert advice to the Government on a totally unpaid basis. In a letter to me the Under-Secretary of State said—I think that this is also included in the notes on the clause—that advice on river purification can be obtained from other sources, such as the purification board. But the board deals only with specific areas. The Under-Secretary mentions the civil servants who work for the Secretary of State. But those people are looking at the matter from a particular point of view—that of civil servants.<br><br>
I do not want to carry out my usual tirade against civil servants. Some of my best friends are civil servants. But I suggest that the advice given by civil servants is tinged with a particular point of view. What the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee does is to give national advice. It gives advice covering the whole country. It gives independent advice, because it is not beholden to the Secretary of State in the way that civil servants are. Over the years since 1951 the board has given valuable advice. It is not the kind of quango that produces large, expensive, glossy annual reports. It meets from time to time with its expenses paid. There is no payment to the individual, no remuneration but expenses, and the committee gives a broad range of advice.<br><br>
It seems to me petty-minded and mean in the extreme that the Secretary of State, in order to save £1,394, does away with this valuable committee. If the situation with regard to river pollution in Scotland as a whole was so wonderful that the Secretary of State did not need advice on pollution, I could understand it. But that is not the case. In fact, the Clyde river purification board, in its most recent annual report, says that some of the progress that has been made Over the past few years under previous Governments in getting rid of river pollution, is now beginning to be lost. It says that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0852">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
are signs of a regression in the matter of pollution, principally due to the public expenditure cuts relating to sewage which is being poured into rivers as it was not before. All this is because river purification boards have to cut back their expenditure.<br><br>
I was particularly sorry to see the Strathclyde regional council, which is a Labour council, supporting major cuts in purification measures on the river Clyde. The effect will be that there will be fewer inspectors working for the purification board. Vacancies are not being filled, and as a result the rivers are becoming more and more polluted. Farmers cannot be monitored —with no disrespect to my hon Friend—and factories cannot be monitored. Therefore, the purification situation is becoming worse. Rather than thinking of abolishing the advisory committee, the Secretary of State should be thinking of strengthening it, and he should be looking at ways of giving it more power, or, if it has no power, giving it some power not just to offer advice but to do something more substantial.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend not think it unlikely that the Government should want to increase the effectiveness or powers of this body in view of the fact that only last year the Scottish Office sent out a circular to river purification boards indicating the desirability of cutting back on expenditure and reducing standards? I raised this in the House in respect of the river Tweed last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The raising or lowering of standards docs not fall within this "stand part" debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose, then, that I am unable to reply to my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), except to say that I agree with him. The abolition of this advisory committee is one of these mean-minded, small things which we have come to expect from the present Government. It will save so little money, as I said earlier. It will be infinitesimal in the total budget of the Scottish Office. I hope that my colleagues, including my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, will be able to vote against it.<br><br>
I should like to give one particular example of river pollution while the advisory committee has not even been allowed to meet. This is an important point. The Secretary of State has been immorally and, I think, almost illegally refusing permission for the present committee to meet, having given an instruction to the chairman of the committee, which has been enforced for well over a year, that because this legislation was pending it should not meet. This is anticipation of legislation far beyond reason. It is lamentable that the Secretary of State should be so dictatorial and so unconcerned about pollution in Scotland that because he has an intention which has not been put through yet, which must still go through discussions here and in the other place, and because it is down in draft form, he refuses to let the advisory committee meet. While the advisory committee has been unable to meet, we have seen the worst example of river pollution in Scotland that has ever taken place. That is in the river Girvan. I have written to the Under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
Secretary of State and the Secretary of State on a number of occasions about the pollution of the river Girvan and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is not permitted in this debate to go into the details of what happens in the river Girvan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have raised this matter on a number of occasions, Mr. Gourlay. Far be it from me to challenge your ruling, but we are discussing clause 25 and the abolition of the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee. Therefore, we must be discussing all aspects of the work of that committee, which includes advising the Secretary of State on matters such as the pollution of the river Girvan. On the previous occasion, you would not allow me to draw innumerable examples. All I am asking on this occasion is to draw one example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the committee referred to in clause 25 has no particular responsibilities or powers in respect of the river Girvan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would contest that, Mr. Gourlay. I understand that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon Gentleman is challenging my ruling, there is a method of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am sure that my hon Friend does not want to contest your ruling in a formal sense, but surely if we are discussing the abolition of a body we must be in a position to discuss what that body does. I would have thought that if a river purification advisory committee is set up it must obviously have an interest in the standards which are imposed on local authorities, industry and others in terms of the purity of rivers. It might be that it was a very ineffective body. That might be the Minister's answer.<br><br>
I quite accept that we do not want a learned debate on river purification, but surely we are allowed to refer to the role of this body and to comment on whether its abolition is desirable or undesirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the way in which the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has put the point is correct, but there is a limit as to how far one can digress to that extent in a clause stand part debate of this nature. That body is not responsible for the purification of the river in detail —it is the river board which is responsible to it. The committee may advise the various river purification boards in Scotland, and to that extent it would be relevant to make some reference, but not a detailed reference as though if the committee were to be abolished it would make any difference to the river Girvan or the river Forth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would argue, Mr. Gourlay, that it would. I do not know whether you have had an opportunity to read the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act 1951. Section 1(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to promote the cleanliness of the rivers and other inland waterways and tidal waters of Scotland."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0853">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 605</span>
The river Girvan is an inland waterway of Scotland and the Secretary of State has a duty to promote its cleanliness. Subsection (2) says that he shall appoint a river purification advisory committee to advise him on this matter. So it would seem self-evident prima facie—whatever my legal hon Friends want to talk about—that the pollution of the river Girvan is something that the Secretary of State has a concern for, and that he has one advisory board to advise him on this—or which should be advising him on this—and that is the river purification advisory committee. He is proposing to abolish it, presumably because he thinks that he does not need any advice. I was trying to argue, Mr. Gourlay, if you are prepared to listen to me, that there is one example which shows very clearly that he does need advice on river purification. That one example—I use no other—is the river Girvan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware I am not under any instruction or even guidance on how to vote on this issue. I know that my hon Friend has a serious problem in the river Girvan, and we are all aware of his reason for raising this matter, but can he tell me whether the advisory board offered any opinion on the current problem of the river Girvan? It seemed to me that that would be a legitimate point to bring out in the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon Friend raised that matter, because it is precisely the point that I was going on to make. I consulted the chairman of the advisory committee and said that I thought that the pollution of the river Girvan was the worst ever seen in Scotland and was a suitable subject for the consideration of his committee and giving advice to the Secretary of State. John Reid, the chairman, agreed with me and proposed to call a meeting of the committee specifically to discuss the pollution of the river Girvan. The Secretary of State refused to allow him to call such a meeting. That is the point that I was trying to make, and have now been able to make, thanks to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
When there is a situation of the worst pollution Scotland has ever seen, when there is iron oxide in a river which is killing all the fish, when one has alginate industries whose production is jeopardised by the pollution of the river, when every local authority in the area is up in arms, the fishermen are up in arms, the community council, and everyone is furious about what is happening, and the Secretary of State refuses to allow advisory council currently in existence to meet, is it not ridiculous?<br><br>
The right hon Gentleman is frightened of the advice that the committee will give him. It will say that the pollution is despicable, that it is causing tremendous problems. Tourism is concerned. Something ought to be done about it. He does not want that advice. I suggest that he wants to abolish the committee not to save the £1,394 but because it wants to give him advice that he does not want to hear. [Hon Members: "Hear, hear."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman finished on a resounding note. He appealed to his hon Friends, but he was slightly melodramatic in his approach. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
can assure him that if any Secretary of State simply abolished advisory committees on the grounds that they might occasionally advise him to do things that he did not want to do, there would be very few quangos in existence today, as the result of successive Governments' response on that basis.<br><br>
The position is quite simply this. The question whether the committee should or should not continue depends purely on the basis of whether there are alternative means whereby the Secretary of State can gain advice on the matters to which the hon Gentleman refers. No one questions for a moment that it is highly desirable that on matters of pollution the Secretary of State should have the advice of those who are in a position to give him useful and helpful advice as to what the appropriate .policy ought to be.<br><br>
There are three ways in which the Secretary of State will continue to receive all the advice that is necessary on these matters. As the hon Gentleman himself says, there are the river purification boards themselves, the people who in respect of each of the rivers concerned are in the best position to know the detailed problems and requirements of those rivers. In addition, there are the technical and professional officers of the Scottish Office, who are qualified in matters of this kind. There is also the Scottish river purification boards' own association. It gives advice and is perfectly free to give advice on matters 'that affect river purification questions as a whole.<br><br>
The question, therefore is this: with three alternative sources of advice to the Secretary of State, is it necessary to have an additional body giving the same sort of advice? The hon Gentleman was quite correct. There will not be huge savings from abolishing this body, but that is not the criterion. The criterion is whether there will be any shortage of advice to the Secretary of State on the matters for which this committee is formally responsible. The Secretary of State will still have numerous sources from which he can receive the information to which the hon Gentleman referred. There will be plenty of bodies and plenty of organisations to advise him on the river Girvan or any other river. Therefore, if advice is required, the hon Gentleman can rest assured that it will still be forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the association for the purification boards, to which .the Minister has just referred, have statutory rights to be consulted or to give advice to the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt very much that it has. Neither does the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. But that does not prevent it giving advice, and Secretaries of State of successive Governments have taken that into account in reaching their decisions. Merely not having a statutory basis is irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will help me by reminding me about the present composition of the threatened body. Who serve on it? Presumably they are appointed by the Secretary of State. Perhaps the hon Gentleman could just tell us who they are and where they come from.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0854">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 607</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not immediately have available a list of the members. It is not a matter that I carry in my head. I shall make that information available to hon Members as soon as it is available to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the fact that the information is not available suggest that this money might be saved elsewhere, rather than by abolishing this committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon Gentleman that the composition of the advisory committee was not a relevant consideration in deciding whether it should or should not continue. If it was, that would be information which I ought to have immediately in order to advise hon Gentlemen. I understand that there are a number of independents on the board, and there are representatives of the purification boards and some members of local authorities, who after consultation with COSLA were appointed to the committee. If the hon Gentleman is interested I shall send him a list of the names of the people concerned.<br><br>
The important point at issue is whether advice will be available to the Secretary of State. I hope that what I have said has indicated that there will be no shortage of advice on the river Girvan and on other rivers. On that basis, there is no logical reason why that committee should continue in existence.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I came to this matter with no preconceived notions. I am not opposed to disbandment of committees that are not needed. Committees can sometimes be pompous and self-perpetuating. There are occasions when I think that they could be laid decently to rest.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) said that he had had no instructions. The Opposition normally do not give instructions. We try to make up our minds fairly objectively on the basis of the evidence before us. I am not as yet convinced by the Minister's arguments. It is not the amount of advice that is available to the Minister— every Government Department is full of advice—but the range and sources of advice that are important.<br><br>
Of course, there will be many technical officers and many people with views and opinions within the Department. I do not doubt for a moment that those views will be founded on a great deal of knowledge. But there may be an interest. This is not in any way a personal charge. I think that inevitably Ministries internally will have views. They will want a policy to be followed and they will come to a conclusion as to what is in the interests of the Government and the Administration of the day. It is not necessarily on political grounds, because this is not necessarily a politically contentious area of debate. But certainly in terms of expenditure and of the policy that is to be followed, the Minister may very well be getting slanted advice and it may well be that he will therefore be following a certain line of policy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 608</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon Gentleman listened carefully to what I said. I was not simply saying that we would have advice from within the Scottish Office. We also have the River Purification Board and the Association of River Purification Boards, which represent every possible interest of technical advice to the Secretary of State on the matters covered by this area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. I listened with great care, as I always do, to what the hon Member said. Sometimes I listen with some despair, but I always listen. I do the hon Gentleman that courtesy.<br><br>
There is the Department with which we are dealing which I think he will agree is parti pris to most of these arguments. The River Purification Board was the other main area, with the Association of River Purification Boards. Quite clearly, again, they have a point of view. They must have a point of view. It may well be that some of the advice that ought to be given is critical of the river purification boards and their approach and attitudes.<br><br>
Why I asked' about the membership was not because I want to know that it was Mrs. McQuackle and Councillor Mrs. So-and-So and Mr. The-Next-Thing. That is of no interest to me at the moment. But it is the area from which they are drawn. As the Minister said, there are a number of what he very helpfully described as "independents" on the present advisory committee. This seems to me to be an area in which independence is something that we should not hastily abolish and something that we could well do with.<br><br>
One has only to listen to the speeches of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). His concern about the state of our rivers is echoed by many people and many bodies. This is an area where contention is real and where there is still a great deal of argument on technical points about the right balance to be struck between the environmental lobby and the industrial lobby, for example. In this kind of area there is a need for independent advice that can look at what is being said by the Minister's advisers, what is said by the river purification boards, to try to get the balance right and to represent a public point of view which is not in any way tramelled by a particular vested interest standpoint.<br><br>
On the basis that that is needed in an area of controversy and that the expenditure is so low, because it does not seem to me that a substantial saving is at risk here, I must confess that my sympathies are largely with my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. I would be inclined to support my hon Friend if he forced this amendment to a vote.<br><br>
The enthusiasm for sweeping away quangos is no doubt all very well and fine. But—and this is a good Conservative motto—I value independent advice and people who can stand aside from Government and criticise and get an oversight of policy in an area. If the advisory committee has that independent element, which I gather from the Minister himself it has, it is worthy of at least some further extension of life until river purification is removed from public controversy and there is greater satisfaction at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0855">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
way in which it is handled by river purification boards, the Government or anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon Friend. I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I am not satisfied with what the Minister has said. All that he has done is to repeat what is in the notes on clauses. I read those carefully and discussed the matter with the chairman of the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee. He is aggrieved that the Secretary of State has not allowed the committee to meet for nearly a year and a half. That is disgraceful and indicative of the Secretary of State's attitude.<br><br>
There are two essential elements of the advisory committee. The first is that it is independent, as my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said. The second, as my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) brought out in bis intervention, is that it has a statutory right—indeed, a duty—to give advice to the Secretary of State. Those are the two essential elements which are not contained in any of the other three areas. For that reason, I hope that the Committee will oppose the clause.</span></p>

ABOLITION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CONSERVATION AND PROVISION OF WATER SUPPLIES ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the notes on clauses so generously provided by the Government, they go out of their way to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has always been difficult to find issues on which the Committee could make a useful contribution and in effect it died nine years ago when the members' terms of office came to an end and no reappointments were made."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether -the Minister has information as to the number of members whose terms of office concluded in those nine years and which were not renewed, and how many members it has currently. The membership would not be large at the outset, and if members have retired, for whatever reason, as this has been going on since 1972, there cannot be many members left.>lb/>
It seems to have been a 'grave dereliction of duty on the part of successive Governments, including the Heath Government, between 1972 and 1974, that this was happening and that work could not be found for this committee to do. The Labour Government— indeed, successive Labour Governments from 1974 onwards—are equally culpable. We have only now found that this committee can be dispensed with.<br><br>
It would be interesting to find out the total cost involved in keeping this committee in being all those years when clearly there was no reason for it to go on. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide the Committee with that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon Member that nine years ago, when the existing terms of office of the then members came to an end, no reappointments were made. Therefore, for the past nine years, although the committee has existed, it has had no membership and has never met. It is not for me to explain why three successive Governments did not take opportunities that might have been available to repeal 'the measure. I can only say that the present Administration are trying to make up for the omission of previous Administrations of both political colours on important issues of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although we may have some doubts about the slaughter of real, live quangos, we are quite prepared to see ghosts laid. On this occasion the Minister has our total support.</span></p>

POSTPONEMENT OF EFFECT OF SECTION 127(3) AND (4) OF THE EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1980</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could give us a word of explanation here. I think that the clause arises out of drafting difficulties in the Act, but could the Minister say a word or two about why we need this so shortly after the original legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A drafting error in the preparation of the Act brought into force subsections (3) and (4) of section 127, the commencement of which had been postponed in the Employment and Training Act 1973. It was a technical mistake, and therefore it was sensible to use this opportunity to rectify it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is to do with the careers service, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why was not the opportunity taken with the Education (Scotland) Bill, which is to start its meanderings soon?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter could have been dealt with in that Bill, but the Bill before us is an earlier piece of legislation, and if an error has been made one takes the first opportunity to correct it.</span></p>
