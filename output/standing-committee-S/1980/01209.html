Colleges of Education in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Younger)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,<br><br>
That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of the colleges of education in Scotland.
I am extremely glad that we have an opportunity to discuss this very important matter, and I am grateful to the Opposition for having suggested it for debate today and given me an opportunity to explain in more detail the decisions I announced on 6 August.<br><br>
There are two main issues upon which I hope all members of the Committee who speak will be able to express an opinion. Firstly, is there or is there not any reason to reduce the size of the teacher-training system in Scotland? Secondly, if it is necessary to reduce the size of that system, what is the best, fairest and most sensible method of doing so?<br><br>
Perhaps I should start by outlining the facts, and let them lead us on to the main issues. The main purpose of colleges of education is, of course, to provide initial training for teachers, and the number of teachers needed must obviously depend upon the number of pupils in our schools. In 1973 there were 636,000 primary pupils in Scotland; by 1979 there were only 545,000; and the number is expected to continue to fall to some 445,000 by 1985 before beginning to rise again.<br><br>
Even on the assumption that there will be some increase in the birth rate, the 1979 figure is unlikely to be reached again before the mid-1990s. The number of secondary pupils is now at its peak of about 410,000 and is expected to fall to about 288,000 by 1990 before starting to rise again.<br><br>
I should emphasise that these changes have not been accompanied by any worsening of pupil-teacher ratios. On the contrary they have steadily improved, and both in primary and in secondary teaching they are now the most favourable in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
But inevitably the drop in the number of pupils is reflected in the number of teachers whom we need to train. In the early 1970s the colleges of education provided pre-service training for about 12,700 student teachers each year; in 1979-80 the number was only 5,455, and by 1983-84 it is expected to fall to about 4,500 before beginning slowly to rise again.<br><br>
The total number of all types of student in colleges of education, which stood at nearly 15,000 in 1972-73, fell to about 8,000 in 1979-80 and is of the order of 7,300 in the current Session. It is likely to go below 7,000 in 1982-83 and is not expected to rise again to any significant extent before the end of the decade—and then only by a few hundred places. These students are at present trained in 10 separate colleges of education, with a total capacity in terms of student places which was originally related to the peak numbers of the early 1970s.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
In 1977, when the last general review of college capacity took place, there were 14,450 places in the college system. The previous Secretary of State, the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan), decided—and I agreed with him—that the right course was to retain the 10-college system but to run down the number of places and students in all the colleges.<br><br>
According to a consultative paper produced by the right hon Gentleman in January 1977, it was thought that a system with an overall capacity of something just under 12,000 would be about right—the actual figure in the paper was 11,900. Since then, the overall capacity has in fact been reduced to about 11,150 places by the diversion of surplus accommodation to other uses. But the fall in the number of pupils in the schools, and so in the number of students needed, has gone even further than was then expected; and in addition, wastage from the profession is less than was envisaged by the right hon Gentleman in 1977.<br><br>
The reality of the position in the 1980s is that even in the reduced college system of 11,150 student places, there are at present nearly 4,000 places unused and surplus to requirements. It is abundantly clear that, if nothing is done about it, there will be even larger surpluses over the next few years. It seems to me to be clear beyond any doubt that it would be a gross waste of resources to continue to train decreasing numbers of student teachers in a system which was designed to accommodate many more, and even worse to train a large number of young teachers who would be most unlikely ever to get jobs in teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell<span class='memberconstituency'>(West Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the figure of 11,000 include the social workers in places like Jordanhill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that figure is the present capacity of the system—not its usage—as it was reduced by the right hon Member for Craigton in his last reform. The theoretical capacity is now 11,150. The total need at present is about 8,000.<br><br>
I am of course fully aware of various educational developments which will have implications for the colleges of education in coming years—for example, the proposals for the curriculum and for assessment which are contained in the Munn and Dunning reports, the proposals in the Warnock report for special education, new developments on in-service training of teachers, and the intention, which I announced in August, to proceed towards all-graduate entry to primary teaching. However, even on the basis of a most generous allowance for these developments and for the other types of student now trained in colleges of education, I have no doubt that an overall capacity of 8,000 student places in the college system will make ample provision for the period into the 1990s.<br><br>
These are the facts which everyone must face up to. They lead us inescapably to the conclusion that some reduction has to be made to the 10-college system. I turn now to the second main issue. If we have to reduce the system—how should it be done?<br><br>
It has been suggested that this situation does not require the closure or amalgamation of any colleges of education, and of course this is a possibility which I have examined very carefully. After the most anxious consideration of all the relevant factors, however,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
I have not felt able to accept that view. The gradual run down which has been taking place in all the colleges over the last few years—by diverting accommodation to other purposes, by diversification of courses where possible, and by reducing staff numbers through a non-selective process of natural wastage and voluntary redundancy—has gone about as far as it reasonably can. Inevitably it has resulted in imbalances of staffing and it has given rise to a situation of increasing frustration and operational difficulties in most if not all colleges.<br><br>
I have been forced to the conclusion that further run down of the college system by these methods would seriously damage their overall ability to provide the educational services which the country is entitled to expect. We have had many complaints from the colleges themselves about the increasing problems involved in spreading a limited—and reducing—intake of students over the existing 10-college system; and, as I have indicated, the necessary skills and experience of academic staff are now inevitably spread very thinly in some areas.<br><br>
Some colleges are already close to the point where, if the present general rundown were to continue, it must be seriously questioned whether they could remain viable. Of course 1 do not want to close any colleges. But the conclusion seems inevitable that, if the colleges of education are to play an effective role in the educational life of Scotland, what is needed now is a more compact system within which student populations, staffing and other resources can be so distributed that the total educational effort can be not only maintained but improved.<br><br>
It has been suggested also that all 10 colleges should be retained on the basis that each of them would be fully utilised either by training greater numbers of teachers or by diversifying into new areas of education, or both. I see no prospect of diversification on the scale that would be required. There have in the past been many proposals for colleges to undertake new functions, but most of these would merely have duplicated provision which is already made perfectly adequately in other institutions such as universities, central institutions or further education colleges. It would be no proper answer to the college of education problem simply to spread it more widely over other tertiary education establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller<span class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Secretary of State is making what is, in his opinion, a case for the closing of colleges on the merits. Is he suggesting that the Government's slashing cuts in education play no part in that decision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: have not actually referred to that side of matters. It has been discussed on many occasions. I am trying to make the case purely in the context of the colleges of education at the moment. I shall refer later to the question of money saving, if t hat is what the hon Gentleman has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon Gentleman taken into account the fact that there will be a massive bulge in the numbers requiring higher education in Scotland—even if we accept that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
there will be no increase in the percentage—when he says that he does not want to give to other tertiary education establishments work which is at present covered by universities and other colleges? Has he taken into account that there will be a need for new buildings and extra staff? Surely the college of education is supposed to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's point. Of course the school population and, indeed, the further education population is subject to troughs and bulges. The trough is moving through the school system at the moment, and the higher numbers at present in further education will decline as that trough moves through into the further education system.<br><br>
I appreciate the hon Gentleman's remarks, but I do not see this as a solution which could be used to keep open colleges of education which would not otherwise be kept open for their main purpose, vecause it would merely spread it further over the rest of the tertiary education system.<br><br>
From the demographic figures which I have already given it is quite obvious that there is no way in which I could justify using the empty space in the colleges of education system simply to increase the output of teachers. As I have already said, pupil— teacher ratios in the schools compare very favourably with those elsewhere. In the primary sector the ratio in 1979-80 was 20.3, compared with 22.7 in England and 21.9 in Wales. In the secondary sector it was 14.4 compared with 16.6 both in England and in Wales. It surely cannot be held that we should use all the existing capacity of the colleges for teacher training whether the teachers are needed or not.<br><br>
Let me now say something about costs. Many people have asked about the details of the savings expected to be made. Although saving money is by no means the only object of these changes it is certainly something we expect to achieve, after the initial costs of closure and redundancy have been met. In the current financial year it is costing £3,750,000 to run the three colleges directly affected. Of course I do not expect to save to all of that sum immediately, but savings there certainly will be. The students in the colleges concerned will be accommodated in spare capacity elsewhere in the system. This will reduce average unit costs because of the savings which will accrue from operating a smaller number of establishments. There will be staff savings too.<br><br>
The extra staff needed at the remaining colleges will be fewer than the existing staff at the colleges to be closed. I cannot be precise at this stage, but I expect that perhaps a quarter of the academic staff will not need to be retained in the system, and with the closing of complete establishments most of the non-academic staff will no longer be required. Capital savings will also arise from the disposal of the buildings for other uses. One does not have to be a very brilliant economist to see that there is scope for considerable savings in those ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman says that he is not able to give precise figures. In fact he has given only one figure of £3¾ million. Will he estimate the revenue savings after taking into account the extra costs involved in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
operation and how far that would be offset by the capital cost involved in the alteration of accommodation, bearing in mind that a good number of buildings may not be capable of disposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much of that has to await the determination of the precise method of closure which will be determined by consultations with those directly involved. There is no use trying to pre-empt that decision because the whole point is to try to get the best solution and timing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing<span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, as the Secretary of State says, one does not have to be a very brilliant economist to know what the savings will be, will he persuade some of his not-very-brilliant economists to publish the figures so that we may all discuss them? May we have an undertaking now that those figures will be published so that we shall all know what the Secretary of State is talking about, and not only those not-very-brilliant economists?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were looking for not very brilliant economists, I should not have to look very far.<br><br>
There is no point in publishing imaginary figures. We shall be happy to publish the figures when we have established the nature of the closures and their timing. Everyone is entitled to know, but we cannot—as the right hon Member for Craigton found a few years ago when he tried to do it—make up costings and proposals until we know the precise details.<br><br>
Unless some colleges close, there is a danger of producing more teachers than we really need simply to keep a 10-college system viable. There is no justification for incurring the additional cost, which would undoubtedly amount to several million pounds, of training teachers who are not needed. I will not contemplate the training of students with no real prospect of employment. If we were to retain a 10-college system whose capacity were not needed, we would inevitably be driven to training more teachers than were needed. That would be not only wasted expenditure but very considerable expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes<span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State keeps referring to teachers who are not needed. Would not local authorities like to employ more teachers to improve the education service but are unable to do so because the Secretary of State is cutting rate support grant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a false point, as the hon Gentleman knows. Expenditure on school education is marginally higher per pupil than it has been in the past. That is because of the falling number of pupils.<br><br>
The conclusion that some colleges must be closed is, in these circumstances, quite inescapable, on educational as much as on financial grounds. Indeed, if I had been considering economic arguments alone, it would no doubt have been tempting to go for a more centralised system, with the 8,000 student places, which is the maximum we need, located in perhaps as few as four or five colleges. That solution would be quite unacceptable to me and, I would have thought, to most other hon Members. There is surely a strong case for trying to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
ensure that our college system covers as wide a geographical spread throughout Scotland as possible, and this has been uppermost in our minds in working out the best solution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Steel<span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State is so certain about his conclusions, why has he been so reluctant to consult the colleges on what to do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point.<br><br>
In reaching my decisions I have therefore put considerable stress on geographical and regional factors. I have considered the circumstances of each college, taking account of the area that it serves and of the feasibility, in the event of its being closed, of maintaining services in some other way. It was clear that the real options for closure were in the central belt, where considerations of distance and the existence of a concentration of colleges make it practicable to plan the continuation of services on a new basis.<br><br>
It is not pleasant to have to decide that any particular college should close. I have, however, concluded that, on the criteria which I have indicated, Hamilton and Callendar Park colleges should close and that it would be appropriate for Craiglockhart to cease to operate as a separate entity and to be merged, preserving a distinct Roman Catholic unit, within another institution.<br><br>
In reaching these decisions I took account of the numbers of students in these colleges, their geographical location, their proximity to other colleges and the feasibility of continuing services which they at present provide. I should like to make it clear that my decisions imply no criticism of the academic performance of any of the colleges in question.<br><br>
We originally thought that it would be right to issue a consultative document and invite another period for public discussion. Later developments, however, led me to conclude that this would not after all be the best way to proceed. My hon Friend the Minister responsible for industry and education, had meetings with a large number of interested bodies and we received a considerable volume of representations about the future of the colleges generally and the circumstances of particular colleges. It was clear that a strong body of opinion throughout the college system was anxious to end the uncertainty.<br><br>
Against this background it seemed to me that it would be disastrous to plunge everyone into dismay and uncertainty by consultation about which colleges should be closed. Everyone would have jumped into action to prove that his own college should be sacrosanct and none would have volunteered to close. All the colleges would have endured a wretched period of insecurity.<br><br>
I felt it as my duty to spare everyone that agony by making the hard decisions to the best of my ability. I stand by these decisions and although I greatly regret their necessity, I am glad to defend them as basically right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart<span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the Secretary of State has arrived at such different conclusions, may I ask him the question that I put to his hon Friend the other day? How has he made these decisions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
and come to these conclusions when Sir Norman Graham's committee—part of whose remit was to advise the Secretary of State on these points—has not yet reported?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are looking at the precise amount of teacher training that will be needed for a known number of pupils. The right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) must accept that the figures I have given this morning make a clear case on this matter. I must rest on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If Craiglockhart, is to be a one-site institution after the merger, what cost allocation has been given by the Scottish Education Department to the establishment and creation of another chapel equal to the present one at Craiglockhart on the new Moray House site?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable point. As the hon Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) may know, this is already a matter of consultation between ourselves and the authorities involved. I hope that a solution will be found.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang<span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State must accept that there is considerable concern in the east of Scotland about the way the discussions with regard to Craiglockhart have been handled. In view of the way that he lumped Craiglockhart with the other two colleges which he has said that he intends to close completely, can he give an assurance that he has not ruled out the possibility of Craiglockhart continuing on its present site, which many of us believe is the right solution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, nothing is ruled out in our discussions. I was not aware of anything unsatisfactory in the consultations, although they are at an early stage. I hope that we can have good and thorough consultations with those concerned and with the other colleges. I pointed out in my earlier statement in August that there would be full consultations with colleges and other affected interests about both the timing of these measures and the means of bringing them into effect. I stress that point again because I regard it as very important. Major questions still have to be settled about the future of students who have already started courses of training, about the maintenance of educational services, including in-service training, currently provided from the colleges to be closed or merged, and of course about the future of the staff involved.<br><br>
Particularly with regard to the continuation of in-service training, I do not rule out the possibility that some sort of base might be retained in areas where colleges are to close. I accept also that everything possible must be done to cushion the effect of closures on students and staff. I am certainly prepared to explore with the governing bodies the possibility that the necessary reduction in staff numbers might be achieved to a substantial extent by voluntary redundancy, although I doubt whether it is possible to do so entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it is the first time that the in-service training element that will be left has been mentioned
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
in public, I think that the Secretary of State is obliged to specify what he means by it. Will the base be in the existing colleges? What facilities will be provided for those operating the in-service work? Will the present college staff be retained to do the work and, if so, how many of them? What will be the cost of maintaining that fairly small base and of providing the facilities at present provided by the colleges which the Secretary of State is closing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, those are relevant and important questions, but I do not think that they should be resolved without consultation with those who are directly involved and are best able to advise how it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We complain about the lack of consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon Gentleman would be particularly pleased to have that suggestion made in public today for the first time. I should be grateful if he would indicate whether he is pleased about it, because it would be useful to all concerned.<br><br>
It is in the interests of all concerned that discussions on all these matters should proceed as quickly as possible. I hope that the colleges involved will cooperate fully to this end.<br><br>
Hon Gentlemen will wish to raise and discuss many detailed aspects of this subject. I have spared the Committee a long speech covering all of them, as 1 know that many hon Members wish to speak. My hon Friend will be glad to cover these points, if asked, in his reply.<br><br>
As I said earlier, I only wish that it were not necessary to make changes affecting particular colleges in a system which is working well and which is served by a large number of highly-dedicated staff. But we all have to face reality, and the reality is that this system is too large for what we need.<br><br>
I hope that hon Members will agree that the case that I have made this morning and the facts which support it amount to an overwhelming case for a reduction in the size of the system. The method of reduction that I have chosen is, I believe, logical and gives the best geographical coverage possible in the circumstances.<br><br>
I fully sympathise with those who will be directly affected by the closure of a college that they greatly value, but I hope that all concerned will now see a smaller but better teacher-training system as being necessary. Everyone in the system is crying out for a firm decision to be taken and then for a period of stability, so that all concerned can carry on doing their job in a most important part of the educational service.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce Millan<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Craigton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Committee will have found his speech a very impressive defence of what the Secretary of State has done.<br><br>
As the Secretary of State said, the debate is being held at the request of the Opposition. I put on record that we also wish to have a debate this month on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
appalling unemployment in Scotland. For various reasons the Secretary of State will not be available for such a debate, so we shall wish to return to that issue in this Committee early in the New Year.<br><br>
It is all the more important that we have this debate this morning in view of the method by which the Secretary of State made his announcement on 6 August. I do not wish to take up valuable time in arguing about the events of that day, but I wish to put it on record that the Secretary of State knows that I expected a normal statement in the House. What is more, I wrote to the Secretary of State more than a fortnight earlier—on 22 July—making that absolutely clear. I never received a reply to that letter— only an acknowledgment. The Secretary of State, nevertheless, slipped in his announcement in a written answer on 6 August.<br><br>
What the Secretary of State has said about the consultative process is a denial of an explicit promise which the Under-Secretary made, not only verbally in the presence of three of my hon Friends at a meeting about Callendar Park, but subsequently in a letter of 28 February to the principal of that college:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, in the light of the information to be examined, we conclude that there is a case for some re-structuring our findings will be incorporated in a consultative document and we shall consult all concerned before any final decisions are reached."</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be more explicit than that statement. That promise has been broken by the Under-Secretary and he ought to be ashamed of himself if he had any share in the announcement of 6 August. Indeed, the colleges affected found out about it, in the first instance, only by reading of it in the press and hearing it on television.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to events in 1977. In January 1977, I issued a document containing some proposals for closures. In a subsequent statement in May 1977 I said that, after further consideration, Craiglockhart would be retained. In a final statement in December 1977 I said that, in the light of consultations, I had agreed that all the colleges could be retained. In contrast to what has happened on this occasion, I note that the present Secretary of State, in the Grand Committee debate about consultation on 15 February 1977 stated that he was grateful to me for emphasising that the document was a genuine consultative document. I wish that we could say the same of the document and the statement issued this year.<br><br>
In the light of that consultation, which was genuine consultation, I decided that all the colleges should be retained. The basic questions to be decided at that time were the same as they are now. A fact that was not easily accepted at first, either by Conservative or Labour Members, was that the system would have to be contracted because the numbers going into teaching were being reduced because of a reduction in the number of pupils in schools.<br><br>
Moreover, as the Secretary of State has confirmed this morning, there was no way of filling the colleges by taking on additional educational activities. The question in 1977 was whether to keep all the colleges going with reduced numbers or to take some colleges out of the system and keep the others going at a higher but still reduced level, leaving the closed colleges available for other purposes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
As I hope I made clear at the time, there was no ideal solution to the problem. There were advantages in concentration, and if I had not believed in them, I should not have made the proposals. I do not retract anything I said at that time, nor do I make any apology for what I proposed. It was a perfectly valid way of adjusting the system and concentrating it in a smaller number of colleges. I believed that there were economic and other advantages in doing so.<br><br>
However, there were also considerable disadvantages, because some of the smaller colleges perform an extremely useful regional function. In the consultative document I proposed that the system should be concentrated. But that consultation produced a unanimity of opinion against me, not only on this side of the Committee, but among all Conservative Members. They all argued against me. They said that all ten colleges should be kept, whatever the disadvantages and difficulties for some of the larger colleges.<br><br>
Those problems were all outlined explicitly, but I was told that we must keep all 10 colleges. The Secretary of State was one of the people prominent in that campaign. That campaign was waged not only in the House, but by every educational interest, including, incidentally, the principals of colleges that were not then under threat. They said that we must keep all the colleges even if it meant that there would be inconvenience and problems for the system. Therefore, everyone wished to keep all the colleges.<br><br>
Many extravagant statements were made by Conservative Members about my proposals. The hon Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor), who presumably is not an added Member to the Committee, said that it was a cold, savage, statistical exercise of butchery. That was a typical quotation from the hon Gentleman. The Secretary of State was equally scathing. Even the right hon Lady who is now Prime Minister, got a word in, When she was Leader of the Opposition, she said:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"It takes a long time to build up the reputation of a college… and where those colleges are doing a very good job, let's keep them in being."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there was a unanimous view at that time that the colleges should be kept going.<br><br>
It was on that basis that I made that decision and stated that, having made it, I would do everything possible to make the system work and, in particular, would find alternative uses for the surplus accommodation at the various colleges and adjust the intake to keep the smaller colleges viable. That is what I did and I thought that was the end of the matter. It should have remained the end of the matter. The campaign should not have been waged again. The integrity of Ministers and hon Members is not improved if they change their minds in the way that the Secretary of State did when he made a complete U-turn and abandoned, for no good reason, all he said in 1977, explained in his statement of 6 August and in his statement this morning. I accepted the decision, which was against my original views, and tried to make the system work. That should have been the end of it.<br><br>
If there had been an overwhelming change of circumstances since 1977—many unexpected things may have happened, many new factors could have come into the equation that we could not possibly have anticipated then—there may have been a case for looking at the matter again. Of course, that has not happened, despite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the attempts of the right hon Gentleman to pretend that something has changed since 1977. He quoted numbers, but all that has changed are the Secretary of State's own views on the matter and what it is convenient to do now.<br><br>
Of course the numbers have declined. I said that they would decline and everybody knew that they would decline. The decline has taken place in the way that was anticipated in 1977 and it has not been possible to fill all the colleges with additional work. The capacity in the colleges is under-used. It is no use the Secretary of State saying that this morning as if it was an unexpected development that was not anticipated in 1977. I said it would happen. All hon Gentlemen accepted that the decision we took would inevitably lead to that situation, but we all agreed that that was how we wanted the system to be adjusted. I adjusted the intakes to the various colleges, as I had said I would. If there had been a proportionate reduction all round in the intakes, colleges such as Craigie, Callendar Park and Craiglockhart would not have been viable at all, but we bumped up the intakes in the smaller colleges—or at least did not reduce them proportionately—so that those colleges could remain viable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman seems to be entirely ignoring the facts. He stated perfectly clearly in his consultative document that he visualised a system providing 11,900 places. Is he now stating that a system of 11,900 places can still be run? If so, what will he do with the surplus teachers who have no chance of ever getting a job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of having teachers trained for jobs that are not available. I made that point repeatedly in 1977, and was repeatedly criticised by Conservative Members in consequence. If one kept the 10 colleges, there would inevitably be a large amount of surplus accommodation in them. But, as the Secretary of State has acknowledged, I took considerable steps to reduce the number of places and to find alternative uses for the surplus accommodation. That has happened at Callendar Park, Craigie and all the other colleges, including the big ones. That was what I was asked to do, that was what I said I would do, and I carried out that pledge to the letter.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has not said this morning that, despite what I did, the smaller colleges are no longer viable or no longer doing a good job. He has gone out of his way to say what a splendid job they are all doing and how deplorable it is that he has nevertheless been forced to conclude that he must close them. If the small colleges, with their present small numbers of students, can do—in the Secretary of State's own words—a splendid job, it is unconvincing to say that, because of the breakdown of the system, the bigger colleges can not at present do an adequate job.<br><br>
Of course the situation is inconvenient for the big colleges, but all 10 principals came to meet me and said "Keep them all open. We in the bigger colleges will put up with the inconvenience." Some of those principals are strangely silent now. In 1977 they were all for unity and for defending the interests of the colleges under threat, but now a number of them seem to be looking after themselves and not thinking about what is happening in the rest of the system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
The chairman of the GTC at the time was the principal of Aberdeen College. He was very vocal. I have heard nothing on this controversy from him—or, for that matter, from the principal of Jordanhill. But I do not believe that we should alter the decision that was then made, and change the system simply because some of the bigger colleges find it rather inconvenient.<br><br>
The inconvenience was predictable. The colleges were going to manage to cope with it. I believe that they have coped with it. Nothing that the Secretary of State has said this morning has demonstrated to the Committee that the big colleges would find it impossible to cope with these reduced numbers. If the small colleges are viable and can cope, then the big colleges must be viable and able to cope too.<br><br>
Perhaps the important factor is the economics— the costs involved. Hon Gentlemen were very scathing about the 1977 proposals. The hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was particularly scathing. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State wishes to convince the Scots that some harsh reforms are necessary, the costings must be made and must be made public."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 15 March 1977; vol. 928, c. 361.]</p></blockquote>
Where are the costings for this exercise? When are they to be made public? This morning we have been given by the Secretary of State some apologies for figures. [<i>Interruption.</i>] We should be delighted if the hon Member for Edinburgh, West were to make a contribution to the debate this morning. I hope that he will be allowed to do so. [Hon Members: "Answer."]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we may be allowed to hear the right hon Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman asked the headmaster for permission to speak, but did not receive it.
Some costings have been produced that show that it will cost more to close the colleges than to keep them open. I do not know whether these figures are valid, but it is up to the Secretary of State to prove that they are not, by producing figures of his own. However, we can be sure that the savings to be made now must be considerably less than they were in 1977. The number of lecturers has already been reduced from 1,330 at that time to 1,050 now, alternative use has been found for some of the surplus college accommodation, so any savings—I doubt whether there are any—must be considerably less than in 1977. There are no economic grounds, and no new factors have emerged since 1977, to justify the right hon Gentleman's decision. The Secretary of State was careful not to mention the advice of the GTC because he has gone against its advice about Hamilton.<br><br>
I should like to speak briefly about the proposals, although my hon Friends will probably wish to put more detailed cases for the colleges which particularly effect their constituencies. I will first mention two colleges that are not down for closure. The first is Dundee, which is to be kept open although it has proved difficult to use surplus accommodation there and no solution has yet been found. I am delighted that Dundee is to be kept open, but I say to the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) and my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) that it is in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
worst position for surplus accommodation. Of course, Dundee, ought to be kept open, but the situation is slightly ironic.<br><br>
As for Dunfermline College—again the Government Whip is involved—I wish to put it on record, as it seems so little noticed, that that college is still subject to later reviews. Perhaps it will be closed subsequently.<br><br>
I now come to Craiglockhart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman tells us "No". He is the only person who has been consulted about anything. The Secretary of State's proposal concerning Craiglockhart is exactly as before, but the hon Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), who is the consistuency Member, was very hot about that college in 1977. He asked me what the difference was between a merger and a closure as they amount to the same thing. What is the difference between a merger and a closure in the Secretary of State's proposals? I do not know. I can only say that, after discussions, I made an arrangement with the hierarchy at that time that the intakes would be adjusted between Notre Dame and Craiglockhart to keep Craiglockhart viable. It provides for secondary as well as primary training. The adjustments were made and I understand that Craiglockhart is now working satisfactorily at that level. There is no justification, in view of the undertakings made in 1977, for disturbing the situation there.<br><br>
Successful efforts were made to provide alternative uses for Callendar Park, and its surplus accommodation has been considerably reduced. There are strong geographical reasons, including that of population trends, for keeping Callendar Park open and I accepted such reasons in 1977.<br><br>
The most extraordinary decision concerns Hamilton because, apart from the geography of the matter, there is a long history of educational deprivation in Lanarkshire which it has been exceedingly difficult to root out. In recent years we have just begun to do that, with a more adequate supply of teachers, but Lanarkshire still has immense educational problems on a scale not found even taking Glasgow as a whole. The situation is worse than in Glasgow and in other parts of Strathclyde.<br><br>
The Hamilton college was built as a permanent building but the Callendar Park and Craigie colleges were meant to be temporary buildings. Lanarkshire still has these problems. The General Teaching Council has said that it wants a contraction of the system and has bitterly criticised the Secretary of State for his decision on Hamilton.<br><br>
The Secretary of State made vague references to in-service training. The Under-Secretary had a meeting with the Hamilton college people recently and apparently put forward undefined proposals about in-service training there. A report on the meeting says:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Under-Secretary of State declared that it was his intention not to reduce the level of provision of in-service training in Lanarkshire".</p></blockquote>
The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"He did not know what he had in mind."</p></blockquote>
From what we know of the Under-Secretary, that sounds a pretty accurate note to me.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
If the Under-Secretary has something in mind, perhaps he will tell us at the end of our sitting. But whatever he has in mind—if he has something in mind—it would be far better if Hamilton college were kept open to provide pre-service training, too.<br><br>
There is a more interesting situation at Craigie. The Secretary of State has produced a wonderful geographical argument which conveniently manages to close Hamilton but to keep Craigie open. The Secretary of State did us the honour of not explaining that geographical pattern this morning. I think that he was frightened of what would happen if he tried to do so. But is it not convenient that we are able to close other colleges but, miraculously, Craigie, which is one of the smallest colleges, manages to stay open? That would not, of course, be because it happens to be in the Secretary of State's constituency.<br><br>
I would have respected the Secretary of State if he had put forward new proposals in August and said "I have changed my mind about what I said in 1977. I think that there has to be a contraction in the system that will involve closure of colleges. I made a mistake in 1977 and, having made that mistake, I shall close the smaller colleges. I am sorry that that will mean closing Craigie in my constituency."<br><br>
That would have been a courageous decision. But the Secretary of State has made a cowardly and cynical decision which involves closing colleges in other parts of Scotland but which will keep open Craigie college in his constituency. That decision demonstrates the shallow, cynical way in which the Secretary of State has approached the matter.<br><br>
The decisions were made in 1977. They have conscientiously been carried out since then; the system has been adjusted. No new factors have arisen since 1977 to justify the reversal of the decisions that were taken after the most careful consultation with all the interests concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, but the right hon Gentleman cannot get away with ignoring the whole main issue. What has he got to say about the fall in numbers since 1977 from 11,900 to 8,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Craigie?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman has simply refused to face up to that situation. He cannot get away with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has not listened. The arguments are exactly the same as they were in 1977. We are waiting for some justification from the Secretary of State for the betrayal of everything that he and Conservative Members said in 1977. We have not had that justification from the Secretary of State and I do not imagine that we shall have it from the Under-Secretary in his winding-up speech. Nothing has changed to justify the reversal of the decisions taken in 1977. Unnecessary decisions have been taken with a cynical disregard for the needs of education in Scotland. That is why we condemn them.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is now little more than an hour and a half for the winding-up speeches and the rest of the debate. I am only pointing out the obvious; if we have speeches of desirable brevity, more hon Members will be able to participate in the debate and possibly the debate will be better because of it.</span></p>
<p>11.24 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a little embarrassing to make a speech in which one seems to be criticising, or at least differing from, one's own Front Bench, especially when that is led by someone as agreeable as my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), for whom I have a high personal regard. Nevertheless, I am perturbed by the tendency which seems to be developing of saying one thing one moment and doing something different the next.<br><br>
I shall give three examples. At the last election we said that there would be less legislation. Yet we have just finished a Session with a heavier load than any that I can remember. Another undertaking was to bring a lot of Civil Service defence jobs to Glasgow. We were hardly in office when the number was slashed dramatically. Even in my own consitiuency, I asked my hon Friend the Member for Pentlands, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, whether he would hold a public inquiry into the Crow Road motorway scheme. He said that it could not be done, that he did not have the power. Yet, two months later, he held an inquiry, although he had categorically denied on the Floor of the House the possibility of doing so.<br><br>
Backing and filling like that, saying one thing one moment and doing the opposite the next, is not good for democracy. The public should be able to rely on what we say and, when we express a point of view, to have confidence that we shall stick to it. Yet I am sorry to say that the line taken by my right hon Friend today, and in his August statement, is completely different from what he was arguing three years ago in this Committee. Apart from the fact that he wants to retain Craigie, while his predecessor, the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) wanted to retain Hamilton, there is not much to choose between the two speeches. Though this morning the voice was the voice of Younger, the words, or the theme behind the words, were undoubtedly those of Millan.<br><br>
Not that the right hon Gentleman sticks any better than my right hon Friend to what he said then. He is also guilty of an about-turn. The right hon Member for Craigton was sitting on these Benches: he was a centraliser, a slasher of the periphery. Now, having moved to the other side of the Committee, he is all for decentralisation and is a preserver—if you please, from a Socialist—of the status quo.<br><br>
Is it the case that our views cannot be relied upon and that they swing backwards and forwards, depending on whether we are on one side of the Committee or the other? With regard to teacher training colleges, sadly that seems to be the position.<br><br>
I well remember our debate on the future of the colleges three years ago and the impassioned speech of my right hon Friend. He moved even me. He was referring to what he described as the bond forged between the colleges, the schools, the teachers. At that point I interjected "And the community". My right hon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Friend repeated those three words "And the community" and incorporated them into his speech. Thus he showed that he was a supporter not only of Craigie, but of the whole principle of decentralised colleges because of the benefit they brought to the community.<br><br>
No one was disputing then, or is disputing now, that with a falling birth rate, there must be fewer teachers. But is the training of these teachers to be concentrated in a few large colleges or dispersed into a greater number of small colleges? That was the question then and, as the right hon Member for Craigton said, it is still the question today.<br><br>
Three years ago my right hon Friend was for more small colleges; now he is for fewer large colleges. What is the reason for the change? Will fewer centralised colleges really mean a substantial saving? I doubt it. My hon Friend the Under-Secretary, in writing to me, went out of his way to declaim finance as the overriding consideration. He said that he was after what was best educationally. But what is best educationally? I suppose that it is possible that a large college may reach a higher standard of pre-service training, but such colleges, because of their size, will have a vast hinterland from which they receive their students.<br><br>
In-service training, particularly in depressed areas as those around Hamilton, is bound to suffer. Yet it is in precisely those sort of areas that the existence of a college can bring an enhanced cultural dividend to the whole community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon Gentleman has the same name as me, but I should prefer not to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) knows that he must not remain on his feet if the hon Gentleman does not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One Tam on his feet is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member for West Lothian must know that when the Chairman is on his feet, no hon Member may be standing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the enhanced cultural dividend for the whole community. My right hon Friend recognised that vital fact when he concurred with my intervention in his speech three years ago.<br><br>
It will make no difference to the quality of the cultural life of Glasgow whether the size of Jordanhill is increased or decreased. Nor will Edinburgh be affected by what happens to Moray House. But with Hamilton, Callendar Park and Craigie, it is another matter.<br><br>
On the financial aspect, as my hon Friend the Under-Secretary told me, nothing is clear cut. That also came out in my right hon Friend's speech this morning. On the educational aspect, the views are fairly evenly balanced between centralisation and decentralisation. But on the community aspect, there can be no argument. The deprived areas need these colleges.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
When there is so little to choose financially and educationally, I urge my right hon Friend to listen to the cry for help that comes not only from the threatened colleges but from the communities to which they have brought new hope and a richer life.<br><br>
In reprieving Craigie, my right hon Friend has shown himself sympathetic to the needs of the periphery. But to do that for Craigie alone is neither logical nor consistent. If Craigie is to remain, so should the other colleges. If they are to be swept away, Craigie must go too. But I am sure that my right hon Friend will never agree to that because he is aware, as the local Member, of the community advantage of a training college.<br><br>
In fairness to the other communities about to be deprived of this advantage, and in the interests of consistency with the whole tenor of his 1977 speech, let not my right hon Friend stop at Craigie. Let him extend the mantle of his generosity to the other colleges and protect them too.<br><br>
My right hon Friend will remember that Mary Tudor was said to have died with "Calais" engraved upon her heart. I urge him to have the courage to change his mind, lest he find that Hamilton and Callendar Park are engraved on his.</span></p>
<p>11.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill<span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following such a remarkable speech it is clear that the present breed of Tory Ministers in the Scottish Office differs from that in days gone by. Their policies have the merit of consistency. Those of us who came in at the last election thought that the question of the colleges was finished. When some of us went to a meeting with the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) in St Andrew's House, we understood that those engaged in education would be able to play a direct part in future changes in the college system. Unfortunately, as in so many cases with the Scottish Office—as was indicated by the hon Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) this view was reversed and the whole matter fudged and squeezed through at the end of last Session in a most despicable manner.<br><br>
Those of us involved in education tend to consider educational philosophy which was so admirably mapped out by the hon Member for Hillhead. I do not propose to go into that. In the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs I was one of those who suggested that this morning's meeting might well generate more heat than light, and that it might be advisable for the Select Committee to look into the financial implications. In that dispassionate atmosphere we might have been able to obtain some of the figures which the Secretary of State is neither capable nor willing to provide for our consideration today to show justification on financial grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart<span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourley. Is it in order for the hon Gentleman to reveal the private discussions of the Select Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be in order, but I did not think that the hon Gentleman was doing so. He merely indicated what it might be opportune for the Select Committee to do.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was simply seeking to make clear the private views of some members of the Select Committee. I do not think that that is a breach of confidence.<br><br>
In short, sharp debate it is not possible to cover the many complicated issues. It is therefore incumbent on the Government to provide as much information as possible. Neither financial nor educational information has been provided this morning. One is therefore forced to the conclusion that there are neither financial nor educational reasons for the closures. The only consistent body throughout the late 1970s was the Scottish Education Department. It wished to close colleges and have the slimmer and more compact system to which the Secretary of State referred. If there is to be a more compact system, there is no reason to have a college in Aberdeen. There is no reason for having a college in Dundee, which—as my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) pointed out—is having considerable difficulty in arranging accommodation.<br><br>
There is little case, as we have said already, for Craigie, if Callander Park and Hamilton were to go. If Craiglockhart is to be merged there is little point in retaining it. A situation could be reached in which only three buildings were left.<br><br>
Dunfermline college at Cramond, of all the institutions, could probably most easily be flogged on economic grounds, to any country club owner—or even the Army, which was interested in it last time. This could be carried through. It would be sensible and straightforward. There would be 8,000 places. It could be run on a tight basis. There would probably be full halls of residence. The case could be argued tidily, but the cowardice which has characterised the actions of the Front Bench since this matter arose earlier this year makes it evident that such logic will not be accepted.<br><br>
At the next review in two or three years, another college will close, and if the right hon Member for Ayr (Mr. Yonger) is no longer the Secretary of State for Scotland, I imagine that Craigie would be the first victim.<br><br>
Conservative Members who are sitting quietly keeping their heads down because they have nothing to fear will be the next in line. They will be doing the special pleading. The cynicism of Conservative Members has been an education to some of us. They are not prepared to fight for the Scottish education system or for education or even economic grants.<br><br>
The Scottish Office has caved in to the demands of the SED for a tidy administrative machine which it can control, but which will not serve the needs of the education system because at no time have educationists been seriously consulted.<br><br>
The quicker that the Scottish Office team resigns, the better. That is the only honourable thing that it can do following the campaigns of 1977. Others should be allowed to deal with the matter in a humane, sensible and more realistic way.</span></p>
<p>11.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart<span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened, as always, with interest to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). I hope that he will excuse me if I do not follow his general point. My purpose is limited and single: to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
express to the Committee and to the Government the concern, anxiety, and opposition of a large number of my constituents to the proposal to close Hamilton college. That criticism has also been expressed publicly by such bodies as the Conservative group in the Strathclyde region and North Lanarkshire Conservative district councillors.<br><br>
I support entirely the Government's general case for rationalisation of the system, and I agree that the decisions are difficult. Everybody must recognise that. However, there remains a widespread concern on a number of points. The first is the nature of the Hamilton college. It cannot be said too often that the decision to set up that college was taken by a Conservative Government because of the educational needs of the area. Unlike other colleges, Hamilton, as the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) said, was never envisaged to meet a temporary education boom. Without Hamilton, the area would be the most populated region in Britain without a college of Education.<br><br>
Figures can be quoted endlessly, but it is interesting to note that Hamilton college has more primary schools within a 10 mile radius than any other non-denominational college of education in Scotland, and that there are more secondary schools within 10 miles of Hamilton than of any other college except Jordanhill. Hamilton has been flexible and has made a major contribution in the stortage subjects.<br><br>
Secondly, there is concern about costs. I do not know whether Ministers have discussed the subject with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, but I suspect that he would say, "It is absolutely the key to the Government's economic strategy that the public sector borrowing requirement should be reduced over the next two or three years".<br><br>
Therefore the key question on costs is what will be the net effect on the PSBR over the next two or three critical years. If the answer is that the PSBR would be increased, the Chief Secretary would say "But we have cash limits". Therefore, if the decision to close Hamilton and the other colleges increases net public expenditure, there must be off-setting economies elsewhere in the Scottish education system. If that is to happen, I hope that my right hon Friend will spell out precisely where those economies will be made.<br><br>
There is also the question of regional distribution. The only argument against Hamilton appears to be that it is 20 miles from Glasgow. But it has always been 20 miles from Glasgow. It was 20 miles from Glasgow when it was set up. The argument is that other colleges need to be kept open because of the concept of regional distribution. I hope that the concept of regional distribution is a bit more sophisticated than a quick look at an AA road map. Lanarkshire has three times the population of, for example, the south-west of Scotland. It might be more sensible to look at the total journeys involved. I suspect that the figures might prove interesting.<br><br>
We talk about Hamilton being in Lanarkshire, and about Craigie, for example, covering the whole of the south-west of Scotland. According to my sophisticated analytical tool of regional distribution—my AA road map—it is quicker to travel from Dumfries to Hamilton than from Dumfries to Ayr. Questions arise on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
whole concept of regional distribution.<br><br>
We were elected on a platform of freedom of choice. We have extended, and are extending, freedom of choice in many areas—except to anyone who wishes to study to be a teacher in west-central Scotland. I know the secretary of a Young Conservative group in the west end of Glasgow who is studying at Hamilton college because she exercised her choice to do so. Everywhere else in Britain there is a choice. In Cardiff, Durham, and Newcastle, choice has been maintained.<br><br>
My hon Friend said that he is maintaining the in-service provision in terms of quantity and quality, and that is 43 per cent, of the work at Hamilton, He is maintaining the joint technical education course with Bell college and Motherwell technical college. But the test, the pre-service, is being cut. There have been statements that something might be left in the colleges to be closed. I hope that my hon Friend will spell out the position more precisely than has been done so far.<br><br>
Is there any constructive alternative to closing Hamilton college? In my discussions with those at the college, I have been impressed by the flexibility that they have shown in facing up to the problem and their readiness to consider solutions. Hamilton already provides facilities for Bell college, which is bursting at the seams.<br><br>
I may not be popular with some hon Members if I ask them to look to England, but we can see that the problem there has been met by mergers of different institutions into colleges of higher education and polytechnics.<br><br>
The decision to close Hamilton college has touched a raw nerve in the body politic of the west of Scotland. Many who are sympathetic to the Government— Conservatives or independents—believe that a number of questions still need answers.</span></p>
<p>11.48 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be called, and to be called after the hon Members for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) and Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). They covered ground that I had intended to cover, and they underlined the serious reservations among all sections of the community in Scotland about the Government's decision.<br><br>
I wish to concentrate on the college in my constituency—Hamilton college of education, one of the three threatened colleges. Our debate is—of necessity— brief and, inevitably, fewer hon Members can be called than would have wished to speak. I know that what I say about Hamilton college of education is a view shared by all those hon Members representing Lanarkshire constituencies and many people outside the House.<br><br>
The record of Hamilton college is considerable, and note of that has been taken by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) and the hon Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). It has instilled a feeling of considerable pride in the community of Lanarkshire and such a contribution, which the Secretary of State made so much of in 1977, cannot be lightly disregarded.<br><br>
The college has a fine record in reversing the chronic teacher shortage that was almost endemic to Lanarkshire before 1966 and in creating a college of education in Hamilton itself. Its contribution to solving the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
problems of educational deprivation in that area—an issue that considerably concerned those Conservative Members who spoke on the issue in the House in 1977— is beyond question.<br><br>
Local feeling is of such proportions that the Government find themselves almost completely without friends. A petition that was circulated in the four months since the announcement on 6 August was presented to the Secretary of State for Scotland two weeks ago. It contained 106,000 signatures. Not one voice was raised in support of the Secretary of State's proposals. He has yet to find support even from his own side in the House. The only individual who came to his support publicly in the Scottish press is the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). We may hear his chorus of support here again today. There has been no support for the Secretary of State's views among the dozens of submissions made to him. Last week, as the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East said, Strathclyde region's Conservative group came out strongly and critically on the side of Hamilton college and against the Government's policy.<br><br>
Clearly, the education arguments are paramount in this case. They were what mattered to the Conservative Party in 1977 and they are no less important now. No good educational arguments have been advanced for the closure of Hamilton college of education. The position, although radically different and much better in 1980 than it was in 1966 when the college was formed, still does not give room for complacency.<br><br>
The Lanarkshire division of Strathclyde still has the worst staffing levels of any education division in Scotland, and the much-lauded parent-teacher ratios that the Secretary of State spoke of in his opening speech are worse in the Lanarkshire division than in any other part of the Scottish record on which the Secretary of State expounded with such pride.<br><br>
Lanarkshire also has the highest population under the age of 14 and the second highest birth rate in Scotland. So the progress that has been made since 1966 and the inception of the college is not something that we can regard with complacency. The problems do not disappear overnight.<br><br>
In addition to the normal difficulties of educational deprivation, there are serious difficulties for the future of industrial Scotland of the shortage subjects in secondary schools—especially in Lanarkshire. That is still a problem, and despite the efforts of the Strathclyde region in going as far as America to try to sort out the problem in the key economic areas of maths, science and technical subjects, the position in Lanarkshire in these subjects is worse than anywhere else in Scotland.<br><br>
Despite that, the contribution of the college has been significant in this respect. In six years the college has produced for Lanarkshire 80 teachers and 103 science teachers, and even this year there are 15 maths teachers and 30 science teachers being trained in the college. The technical subjects course that is allegedly to be protected by the Government—there has been no indication of how this is to be done in the absence of a college of education in Hamilton—is likely to produce 15 to 20 technical teachers per annum. Where else are these teachers going to be produced?<br><br>
The fundamental point highlighted by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East is that being 20 miles
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
from Glasgow on an AA route map is not a reason for saying that people are now mobile and can travel the 20 miles to Glasgow or 25 miles to the only other West of Scotland college of education.<br><br>
The history of Lanarkshire shows clearly that unless people are trained in Lanarkshire they will not stay in Lanarkshire. There is no evidence that the Government or any educationalist can put forward, which suggests that the number of teachers required in Lanarkshire in the future can and will be recruited if teacher training is concentrated in the city of Glasgow.<br><br>
We come to the fraught subject of costings. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East is even more of a protector of the public sector borrowing requirement than I seek to be. The Government have had four months since they made their ill-considered decision on 6 August to come forward with the costings that they must have produced in order to persuade themselves that they need to close three colleges of education. Yet we have heard nothing this morning to suggest that there is any knowledge, evidence or even any parameters of cost to suggest that the Government will make any substantial savings. The Secretary of State said that costs would be saved, because a quarter of the staff presently employed in the colleges would not be needed and that most of the non-academic staff would not be needed if the colleges were shut.<br><br>
However, there are a substantial number of halls of residence in Hamilton college of education of which only a minority are used by the students. Clearly, the closing of halls of residence would hit higher education throughout the west of Scotland. Therefore, the non-academic staff are not linked with the decision taken on the basis of future school rolls, but are taken in the context of the future provision of accommodation for students and colleges other than Hamilton. Why have we not heard about that?<br><br>
We come to the remarkable off-the-cuff statement made by the Secretary of State about provision for in-service training. If I quote him correctly he said that in future the Govenment would try to maintain an in-service base in some of the areas concerned. However, as he, and Members of the Committee know, almost 40 per cent, of the work of the Hamilton college is concerned with in-service primary school training in Lanarkshire. If the Secretary of State intends to keep 40 per cent, of the capacity of Hamilton college what is the argument for closing the college? Surely, after all the time taken on the proposal by the Government since 6 August, we should expect more than one throwaway line in the speech of the Secretary of State on an issue of such importance to the future of this college of education. I do not believe that it makes any sense for the Secretary of State to make a throwaway remark and suggest that in-service training has to be maintained without the infrastructure of a college that exists and has made such a contribution to the educational standards of Lanarkshire.<br><br>
The educational reason for keeping Hamilton college of education is unanswerable. The costs of closing it, both social and financial, make absolutely no sense. It would be an outrageous waste of all that has been built up over the years if the Secretary of State were to pursue the perverse intention which will, certainly in our future, not be forgiven by the people of

Lanarkshire. Therefore, I urge the Secretary of State to change his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate is making good progress so far, and I hope that the momentum will be maintained.</span></p>
<p>11.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacKay<span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to follow the hon Member for Hamilton, (Mr. Robertson) who I expect would have put up a splendid defence of Hamilton college as he was educated in Argyll. However, I point out to him what Lord Ross of Marnock as he now is said in the 1977 debate:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is all very well to make special pleading, but if every bit of special pleading is successful that means no change."—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 17 February 1977; c. 83.]</p></blockquote>
In the light of the statistics before us I do not think that no change is a reasonable option. In the early 1970s there were 12,500 student teachers in the Scottish colleges. In 1980-81 there will be 4,700—about one-third of the figure in the early 1970s.<br><br>
I do not think that the status quo is a proper option. Indeed, I read through the 1977 debate, as I imagined that it was prescribed reading for this morning's effort, and about the wisest thing I saw was the beginning of the speech made by Mr. Richard Buchanan, who was then the hon Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If anyone else were sitting in the same seats as my right hon and hon Friends they probably would be undergoing the same exercise. The statistics are irrefutable."—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 17 February 1977;<i>c.</i> 83.]</p></blockquote>
I am not prepared to defend the stance that the Government took when they were in Opposition in 1977. The case made by the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) was as valid then as is the same case made today by my right hon Friend the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The pattern is that we have places for 11,000 student teachers and we are using 5,500, which will decline to 4,500 in, I think, 1984-85. What do we do? One of the options is that we could fill the vacancies and ignore the fact that there would be no jobs for the teachers when they finish training.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is right—no one is suggesting that. We have 1,000 primary teachers out of work, and I am asking—if the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will allow me—whether if we cannot use these spare places it is right that they should continue to exist. The second option, which appears to be the one being argued by the Opposition, is that we should carry on with the present under-capacity, ignore the fact that we have under-use of the college lecturers, and happily go on. But that is not an option because it is a waste of valuable resources.<br><br>
Do we come to further slimming, which was the policy advocated by my now silent hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). He thought that the correct option in 1977— some hon Members still think it today—was to slim the system by cutting over all the colleges. That was the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
policy eventually taken up by the right hon Member for Craigton, which brought the levels down to, I think, 11,000 and meant a considerable reduction in staff. That was a difficult exercise and it was equally difficult to find alternative uses for the spare accommodation.<br><br>
Dundee has been mentioned as the classic example of a place where it is proving impossible to find a use for its amazing amount of spare accommodation in Banff college. It seems that some of the figures which made slimming an option in 1977 were too optimistic and were not borne out by the facts.<br><br>
The hon Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) suggested that in 1980-81 there would be an intake to the college system of primary teacher students of 1,190. The intake this year is 690, so even the basis on which the general slimming programme was advocated in 1977 has been eroded by the passage of time and the new figures.<br><br>
It appears to me that more slimming is not an option, because it would take many of the colleges down to levels verging on the farcical. Certainly it would not be a viable option, because below a certain level there has to be a doubling up of staff duties, and staff have to do two or three jobs, one of which may not be the principal job that interests them or in which they are trained. That is a serious problem. A general slimming would create redundancies. Just as many people write to us complaining of the redundancies that will result from my right hon Friend's system, so, if we have a general slimming, there will also be redundancies. There is no way round that, and the right hon Member for Craigton acknowledged in 1977 that slimming would create redundancies, as would closures.<br><br>
Incidentally, I am amazed to find that the college-trained people who should be the cream of the teaching profession cannot move into schools where their expertise would be welcomed. They could take part in the work of the school at the chalk face, but their redundancy scheme does not entitle them to continue to be eligible for redundancy pay if they make that move. They are not considered, and do not consider themselves, to be part of the day school system of education. As a past day school teacher, I find that strange and a little insulting. Those people, who should be the best in the profession, could find a meaningful role in the day schools, especially in relation to those subjects where there is a shortage of teachers.<br><br>
If we slim further, some colleges will get fewer and fewer students. Some people argue about the matter of choice. That was mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart). Why do we not allow students to go to the colleges of their choice? I tell my hon Friend that a choice exists at present because my right hon Friend has to announce allocations to every college to maintain reasonable intakes. If he were to allocate more students to, say, Hamilton, another college would receive fewer.<br><br>
I know—I took it from my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith)—that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) suggested that we might take a large axe to Jordanhill college. That might be an idea: I do not know. However, it must be remembered that the bulk of the students there are engaged in Secondary training. But even Jordanhill college's intake is small.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has misunderstood my remarks. I ask him not to talk about slimming, which is not being suggested. Will he deal with our proposal that colleges should deversify and that educational resources should be used as part of an integrated higher and further education system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But even if we do that, we shall still be putting too few students into many of the colleges because the college of education portion will remain very small. Callendar Park has under 200 students at present, while Hamilton has under 300. I believe that no option exists. I also believe that no option existed for the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). It is a pity that the decision was not made then. I would go further: both right hon Members in their respective times got the matter about right. Had both done what they said they wished to do, we might have been in a better situation today.<br><br>
I am impressed by the pleading about the special work of the colleges. However, let us be honest. Any colleges that were closed by my right hon Friend could equally plead on behalf of their splendid work. I hope that that is true, and I am a little surprised that their representatives come here thinking that we should be amazed that they carry out such excellent work. I am not at all amazed because I expect that of them.<br><br>
However, it is important—I shall try to wind up on this—that my right hon and hon Friends should consider some of the special activities of the colleges that are to be closed—for example, the technical course offered by Hamilton college. I urge them to find a way to maintain that.<br><br>
In-service training is not the primary role of a teacher-training college. The primary role is to train student teachers. Advisers are appointed by all education authorities and I suppose that part of their remit concerns in-service training. If the colleges were full of pre-student teachers not nearly as much in-service training would take place. I do not think that there can be any argument about that. In-service training is a proper way for pre-student teachers to fill in time and make good use of the staff and talents that they have. But more in-service training is being carried out in schools.<br><br>
Therefore, I suggest that my right hon Friend considers whether those lecturers who will not be able to find jobs elsewhere in the student teacher-training system should be put on secondment to local authorities to continue their in-service work. That has happened in the Lanarkshire division. The in-service work could be based—a base would have to be given— on, say, Jordanhill College. Lecturers could then continue their in-service work in schools in Lanarkshire, which is what they say they do.<br><br>
It is not an easy decision, and is made doubly difficult because those involved are a literate group, who seem to write more letters on the issue than anybody else does on any other matter. Indeed, I have a small suspicion that the source of most of the paperwork in schools is the teachers' training colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot get away from the fact that there are only 5,500 student teachers—reducing to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
4,500—for 11,000 places. As the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) said, the longer we put off the inevitably disagreeable decisions which need to be made to deal with the changed circumstances the worse it will be for all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One advantage of the election of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) was that it must have improved the staffing arrangements at Oban high school. It seems to me from his remarks that he is an educational Philistine, who is not prepared to agree to any improvement whatever in the standard of education in Scotland.<br><br>
This debate is almost like a football game—a return match, so to speak—in which there seem to be more own goals than conventional scoring. The full circle has been turned. However, I was pleased to note that some Conservative Members took exception to what the Government were doing. I hope that if there is a vote they will put their views to the test.<br><br>
One reason why the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) changed his views previously was the tremendous pressure that was exerted on him from all sections of the community. I hope that such pressure will now at least cause the Secretary of State to consider changing the arrangements that he has suggested for the colleges.<br><br>
I do not want to discuss the matter of geography and community. Those points have been adequately expressed. But if geography is not taken into account there will be problems in the staffing of schools. I am thinking particularly of Hamilton and the staffing of Lanarkshire schools, about which there should be general agreement. I should like to speak about cost later, largely because we have almost no information to go on in relation to that matter.<br><br>
However, I wish to consider what the colleges might be used for. Colleges of education are assets, built up with tremendously skilled staff. It is necessary, instead of just slashing and cutting—as the Scottish education department seems to do regardless of who is in power at the Scottish Office—to examine ways in which we can use colleges to improve education. That should be our target.<br><br>
Questions of staffing and places at the colleges are, to my mind, secondary to the whole issue of the improvement in the quality of education. There are certain ways in which that can be achieved.<br><br>
I should like to mention first the subject of in-service training. In a parliamentary answer last month the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland made it clear to the right hon Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) that he believed the primary function of the colleges was to provide pre-service training, although in 1977 he argued in Committee that the then Labour policy lacked educational content because no reference was made to in-service training.<br><br>
It is politically dishonest that such arguments have been dropped, in the interest either of financial economy —which cannot be proved—or of some form of proof to the Treasury that the Scottish Office is prepared to make sacrifices, however bizarre they might be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes<span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A virility symbol.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be a virility symbol, but it is a castration of Scotland's education system.<br><br>
The declining primary school population of the past two years will soon be reaching the secondary schools. That provides an opportunity to reverse the trend of the past decade. Almost half of Scotland's pupils have approached the end of their school careers with little or no hope of reaching SCE standard.<br><br>
I am not arguing that the sole criterion of educational value is examination passes. That would be a totally wrong assessment of the system. But there is cause for concern about the psychological damage that is done to young people when they feel that they are failures. It was illustrated in a survey of attitudes that was published last week by the Centre for Educational Sociology of Edinburgh under the title "Tell Them From Me". Some youngsters saw themselves as being treated as though they were thick, as dunces, flung aside under the system. 1 do not believe that is an advertisement for any education system. Far from being proud of our educational set-up—as we have been in Scotland for years—I think that we should admit to its deficiencies.<br><br>
To overcome this feeling of rejection and resentment there must surely be curricular development and changes within our schools. This can be achieved only if teachers—who often suffer from the school-to-college-and-university syndrome—are encouraged to develop their abilities and commitments through in-service courses, which could perhaps include arrangements for teachers to get work experience and sabbaticals, and so on. In that way they will understand more fully the world into which the youngsters will go after school. I believe that the cycle of deprivation can be broken only if the teaching profession is allowed to develop its potential.<br><br>
I should prefer the Government to regard the colleges as a source of development, rather than the proposals that they have produced to transfer bright pupils from the State schools and into the private sector under the assisted places scheme. Greater use would be made of the colleges of education if there were adequate facilities for in-service training. One problem at present is that schools are held back by local authority staffing requirements and it is sometimes impossible for teachers to get away for courses. That could leave their departments understaffed and result in children being unable to follow courses in certain subjects. I am thinking particularly of physics.<br><br>
The second matter that I wish to raise concerns the need for more link courses to attract specialist teachers in shortage subjects. I will not dwell on this, as the hon Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) dealt with the subject in some depth. Undoubtedly Hamilton college must be commended for its performance, particularly in producing teachers in shortage subjects. I know from my experience in Strathclyde that there are problems over school staffing and certain subjects. In my area of Dundee the supply of physics teachers is a problem. If a college is producing the goods, the Secretary of State should take great care not to do anything that might cut off the supply of teachers of shortage subjects. Teachers will not necessarily travel, and even if they do, they might not return to the area which had nurtured them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
The third subject that I wish to speak about— again briefly—is graduate teachers. It is a target at which successive Governments have aimed. There have been no discussions about how the problem should be tackled. The degree course is overdue. If the Government accepted that, Britain would again lead the field of teacher training, rather than slipping down the league table of European nations.<br><br>
My plea is that the Government should use existing resources and not cut back training resources purely to save money, because if they do that, the Government have failed completely in respect of their costings. The previous Administration was criticised by them three years ago for failing to give any figures. The Government must produce their figures if they are using financial criteria as the reason for cutting down the number of colleges. If they do not have them, they ought not to put forward these proposals. If they have the figures, why on earth have they not produced them so that they can be examined? If they proved to be correct, the task would be easier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon Gentleman agree that an important criterion which the Government have put forward is their emphasis on the regional centres of teacher training colleges?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They may put an emphasis on that but it is not sufficient. My argument is that, rather than examining cutting back the number of colleges, we should consider how existing facilities can be better used, if not completely at least more than at present to improve educational facilities. That should be the standard, rather than a narrow financial one. Even if it were proved—it has not occurred because the figures were not given to us about the savings—the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) was correct to hack his own Government in the shins for their incompetence in not having the figures available.<br><br>
How can we take a decision of such importance without any figures being tabled to justify the claim that there are financial savings? Frankly, if the figures cannot be produced I do not believe the claim and I think that the present Government are as wrong as their predecessors were three years ago.</span></p>
<p>12.20</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible. The Government must be grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for calling the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), because he is the only Conservative Member who has supported the proposals—sorry, decisions. There is to be no consultation. My hon Friends have referred to statements made by Conservative Members last time round, but I think that I can go one better than that. It is unusual to see a Conservative Member on a picket line demonstration. It is part of the Labour Party tradition to take part in such demonstrations, but it is not part of the Conservative tradition. However, last time round, on a demonstration outside New St. Andrews House I stood shoulder to shoulder with the present Secretary of State for Scotland. Nothing has changed. He was right then and he is wrong now.<br><br>
Believe it or not the Conservatives were criticising my right hon Friend the then Secretary of State for lack of consultation. That was one of the arguments—there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
was not enough time, too few bodies would be given time to put in their submissions. On this occasion the Government have not been prepared to consult at all.<br><br>
The second criticism was that my right hon Friend would not produce any savings, but neither have the present Government. Following questions from my hon Friends the Members for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) who had been given no answer on the matter, I put down a specific question about costings, which I thought might be answered, asking the Secretary of State what the cost would be if he closed the colleges in 1981, 1982,1983 or 1984 and if 90 per cent., 80 per cent., 70 per cent., 60 per cent., or 50 per cent, of the staff were declared redundant. I gave him the opportunity to be specific but I was told that selective estimates could not be provided without "undue expenditure" of time and resources. It is absolutely disgraceful that when people's jobs and careers are at risk the Scottish Education Department cannot spend a little time and money finding out the figures.<br><br>
I want to ask the Minister some specific questions. Is he legally right in saying that students can be moved to other colleges? There is a doubt about whether he can carry that out. Has he really costed out whether he will maintain the in-service provision? That requires technical and secretarial staff to run off materials, as well as print and liabrary facilities. It is unjustifiable that the Government cannot provide the figures.<br><br>
What about the cost of the Craiglockhart merger? ALCES have given £2,500,000 as a conservative estimate of the cost. A current document puts the figure considerably higher because of the proposal to abandon the two colleges and create a new one. That would mean redundancy payments for every member of staff in both colleges. I hope that the Minister will answer those specific questions and will give us some idea of the actual cost. He has said that the total cost of running the three colleges for a year is £3¾ million, but the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) was right to say that it is the cost over the next two or three years that matters. At a conservative estimate, £5½ million will be spent on capital costs in the first year. The Secretary of State said that not all the £3¾ million would be saved. What savings will there be over the next two or three years? The answer is "None".<br><br>
I should like to pose one last question. What figures do the Government have for projected wastage in the teaching profession—as opposed to what has been happening so far? We are reaching the bulge point when those who entered the teaching profession after the Second World War are reaching retirement age and are likely to disappear from the system in the next two or three years. The Minister should give us some indication of those figures.<br><br>
The Ministers must think again. If they were to regard the paper as a consultative document we could have genuine consultation about the options. But if the Secretary of State insists on making decisions, we shall continue to fight him on them by every means possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Ewing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan<span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. As some of us have been trying to catch your eye since 10.30, and as the debate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
is so important in relation to the future of Scottish education, would it be possible to extend the sitting so that those of us who have been trying to catch your eye will have a chance to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the Chairman's discretion does not really apply in this Committee, and, in any case, some hon Members would still be disappointed.</span></p>
<p>12.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing<span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting and emotional, and, except for the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) who is the Government's statutory defender in Scotland, not a single hon Member has spoken in support of the proposals that we have been considering. Perhaps the most scathing indictment of the Secretary of State and his hon Friend came from the hon Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) who described in a courageous speech the sense of betrayal that is felt because of the way in which Ministers have treated the colleges of education, the students and staff and the areas served by the colleges.<br><br>
I regret having to say this, Mr. Gourlay, but nevertheless I shall do so. After the Hampden Park fiasco and the treatment of the colleges of education, no one in Scotland believes a single word that the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary says. I could spend the whole of my speech quoting from what was said by the four guilty men who now occupy the Government Front Bench—I exclude the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) who never says anything about anything and therefore never gets into trouble—and by the Solicitor-General for Scotland who has taken the wise course and disappeared to Fielden House to escape the criticism that would be levelled at him as well, but I know in my heart of hearts that it would not help to salve the consciences of the Ministers involved in this betrayal.<br><br>
The Government must know the views of their own supporters. The hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), the hon Member for Hillhead, Conservative councillors, Conservative voters—although I admit that I cannot call in aid any large numbers from that quarter—and Conservative supporters throughout Scotland are strong in their condemnation of the way in which the Secretary of State has acted. It is significant that when the right hon Gentleman opened the debate he did not submit the name of a single person or organisation who supported the proposals.<br><br>
In his attack on college lecturers the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) was a bit below his usual standards—and they are not very high at the best of times. He said that my right hon Friend used this slimming process in 1977. My right hon Friend openly admitted when opening the debate that his proposals had been thought out and were put to the Committee. In 1977, the eventual outcome, the solution that was applied, was imposed on my right hon Friend by the will of the Committee. The reason I bring out that matter is that I hope the present Secretary of State has the same decency, standing, humility, and integrity as was shown by my right hon Friend in 1977 when the roles were reversed and that when the will of the Committee is made known he will take the same cognisance of it. The will is already known—there has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
been only one speech in support of the Government's policy.<br><br>
I pass to the question of the college in my constituency in Falkirk—the Callendar Park college. When I went to that constituency in 1971 the children in Falkirk and Grangemouth—not in the Stirling part of my constituency—were going to what were called twilight classes at that time. Half of those children went to school from 9 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon and the other half went to school from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until about 9 o'clock at night.<br><br>
There were many reasons for that—because there were not sufficient teachers and for all the reasons put forward so ably by my hon Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) on behalf of Hamilton college of education. Because successive Governments were able to increase the teacher supply and for a number of other factors, we were able to get over that problem in the Falkirk-Grangemouth area. No system is perfect and we do not claim perfection for any system but we were able to develop education in the Central region in a meaningful way.<br><br>
I tell the Secretary of State that if he closes Callendar Park college he will take the Central region back to the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. Let there be no doubt about that. There will be no point in somebody coming forward in 1983-84 to ask "Why did you not tell us that the consequence of closing Callendar Park would be that children would go back to twilight classes?"<br><br>
We are not talking about an area with the second highest birth rate in Scotland, but one with the highest birth rate in Scotland and if there is any growth in the industrial infrastructure of Scotland it takes place in Central Scotland. We are talking about an area where population trends have continued to increase while they have gone down in other parts of Scotland. Therefore, I tell the Secretary of State that the closure of Callendar Park would be an absolute disaster for education and for the Central region.<br><br>
We are not just talking about preserving college lecturers' jobs, important though that may be. We are arguing an educational case, the need for the development of education. I should not have to persuade the junior Minister on this subject. His inspectorate told him in their last annual report that a development of the primary curriculum was required. I may paraphrase, but they said that we taught the three Rs relatively well and told the Minister that we badly needed to develop the curriculum down through the years at Callendar Park.<br><br>
There is another point in favour of Callendar Park— diversification. The Forth Valley college of nursing and midwifery is now at Callendar Park. Incidentally, I hope that the Minister will expand on his statement to some of the people from Callendar Park, that the Forth Valley health board had no security of tenure there. I have that statement in writing. The Minister for Health is present and will have a vested interest in this matter. The Minister had better tell the Committee whether he was implying, if Callendar Park were closed and a buyer were found for the whole building, that that would mean evicting the Forth Valley college of nursing and midwifery. The Minister has caused some uncertainty
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
in nursing circles throughout the Forth Valley by his statement about the health board not having security of tenure.<br><br>
The college of nursing and midwifery at Callendar Park and the college of education are benefiting from the shared facilities; nurses, for example, benefit from lectures given by the education college lecturers. I now forecast—I do not say this with any disrepect to nurses, particularly those from the excellent school at Inverness which is one of the best that I ever saw when I was Minister for Health—that the nurses who come from the Forth Valley college of nursing and midwifery will be far superior to any others who are trained in a purely nursing and midwifery college because of the benefits that they obtain from the mixed use at Callendar Park college. Therefore, there is a host of arguments in favour of retention of Callendar Park and of Hamilton.<br><br>
I now turn to Craiglockhart. The Secretary of State said that consultations have been proceeding, but I do not know who is being consulted. Since 11 November, the Secretary of State, through the Scottish Education Department, has established a joint working party between Craiglockhart and the SED to discuss a merger. From the beginning, the working party's terms of reference were that the Craiglockhart site had to be vacated. The working party's report was made available to the Secretary of State only yesterday, which is a strange coincidence as the debate is taking place today.<br><br>
In the working party report the Craiglockhart college of education makes it absolutely clear that it in no way has anything to do with the views expressed in paragraphs 2.15 and 2.16. In that report the Scottish Education Department says that there are no consultations with either Dundee or Moray House. So, who is being consulted? I accept that there has been a joint working party between Craiglockhart and the SED, but in my view the Secretary of State misled the Committee when he said that consultations were taking place. Paragraph 2.15 of the report clearly states that no such consultations have taken place with Dundee or Moray House.<br><br>
Any attempt to merge Craiglockhart with either Moray House or Dundee will cause problems not only for Craiglockhart but for the receiving college—Moray House or Dundee. Moreover, the evidence that is called in aid in the report is not only flimsy but years out of date. The report says that no survey was made of the facilities available at Moray House college of education. There is talk of a merger, but no survey has been made. When one looks for the evidence that leads to the belief that there is space available, it is seen that one of the hidden paragraphs of the report mentions a room availability survey. I remember my hon Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) looking for a room in the House of Commons and he did a room availability survey even to the extent of looking in the other place to try to find an office, but he did not find one. But this document is trying to produce rooms from a room availability survey that was carried out in 1978.<br><br>
As regards costs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell<span class='memberconstituency'>(West Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Accepting that there has been sloppy incompetence in this matter by Ministers and their civil servants—I do not normally criticise civil servants—could we come back to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
specific question of the cost estimates if Craiglockhart is to be kept as a unit of a chapel in Moray House? Could the question be repeated?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will obviously hear that intervention from my hon Friend. But as regards civil servants—I say this in the kindest possible way—there comes a time in every Minister's life when he should tell civil servants that they work for the Minister, that the Minister does not work for them. For the Under-Secretary of State the time is today when he should take decisions and not hide behind somebody else.<br><br>
In regards to costs, I have found it astonishing that the Secretary of State could tell us that no costings were available. Clearly, savings will be made. In a written reply last Thursday the Prime Minister said that the abolition of two boards of governors would make substantial savings—a cup of tea and a coffee bun is what the board of governors have every time they go to a meeting. That is the substantial saving that the Prime Minister says will be made. The Secretary of State could not even go to the length today of a cup of tea and a coffee bun because he could not tell us what the savings are.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Hamilton said that the matter has been under review since 6 August, when the statement was published. With respect to him, this matter has been under review every day of this year. We met the Minister in February when we were talking about the colleges of education, yet now, 22 days from the end of the year, the Secretary of State still cannot produce costings on which these proposals are based. He criticised my right hon Friend in 1977, so no wonder he hangs his head in well-earned shame.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will tell us, in view of all the uncertainty about costings—points made by his hon Friends the Minister for Glasgow, Hillhead, and for East Renfrewshire, and by my hon Friends—that the Government have now accepted that they need time for further thought, further consultation, further discussion and further analysis. The Under-Secretary of State seems to find that funny. I can tell him that none of the lecturers or students, none of the people in Falkirk and Hamilton, no one connected with Craiglockhart, finds that in the least funny. It is strange how the Under-Secretary of State can dismiss this issue so lightly in 1980, when in 1977 he was stamping the country talking about the Left-wing attempts to abolish religious education, and he is now doing precisely that to Craiglockhart college of education. He certainly has something to answer for.<br><br>
I make one final point, with which I hope the Under-Secretary of State will deal, on the throwaway line which the Secretary of State gave us about the possibility of retaining an in-service capability in those colleges of education. When the Secretary of State has known for the whole of this year that these were his proposals, it is not good enough for him to come to us and, in his opening speech, throw it at us that those were his proposals. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will tell us precisely what that means. What is the in-training ability that is to be preserved in Callendar Park, Hamilton or Craiglockhart? It is not good enough for the Secretary of State to leave everything so uncertain.<br><br>
I plead with the Minister, because he has a last-gasp
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
chance to do something for his own integrity and reputation, not to throw away that chance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) suggested that we have only one supporter on this side of the Committee this morning. That is one more than his right hon Friend had two years ago in a similar discussion. His right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) did not even have the support of the hon Gentleman, who was then a member of the Government. I think that this is the first speech he has made in Committee or the House on teacher training colleges. His point about costs and other matters, about which he specifically asked me, I will deal with later.<br><br>
The right hon Member for Craigton asked about the Secretary of State's announcement in August and about the promise of consultation. Both points have been fully answered on previous occasions and by my right hon Friend today. I am sure that the right hon Gentleman would be the first to agree that, whatever differences of opinion or misunderstandings about the statement that may have existed in August, there is little value to be had in going over that ground again today in this important debate.<br><br>
Consultations will take place on closures, but consultation would not have succeeded in deciding which of the colleges should be closed. That should be apparent from this morning's debate and from the campaigns that are taking place, supported—we are led to believe—by all the 10 colleges.<br><br>
The right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton asked about savings, and my right hon Friend gave the running costs of £3¾ million in the current year. In addition, as my right hon Friend indicated, to be educationally viable, a 10-college system will produce more teachers over the next few years than are required, and more teachers than will be produced by a seven-college system.<br><br>
It has been said already that we know that the principals of nearly all the colleges complain every year about the intake figures because they are not getting enough students to run their colleges in a viable way. One of the considerations that have to be taken into account, when deciding the number of students to be sent to each college, is whether that college will be able to operate in a viable and efficient way. With declining school numbers, that should not be a major factor in deciding the number of school teachers to train.<br><br>
If we stick to the 10-college system, which is the only option the Opposition and others have put forward, we shall be producing teachers surplus to requirement at a cost of about £2,500 a year each for pre-service training. We are talking about several hundred teachers, and a substantial sum of money that must be taken into account when the savings are being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have these college principals been asking for closures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, of course not. The right hon Gentleman is aware of that. But I shall deal with the question of consultation a little more fully. The right hon Gentleman mentioned that the GTC was, to say the least, disappointed that Hamilton college was to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
closed. It is true that it said so publicly. But, six or nine months ago, the GTC also said that small colleges should be closed. As the right hon Gentleman knows, the GTC is the Secretary of State's principal adviser on these matters. If that is the sort of consultation and advice that one is to have, one is bound to ask the GTC which colleges it would close. That is too difficult a question for it to answer, and it has proved too difficult for anyone else to answer. That is why consultation had to be ruled out and why my right hon Friend had to make the decision himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely pathetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It happens to be the fact of the matter that no one was prepared to sit down and consult about which colleges should be closed, although a number of people, including the GTC, agreed that some colleges should be closed. We should have been consulting between now and Doomsday if we tried to reach agreement with anyone about which colleges should be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary define the difference between a broken promise and a change of mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The facts change, and I shall be coming to that point. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) made a brave speech on that subject.<br><br>
Everyone in the Committee should know that politicians are often accused of changing theeir ground. No allowance is ever made for the fact that sometimes, unless one is a Liberal, the ground changes under one. But, in a brave speech in defence of honour in politics and pleading for the retention of Hamilton college, my hon Friend the Member for Hillhead practised what he preached, because he did not tell the Committee that Jordanhill was in his constituency. Presumably, he is prepared to see further reductions in Jordanhill to save Hamilton. I am sure that my hon Friend agrees that, if we were to keep 10 colleges in being, with declining pupil numbers, there would have to be some transfers from the larger colleges to the smaller.<br><br>
I applaud my hon Friend's forthrightness, but he too might have taken into account the fact that the situation has changed in the past three years, and, in addition, as my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said, Jordanhill is essentially a secondary college. There are more secondary students than primary at Jordanhill, whereas Hamilton is essentially a primary college. The total figures for Jordanhill look very grand: there are more than 2,000 places, but, of those students, 380 are primary and about 500 secondary. Therefore when we talk of the number of teachers being trained in Jordan-bill and Moray House—admittedly, the larger colleges —and compare those with the numbers in the primary colleges, the comparison in the numbers of primary teachers is roughly similar. When we last discussed this subject in Committee, the number of pre-service students in the colleges was almost 9,000, for the session 1976-77; today, there are 4,700. That represents a fall of almost a half. Next year we estimate that there will be 4,600 and the following year 4,400 and so on.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
The right hon Gentleman and my hon Friend were concerned about this point. There is an obvious and clear decline in the number of teachers being trained. The present capacity is 11,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not understand that precisely these figures were given to him by my right hon Friend in 1977? The Minister voted to retain all ten colleges on the basis of those figures. Now, on the basis of the same figures, he is telling us that we should close three of the 10 colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessarily so, but if it proves anything, it means that the Labour Party, when it presented the case three years ago, did so as badly as it is trying to defend the position today.<br><br>
I had some difficulty in understanding the points raised by my hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon Gentleman listens he may be able to contribute to this understanding. Knowing his feelings about this matter, I looked at the distances from the two major parts of his constituency to Jordanhill or Hamilton. From Neilston to Jordanhill is 10 miles; from Neilston to Hamilton is 14 miles, and the journey takes longer and costs more in buses and trains. From Barrhead to Jordanhill is 8 miles and to Hamilton, 14 miles. Again it takes longer on the bus and train and costs his constituents more money. The point is made repeatedly by the college and by Opposition Members that students in the Hamilton area will not travel into Glasgow. But of the 550 students in the residence at Hamilton, over 400 are travelling into Glasgow every day—to Glasgow university, or Paisley tech or one of the Glasgow colleges. Therefore, 400 are travelling every day from Hamilton to Glasgow, yet we are told that if we take the Hamilton college away students in the area will refuse to use public transport into Jordanhill or elsewhere.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) made an excellent speech, concentrating as a mathematician on the facts of the matter, and he was hardly interrupted on those facts by any Opposition Members.<br><br>
The hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), of all people, should not be thumping the table and saying that the costs and financial implications of these decisions must be known. Had the college in Dundee been considered purely on financial criteria, it would have been closed. It was because my right hon Friend was determined that regional considerations, including in-service training, should be taken into account that the college in Dundee has remained in being. The hon Gentleman should be grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman knows that apart from gratitude, a decision to close the Dundee college in view of the regional factors would be inconceivable. Both Governments came to that conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be. My right hon Friend made clear in opening the debate that we are arguing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I1101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
not about whether there should be any college closures but about which colleges should be closed. The inescapable fact that has been ignored, especially by the right hon Gentleman, is that the intake of student teachers has fallen by about two-thirds since 1972, and a small increase is expected in the late 1980s, for which full allowance has been made.<br><br>
That overwhelming evidence of the need to reduce the number of colleges has shifted the argument for the retention of a 10-college system from pre-service training to in-service training. We have always accepted the need for in-service training to continue in Lanarkshire and central Scotland. Surely that can be done without much difficulty. The Hamilton and Falkirk areas are hardly the most remote parts of Scotland, and in-service training is carried out at present in places such as the Highlands and the borders where there are no teacher training colleges at all. For instance, in the current session, Aberdeen college is dealing with 124 teachers in Inverness, 487 in the Highland Region generally and 117 in Orkney. Are the Opposition suggesting that there should be a college in Orkney?<br><br>
Craigie deals with about 550 people in Dumfries and Galloway. Given the distances involved in those cases, it seems clear that the practical problems of providing school-based in-service training in Lanarkshire and the central region can be overcome.<br><br>
As regards in-service training, I agree with the right hon Member for Craigton who said in 1977 that this should be carried out in schools rather than colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about costings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I turn now to the effect of the college closures on the academic and non-academic staff. The actual numbers involved will be known only after detailed consultations with the colleges have been concluded. We have estimated that at least half the academic staff may be given the opportunity to transfer within the overall college system for pre-service and in-service work and if that estimate: proves correct it is likely that redundancies among academic staff will be able to be met on a voluntary basis. I assure the Committee and the staff concerned that we shall make every effort to achieve that.<br><br>
The position of non-academic staff is more difficult. Unfortunately most of those are likely to be made redundant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about costings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In all, therefore, up to 50 academic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
staff and up to 150 non-academic staff may become redundant as a result of the closures.<br><br>
It is clearly in the best interests of all concerned that discussions on the effect of the arrangements on each member of staff and each student should begin immediately. The campaigns to save the colleges have been strong and vociferous and I make no complaint about that, but it is now time to plan ahead, to look to the future of each student and member of staff involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the costings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be no intake to these colleges next year. It is highly desirable that students who may require transfer to another college to complete their studies should have the appropriate arrangements made within the next few months. I have already made clear that the closure of a college does not mean that all the staff will be lost to the system. There will be scope for transfer to other colleges.<br><br>
It is also time to consider the future of the college buildings at Falkirk and Hamilton.</span></p>
