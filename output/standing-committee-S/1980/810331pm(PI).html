	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton (Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The Bill that is being debated in the Chamber today is very important for Scotland, because it affects the constituencies of many Government Members on the Committee. I wonder whether the Ministers might consider adjourning the afternoon sitting so that we attend and take part in that debate, in view of other hon Members' strong interests in the Forestry Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far no Minister has indicated such a desire to the Chair, so we shall proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that just before the Committee adjourned my hon Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) was having a discourse with the Minister. 1 shall leave them to continue that discourse, while I try to confine my remarks to the group of amendments under consideration, and particularly to amendment No. 121.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to go over what I said this morning, but I think that the amendment shows up the class nature of the Bill. Insidious class distinction runs right through it. While we may not win the vote when you call the Division, Mr. Gourlay—it will be for you to decide which amendments the Committee will divide on—I hope that many Conservative Members, particularly those who claim to come from working-class backgrounds, will listen very carefully to what has been said and will vote with the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) is not present this afternoon, because I should have liked to put one or two questions to him. Perhaps I may put them on the record, so that when he has read the 	<i>Hansard</i> report he may take the opportunity to reply, provided he catches your eye, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant during this debate to see who has attended the Committee and to hear the comments that have been made. I should be most interested to hear the comments of the hon Member for Dundee, East on the assisted-places scheme and, in particular, to know what he would say to those whom he represents in Broughty Ferry. Do the residents of Broughty Ferry support the assisted-places scheme? I shall watch very closely, as I am sure they will, to see how the hon Member votes on these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May 1 help the hon Gentleman by saying that the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) has spoken in the debate on these amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his intervention, but the hon Member for Dundee, East did not clarify in my mind whether he was for the assisted-places scheme or whether he was prepared to defy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening to the hon Gentleman and have allowed a certain amount of latitude. What the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) said is on the record. It is not part of the debate to try to find out what other hon Members intend to do. The hon Gentleman should speak to the amendments— there are plenty of them before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New section 75A talks about the benefits of education at grant-aided and independent schools. The Opposition argue that this is a value judgment, which implies that State education is second-rate. We shall certainly argue against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the comments of some Conservative Members that the scheme will somehow help those, particularly those with low incomes, who cannot afford the fees to send their children to these schools. I believe that it will not work. In practice, we shall find that the majority of working-class people will not take advantage of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that about 30 per cent, of the upper middle-class—the radical element who consistently vote Labour—will also reject the scheme. They see it as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
rather tawdry, third-rate carbon copy of the English school system, as pursued at Winchester, Eton and Harrow, with no part in the traditional Scottish education system, which is valued and has the respect of educationists throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That 30 per cent, who consistently vote Labour will not wish to support the assisted-places scheme, nor will the Scottish working class, who hold it in utter contempt, because they do not see these schools as being for their children. No matter how the Minister tries to fudge the issue, the assisted-places scheme is not for working-class children—certainly not for those who live in Ardler, Beechwood, Fintry, Linlathen and Whitfield. Very few of the kids from these areas would benefit from the assisted-places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to see whether the scheme is passed by the Committee and the House and reaches the statute book. When we get rid of the scheme, as we undoubtedly will when we return to power, it will be interesting to read the notes which will be slipped to us by the civil servants saying just how much of a failure the scheme has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working-class people understand that the scheme is not for them, because they see its products and their attitudes, which they do not recognise as being in any way representative of the Scottish working class or showing any understanding of it or connection with it. One has only to look at the rest of the Government's legislation, which cuts into the incomes and welfare benefits of the working class, to understand that Conservative Members have little in common with working-class families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Scots will not consider participating in the scheme because it goes against their idea of social justice, which argues that equality of education should not have to be bought but should be provided by the State and that all children should have equal access to the best elements of education available under a State education system. That is why almost 96 per cent, of Scottish children go to State schools and why such schools can boast of their proud record in producing the type of people that we see in industry, commerce and the House—certainly on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working class is not interested in a scheme that depends entirely on background or finances—which is exactly what the assisted-places scheme is. The Scottish education system has a tradition that stretches back over many years. It is valued and we should all strive to assist. We should argue that, if there are deficiencies in the State scheme, rather than waste money perpetuating a scheme which does nothing for the overwhelming majority of children in Scotland we should tell the Minister that that money could be far better spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we could build a replacement school to which the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) referred during his intervention on the Gaelic language Bill. He said that there was at least one school within the Perth district which was very badly built. It would be far better if he told his right hon Friend that this money should not be wasted trying to assist people to enter a system which will not give them any more benefits than they would receive in the State system. That money should be spent rebuilding that school to ensure that the children in it will benefit. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
cannot remember the name of the school, but I am sure that the hon Member will be able to tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Perth high school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I would rather build a new Ardler high school, I would go along with the hon Member and divert this money from the assisted-places scheme and build a Perth high school. I am certain that the majority of parents and the pupils who have to attend that very badly built school would agree with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing for anyone that I represent in this assisted-places scheme. I hope that Conservative hon Members, including the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire, will join me in voting for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I welcome the opportunity to speak on this group of amendments. I am glad to see that you are back in the Chair, Mr. Gourlay. If there had been a change of Chairman, you would have missed the second half of what I think was a most excellent speech by my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross). I wish to congratulate him, because he got into the kernel of what the Bill is about. He is correct to describe it as a class Bill, because that is exactly what it is. The Minister, despite his attempts, is unable to cloud the issue in my mind and in the minds of all working-class people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear and enjoyed the speech of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who outlined what he thought was the importance of this part of the Bill. While his view differs from mine, he at least reached the same conclusions, although he did not apply the same excellent analysis as my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can accuse Conservative hon Members of not being the champions and defenders of minorities. It would be ludicrous to claim that. They are, and have always been through their long history, the champions of a minority—the 7 per cent, who own 85 per cent, of the country's wealth. This Government, more than any previous Tory Government, have savagely defended the rights and privileges of that lot. Although I do not commend them for it, it ought to be recorded that they, indeed, do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon Member for Argyll was aiming at that point when he spoke of the minority that the assisted-places scheme would protect. We understand that that is the minority that will be protected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory Party is not in accord with the introduction of the Bill. It was interesting to read the report in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 1 December 1980 of the debate when the Secretary of State spoke to young Tories. That report showed that the Scottish Young Conservatives were divided on the issue. The previous day, in what was described in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> as an "acrimonious debate", they defeated by 90 votes to 59 a motion
	<br><blockquote><p>"which called for a change in education policy and greater backing for the comprehensive system."</p></blockquote>
Light, it seems, is dawning for at least some of the Young Conservatives as regards the education system. They are aware of the failings of the Scottish education system at present, even if the Conservative members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
of the Committee are not, and they would certainly not argue in favour of pumping into the private sector money that ought to go into the State sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"denied that the Government were 'clobbering the comprehensive system'"—</p></blockquote>
which indicates that someone had said that they were doing so. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'our overwhelming priority is the betterment of the comprehensive system where 95 per cent, or more of our children are going to be educated.'"</p></blockquote>
The report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. John Renz, of East Edinburgh Young Conservatives, said that there was a deep gulf between those who had received a private education and the rest of the population. 'If more than 90 per cent of children in Scotland go to schools which are second best it is a grave reflection on the Scottish Education Department.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"He doubted whether the assisted places scheme would work or whether children from areas like Niddrie in Edinburgh would be clamouring to go to Fettes."</p></blockquote>
That remains to be seen.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would provide some people with an opportunity on a silver platter to exercise their bias against the state system, Mr. Renz said. He added: 'It is important for the Conservative Party to escape from this cucumber tea attitude to education.'"</p></blockquote>
There is at least one enlightened voice amongst the young Tories, and I am happy to record Mr. Renz's words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Lawrence Haniford was of the opposing camp. He was what one might consider a true blue Tory. He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the assisted places scheme would not help the rich, but families who would like to send their children to private school and could not afford to.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"As for more backing for the comprehensive system, Mr. Haniford said: 'We should leave that … to Foot and Benn.' He went on: 'What comprehensive schools need is not more money but a better standard of teaching.' "</p></blockquote>
Something that may be of interest to members of the Committee is the reference in the article to the "shining stars". We use the word "bright" in the amendment. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Throughout the debate speakers seemed unclear whether the motion was deploring social iniquities or social inequities and jibes about the 	<i>Boys' Own</i> mentality of the pro-assisted places lobby were countered with appeals not to 'hide the shining stars of youth under the muddy blanket of the com-prehensives.'"</p></blockquote>
With that Dickensian view of the comprehensive system, it is not surprising that the present Government have brought in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fee-paying sector of Scottish education has never considered itself to be part of Scottish education, and the people of Scotland have never regarded that sector as a relevant part of their education system. Why should they? Only about 4 per cent, of children attend fee-paying or grant-aided schools. Among the statistics there is one that sticks out a mile. It is that one child in every four at present being educated in the Edinburgh area attends a fee-paying or grant-aided school. If we are to believe the Minister, the grant-aided schools are to be phased out or to become independent. That will mean that one child in four in the Edinburgh area will be educated in this fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to intervene in the hon Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
man's discourse, but, while I agreed that there should be a fairly wide-ranging debate, the hon Gentleman's speech should have been made on Second Reading. The principle of assisted places is already enshrined in the Bill. The Committee may attempt to modify or to change it in some way, but any amendment seeking to reverse the principle already established in the Bill would be out of order, and therefore discussion on those lines is also out of order. I wish to be generous to the hon Gentleman, but he may not make a Second Reading speech opposing the principle in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see, Mr. Gourlay. As usual I am thankful for your helpfulness, but on this occasion you have left me somewhat at a loose end, because the next two-thirds of my speech was on similar lines. I shall therefore confine that to my files, rather than to the dustbin, and perhaps I shall be able to speak on those points at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some aspects of this class-ridden scheme which we ought to consider. The Minister mentioned how much ratepayers would be concerned about the way in which their money was used. All ratepayers are right to be concerned. But he never mentioned the extent to which ratepayers and taxpayers already subsidise the fee-paying schools. That particularly ought to be of interest to the Minister, since the large bulk of them are in his constituency. Perhaps he should have declared that interest at the beginning of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 80 independent or grant-aided schools in Scotland are regarded by the Inland Revenue as charitable organisations, they escape capital gains tax, and the Minister might have mentioned that. That status also qualifies them for rates relief, which causes concern to some ratepayers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again the hon Member is instructing the Committee on matters with which the Bill is not concerned. If schools are registered as charitable institutions, there is nothing that we can do about that under the Bill, and therefore it is not in order to discuss the pros and cons of that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. Gourlay. I shall dispatch this chapter, too, to my files. Would it be in order to refer to the £1,000 subsidies paid for children of officers in the diplomatic service and others in foreign and Commonwealth offices who attend the fee-paying schools in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, too, would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is indeed a pity, Mr. Gourlay, because I was about to say that that totals about £140,000 in Scotland, and that figure might have interested some members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members may claim that this scheme will assist pupils in the comprehensive sector. If the Tories want to assist them, why do they not leave them in the comprehensive sector and improve the quality of the facilities and the education there? That would seem more logical than attempting to hide under this blanket the opportunities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House</i></p>
	<p>5.07 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the sitting was suspended I was dealing with the subject of the cash shortage in the comprehensive sector, and saying that the Minister should advise the Secretary of State for Scotland that he should pump more money into that sector if he is really concerned about the educational needs of the young in Scotland. The Secretary of State obviously does not wish to do that, and is using this channel— though not saying so—simply to ensure the continuation and extension of the privilege that my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the Minister's remarks this morning. I listened most carefully to all that he had to say. In one place I think that he almost made a Freudian slip. He was talking of admission of the fee-paying schools of pupils, or rather of parents who aim to have their children selected for these schools. He used the word "selection" which was perhaps a slip of the tongue. I am concerned that the schools themselves will make the sole choice of who is to be selected, and who is to be admitted. The clause is riddled with loopholes. I should certainly not like—had I even attempted it—to have one of my children given an assisted place in one of the fee-paying schools. I should not like—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that if the hon Gentleman looks at the table, he will discover that he earns too much to qualify for an assisted place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has a point. I was referring to the time when my children were at school. He will be happy and relieved to hear that, despite my youthful appearance, they have left school and will not therefore have the opportunity of attending fee-paying schools. Indeed, if they had ever got near them, it would have been over my dead body. However, as I said, those circumstances do not apply to me, because I have no children of school age, and I do not intend to father any more.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Imagine putting that on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could go further, Mr. Gourlay, but I am sure that you would rule me out of order if I were to list the reasons for that medical impossibility. I am happy for that to be put on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the matter does not arise for me, but I am sure that other mothers and fathers seek avenues through the assisted-places scheme to give their children the dubious privileges afforded by the grant-aided and fee-paying schools. However, I am sure that they will be faced by the class barrier to which we referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is left to the school—I am sure that this will be so —the pupil will be selected not purely on his academic qualities, but also on his background, which will be investigated. If he does not come from a particular sort Of background, the school may refuse him, because these schools greatly prize their reputedly high educa-

tional and social standards. But that is not always true, because those standards sometimes leave something to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister mentioned Gordonstoun school. I was intrigued to see a reference to that school in Monday's 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which will be of interest to the Committee, because it refers to the standards of behaviour in such schools. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Senior boys from Gordonstoun School, Elgin, where Prince Edward is a boarder, are 'no longer welcome' at a restaurant near their holiday hotel in Skye.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A geology field study took the 26-strong Gordonstoun party to the island last Thursday to stay for one week at the Edinbane Hotel on the main road linking Portree and Dun-vegan. By Saturday they were banned from The Lodge restaurant nearby.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Charles MacKinnon, who manages the restaurant with his wife, Margaret, said: 'If they do return they will be told to go back to where they came from'."</p></blockquote>
I assume that he means Gordonstoun.
	<br><blockquote><p>"'They are not welcome here again, except for the two girls. The boys acted like a bunch of yobbos and left the place like a pigsty,' said Mr. MacKinnon. T have never been a supporter of comprehensive education but the behaviour of these Gordonstoun boys has made me have a change of mind'."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, if those boys have achieved anything by their " yobbish " behaviour, it is the conversion of someone who was previously in favour of fee-paying schools to the comprehensive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues, and ends by stating that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Michael Mavor has been headmaster for two years. He was unavailable for comment."</p></blockquote>
No doubt when the yobbos returned to Gordonstoun they were met with the appropriate corporal punishment which the headmaster felt that they deserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the issue of selection or admission. The Minister wanted to know whether we ever asked our constituents how they felt. Clearly, most of us usually ask them for their opinions on various subjects. When I ask the constituents who come to my surgery and others about fee-paying schools in the Kilmarnock district, there is almost no response. Therefore, if there are parents there who want to take advantage of the scheme, they have not contacted me. I have been unable to find them, in my search, but I shall continue to seek them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the list of schools available. I am not sure how many are within the 25-mile radius. Certainly none of them are in my constituency. There are bound to be fee-paying schools in Ayrshire. I should be grateful to have information from the Minister on that. There are certainly fee-paying schools in the Glasgow area. Glasgow is within the 25-mile radius of Kilmarnock, which lies 22.3 miles south-west of it. So my constituents, if they desired, could send their children to a fee-paying school, but I do not know how headmasters at these Glasgow or Ayrshire schools would feel about pupils coming from the Kilmarnock area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the background of the parents who sought this form of assistance was most interesting. I wonder why headmasters should want to know the occupations of parents. However, they must know, because the Minister gave us some statistics. He said that the biggest group of parents in question were teachers. I doubt this, but it may be true. It may well be that the largest group of those who seek assisted places for their children are teachers, but I imagine that if one looked at the records of the parents of pupils attending
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
the school one might find that lawyers and other professional men and women were more likely to form the majority of parents of those attending such schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West pointed out earlier today, such schools are the breeding grounds of those who wish to run society, and parents may feel that in these schools children will be taught the proper lines along which society should be run. For example, the background of naval and army officers in Scotland shows that a large percentage came from such schools. When I was persuing the Navy List the other day I noted that the number of officers above the rank of rear-admiral was in a ratio of two to one of the establishment of our ships. One wonders what they do, and why—if they have had the benefits of education at the schools they attended—they seem to be wasting these benefits. They do not seem to be engaged in any gainful form of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of the education given at these schools; it is a question of privilege. That is the key, and that is what the Minister failed to bring out in his speech this morning. He should be honest. He has accused Labour Members of being dishonest, and yet my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central indicated today that if it were left to him he would abolish fee-paying schools. I confess that my honest feelings are along similar lines. If it were left to me, I would abolish the fee-paying schools tomorrow. If 1 have any opportunity in the next Labour Government to assist in that aim, I shall be happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also asked us whether we had made proper inquiries, yet, consistently and persistently, Opposition Members have asked for the names of authorities or bodies—or indeed a list of individuals— who support the Bill, and, in particular, this clause. From time to time we hear reference to individuals, but never to any bodies, other than the schools themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the Government's consultative paper on clause 5—the assisted-places scheme—the Scottish Consumer Council gave its view, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As indicated in our response to the Government's consultative paper issued last year, we question whether the assisted-places scheme represents an efficient use of resources or is a desirable way of widening parental choice of school. We consider that the money to be made available",—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is again challenging the principle which has already been approved by the House. Perhaps he will come round to discussing any changes by way of supporting the amendments grouped with amendment No. 126.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Gourlay, but perhaps I may quote the last sentence of the comments by the Scottish Consumer Council:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also believe that the schools participating in the scheme are not sufficiently widely dispersed or large in number to afford an equal opportunity for all children from lower income families or from rural areas to take up places."</p></blockquote>
That will be of interest to the hon Member for Argyll. Like my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central, he must have difficulty in determining where in his district there is a school within the 25-mile radius, as promised by the Minister in his statement earlier today. Perhaps schools will be added to the list already
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
published or perhaps entirely new private or fee-paying schools will be built in areas where the 25-mile radius will apply. It would be interesting to hear the Minister's views on that. Are there to be any further additions to the list? Is there a possibility of fee-paying or grant-aided schools mushrooming in those areas to ensure that the formula which the Minister outlined on the 25-mile radius is adhered to?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answers to those questions will be of great interest to Committee members, and especially to my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central, who has already said that in his constituency the only school in the 25-mile radius is a girl's school. That would be difficult for boys unless the school management were prepared to change and to allow boys in. If it did, there would be difficulties with the uniforms, because in St. Leonard's and St. Katherine's girls' school the uniforms are beige and dark brown dresses and beige woollen overcoats. I doubt whether anyone could purchase those with the £80 grant for clothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That grant is supposed to cover all forms of equipment. I am sure that at the school in question that would buy one pair of hockey boots, a complete hockey outfit and perhaps two hockey sticks in case one is broken at some time. Parents could not afford that kind of equipment on the £80. That being so, anyone within the Central Fife area who lived within 25 miles of St. Andrews and who wished to send a girl to St. Leonard's and St. Katherine's girls' school would have difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole scheme is not to provide an opportunity for the working-class and lower-paid to send their kids to such schools. It is covering Tories, particularly those in the Minister's area and in Edinburgh, who wish to send their children to the schools which abound in that area, but because of the difficulties in which they now find themselves—perhaps they were among the small business men who, up until last week, were collapsing at a rate of 200 a week—have found that their means now are such that they cannot send their children to those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the "poor" that we are talking about. It is not the working-class poor who are unemployed and who have been unemployed for some time, such as electricians, plumbers or bricklayers, to whom the Minister referred. They might even be teachers who are unemployed because of cutbacks in education. But they are not the working-class poor referred to, but the new poor who have come into being since the Government came to power, and they are the lower middle-class, as they have become since their businesses have gone under. They are finding themselves—many for the first time in their lives, and God help them—at the labour exchange and unable to find the cash to send their children to these places of privilege, which they recognise as vital if the upper middle-class is to retain the fodder to look after the interests of the other classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon Friend understands that the whole scheme is intended as a sop to those whose businesses have been attacked by the Government's policies. The whole ethos of the scheme is built around the fact that it is not supposed to help working-class parents. It has been deliberately slanted to help those already at the schools to stay

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to my mentor, my hon Friend. The points that he made are absolutely correct. He made them in a comradely fashion, and I accept his advice. He may be surprised to learn that I was not sure about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, it is even worse than I thought. The assisted-places scheme as outlined in the Bill will sow seeds of such bitterness that they will remain for a long time in the minds of the working classes. The record will show, if advantage is taken of the scheme, as it will be, by those whom I mentioned, rather than by the sons and daughters of plumbers and electricians, and so on, that all our fears about the scheme's application will be realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) may have strayed a little this morning from the narrow terms of the amendments, but he was still close to the path compared with the speech that we have just heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an argument about money—although it has been touched on—however much Opposition Members may seek to make it so; nor is it about privilege, or anything to do with the creaming off of brighter pupils in Scottish education. Nothing demonstrates more clearly what it is all about than amendments Nos. 126, 127, 128 and 129. They seek not only the exercise of and the continuance of control in education, but the increase of that control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gang of social engineers in the Opposition dislike intensely the fact that anyone should seek to make a choice on his own behalf or seek to question the system imposed—and such people may have to make a financial sacrifice. The Opposition are about—at least the hon Members for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) and for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) have come clean about it—the wholesale destruction of the private sector of education. I should be happy to give way to any Opposition Member, including the Front Bench spokesman, who may, as my hon Friend the Member for Argyll said, be catching some flak in Scottish Labour education circles at the moment. Now he has the opportunity to redeem himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman can come clean and say that if there is an opportunity in a Labour Government of the future he will be delighted to vote for the abolition of the private sector. If he wants to intervene on that, I shall be pleased to give way. I think that we know what every other Opposition Member thinks about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members have wholly failed to examine the financial contribution bands that exist in relation to the assisted-places scheme.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has suggested that the hon Member for Dundee, East and I are close on this group of amendments. I wish to see how the hon Member for Dundee, East votes, but, having taken your advice, Mr. Gourlay, I read his speech. I was present, but so much was said that I had forgotten. As reported at column 457 of the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of our sitting on 26 March 1981, the hon Member makes his feelings about this aspect of the Bill clear. However, I shall watch carefully to see whether he supports what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that when the hon Member for Dundee, West eventually decides to send his children to that excellent school in his home city, Dundee high school, he will discover to his great dismay that the income that he presently enjoys is far too great for him to be able to participate to the extent of 1p. It is not a wholly frivolous or fanciful suggestion that he will adopt that course. In a year or two, if his district council carries on in the way that it is doing, he will send his children to no other school in that city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must carry on. I have been referring to the hon Member for Dundee, West and not to the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is most offensive of all in the approach of Opposition Members is that at the same time as they make this direct and indirect attack on the private sector in education they also seek to pretend that theirs is the only party in this House that has any regard to article 2 of the protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. If they look at that for one second, they must appreciate that it ensures that throughout Europe in both the public and private sectors the right of parents to educate their children according to their own wishes is enshrined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely someone from the Opposition—perhaps only the hon Member for Cathcart—knows that article 2 has its genesis in what happened in Nazi Germany. An attack on the private sector in education is a far wider matter than dribbling around and making extraordinary excuses and complaints about what is right for Scottish education. Those are irrelevant. The issue is far bigger than that, and the hon Gentleman should have the courage to admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the three arguments that have been advanced to oppose the assisted-places scheme. I have been in the Committee Room for almost the whole debate, and not one Labour Member has addressed himself to the net additional cost to the public sector to educate those who are not presently, or under the scheme, to be educated in the private sector, or to what would happen to them. We know that the scheme will cost about £3^ million if wholly taken up. But no attempt has been made by any Opposition Member to work out what it will cost if all those children are instead educated in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About £6 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>517</span>
on secondary education, current expenditure in 1981-82 will be £556 million. We are talking about an absolute maximum of £3£ million, regardless of any capital expenditure on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is intellectually the most feeble part of the Opposition's whole approach. We have heard that from that £3£ million we shall get complete help for disabled pupils in Scotland and have extra teachers. There has been a proposal that a new school should be built in Alloa and Ardler high school will be built. Fortuitously, even my hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) has been promised that Perth high school will be rebuilt. The £3^ million represents less than 1 per cent, of education expenditure in Scotland at present. Therefore, it is intellectually feeble to suggest that, by doing away with the assisted-places scheme, there would be a significant alteration to education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point on the attack launched on the assisted-places scheme concerns the line of argument that suggests that it will amount to a creaming off of the better pupils in Scotland and, as such, is to be treated as an insult to the public sector of education. I can think of no greater insult to those whose children are in the public sector and who teach in the public sector than to suggest that, by taking, at maximum, 4,000 children out of a secondary school population of 399,000, no cream will be left in the public sector. If that is what the Opposition consider to be the intellectual strength and quality of our children and the teachers who might be educating them in Scotland, it tells me much more about the Opposition and their confidence in public sector education in Scotland than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no hesitation in supporting that part of the educational structure in Scotland, but I see no merit in the Opposition's attempt to lay every part of the blame for anything in a system that is not right at the door of this scheme, which will do no more than broaden the base of the private sector in Scotland. That is what it is all about. Eventually they resist that more than anything else. When, as they have all agreed, they want to see private education in Scotland abolished, it will be that much more difficult, because the children of families with relatively modest incomes will be involved. They know perfectly well that if that is allowed to happen in those circumstances, it will be much more difficult to get that extraordinary desire of theirs through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke at some length, for him, and made a variety of points. He began with the premise which I imagine lies at the heart of his case. In conceding that this scheme is for a minority—at most 1,500 pupils—he argued that the Conservative Party sought to defend the rights of minorities. He made no attempt to deny that a right enjoyed by a minority in some respects at the expense of the rest of the community is not a right but a privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument was advanced by Tawney many years ago, and it is one to which the Labour Party has always subscribed with regard to public school education. The Opposition's objection to the private sector of education is that if such a thing is to exist it should be funded by those who wish it, and by nobody else. That is the basis upon which at least one of our amendments rests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
Amendment No. 120 makes it clear that if the private sector of education is to be sustained—one is always caught up in the difference between public and private schools—it should be sustained by those who want it to exist. That is the Labour Party's view. It was the view of the last Labour Government, and it is likely to be the view of the next one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon Gentleman is on the subject of the view of the next Labour Government, will he answer the important point put to him by my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) about private education.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry. Had the hon Gentleman been listening to all that I have said he would probably have heard me say that if there is to be a private sector in education in this country it will be sustained by the private sector. We do not want to see it retained, but, equally, as Labour Governments have found out, it is difficult to do away with the private sector of education. It is difficult to legislate against that. The Labour Party's view is simple. It was decided—or reconfirmed— at the last Labour Party conference, and this view is embodied in amendment No. 120, that the private sector of education should be sustained by the private sector and should receive no support or succour in the form of tax rebates, charitable status or anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The extension of rights to individuals from the public to the private sector is an argument which is accepted by the Minister in the context of parents' rights, but he did not accept it for the prospectuses laid down by all the schools in the private sector— those schools which will not participate in the scheme. That principle was certainly not adopted by his hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) when those of us on the Committee considering the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>519</span>
suggested that the right of private tenants to purchase their own houses should be enshrined in legislation, and that there should be rebates. I do not wish to develop the point further, as I do not wish to provoke you, Mr. Gourlay, but there is a certain inconsistency in the Government's attitude towards so-called inalienable rights in the private and public sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would be no new funding. I disputed that, and he went on to say that the amount spent in 1979-80 was £1.1 million and in 1980-81 it was £2.3 million. A figure approaching £5 million was helpfully provided by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association—perhaps as the result of a parliamentary question from the hon Member for Argyll or in answer to a question that someone other than the Secretary of State asked him to put down. An increase in funding is implicit in that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that if that figure is accepted, £5 million is not a massive expenditure in the context of total expenditure on Scottish education. That does not make it any the less offensive. Being stung by a fly is no less offensive than being stung by a poisonous mosquito.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We regard this as the expenditure of public money on a section of the community which we consider to be already privileged. We have to keep coming back to the point that the money will disappear in the general accounts of the public schools, and will be used to defray the general expenses of providing education in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about methods of selection, and that is what is implicit in our reference to bright children. I shall return to that point. In the past few hours I have been able to obtain from the library a booklet called " Scholarships at Independent Schools " which is produced by Truman and Knightley Educational Trust Ltd. I took the opportunity to go through it—although not yet exhaustively, because of the lack of time, but I shall return to it in a later debate, when it will be just as relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a cursory glance I notice that at least five schools, Fort Augustus Abbey School, Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, Merchiston Castle and George Heriot's school all make provision for bursary examinations. I realise that that sample is perhaps unrepresentative, and I have not yet gone through the whole booklet. But that list undermines, if it does not give the lie to, the Minister's case that somehow in Scotland there is no great tradition of using examinations as a means of assessing the suitability of young people to participate in a bursary scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are discussing here is a State bursary as distinct from one which is privately funded. But there have been attempts in the past to fulfil the requirements of the original charitable charters of those institutions, and, in the main, where such schemes have been available, it has been done through the medium of an examination. It is usually a post-12 examination, and interestingly enough, in some areas we are seeing the introduction of sixth-form scholarships for youngsters coming—probably—from the State system when they feel that by going to the private sector they can obtain training for particular courses. Again, the range of such bursaries is extremely limited. In the five schools
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
which I quoted the scope and number of bursaries is so limited as to suggest that their use is merely a figleaf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to stretch your patience, Mr. Gourlay, but simply want to answer the point that the Minister made in his reply. If he was in order in making it, I submit that I am in order in replying to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of ability to pay was dealt with by the Minister in a somewhat cavalier manner. He asserted that in the main it was the teachers who were seeking to benefit from the scheme. He suggested that there was a lack of confidence among teachers in their own profession, or a contempt for the service in which they operated, or a reluctance to have their children exposed to the working-class children who attend State schools. I do not know what reasons are advanced, but the Minister said that teachers were all desperate to get their kids into those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, my research into the subject is not extensive, but I have taken the opportunity to peruse the Scottish teachers' salary memorandum for 1980. That document lays down the basic salary scales. One assumes that in the main teachers who have children over the age of 12 will have been teaching for about 12 years, and will be at the top of their scales. The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is experienced in these matters, and I do not think that he would disagree. It is not unusual that within a couple of years of a teacher's starting work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was beginning to develop the argument about the extent to which school teachers will benefit from the scheme. The Minister seemed adamant that school teachers were most active in seeking to exercise their rights under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked at the Scottish teachers' salaries memorandum of 1980, which lays out the basic salary scale. From my experience of teaching, the basic salary scale is not the most accurate guide to the salaries earned by teachers at the top of the scale. I am sure that there will be statistics somewhere in this document, and we may return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responsibility payment scheme operates for teachers. It is an arrangement whereby responsibility carried by teachers—in a departmental role, in administration and management of the school, or perhaps in a pastoral role—is rewarded on a pro rata scale, based on the size of the school, the number of pupils and the number in senior departments of the school. It is therefore not impossible for a teacher to receive a basic salary plus a responsibility payment considerably in excess of £1,500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether the hon Member can condense his remarks by saying that a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
teacher earns a salary of £X. Perhaps he would reach the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have concluded, Mr. Gourlay, that our proceedings are being regarded with some interest by the teaching profession. I would not say that the staff rooms of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the Committee is discussing amendments, it is doing so for the benefit of its members, so that they can decide how to vote. We are not concerned with whoever may read the report of our proceedings later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was endeavouring to point out to you, Mr. Gourlay, that it is important that the case be explained in the fullest way possible, if not for the benefit of teachers, then certainly for the benefit of Conservative Members, who have shown in their speeches that they know precious little about Scottish education. It is important to explain to them the nature of teachers' wage structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled that discussion of the wage structure of teachers is not in order, even used as an analogy in pursuing the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I can say, Mr. Gourlay, is that you allowed the Minister to raise the canard of teachers' ability to pay, and I was merely replying to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precious few teachers with children of 12 years and over will be able to benefit to any great extent from the scheme. I do not deny that they will get some money, but I think that precious few will benefit to any extent, given that only about 1,500 children, at the most, will be able to attend schools under the assisted-places scheme. What is more, there is no guarantee that the children of members of the teaching profession are any more or less intelligent, or any more or less easy to integrate in a social sense, than are those in any other group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By whatever means the Minister chooses to allow the schools to test eligibility for selection, his assertion that because teachers wish to avail themselves of the scheme it must be praiseworthy in some way is irrelevant. It suggests to many of my hon Friends, however, that there is within the local authority sector of Scottish education a fifth column that does not have the interests of the local authority schools at heart and does not seek to fight for improved conditions, but simply moans about the level of rates and often forgets that those rates provide much of the educational expenditure and also pay the wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the glib way in which the Minister has avoided being specific about the other areas of provision that are not included in the regulations but which we feel must be considered. I am thinking of scientific equipment. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) explained to us that in some institutions extra fees are charged. If those fees are at a different rate, it may well be within the powers of the Secretary of State to allow such fees to be remitted. The school
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
might, however, choose to raise the money in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister be more specific—I hope that he will stop writing his memoirs and pay attention to what I am saying—about what he will do about those schools, some of which charge special fees for the provision of equipment for students of science subjects in the senior forms and some of which do not do so, but simply charge a subject fee. I am not trying to filibuster, Mr. Gourlay. This matter arose out of the debate and the Minister did not really reply to it, perhaps because my original question was not succinct enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will ask the question again in a different way. I have looked at the fee scales in some of the booklets, and I see that certain schools have a special fee for children who are studying science courses, for which more expensive equipment is needed. Will those fees be remitted under the scheme? Other schools do not charge such a fee, but simply make an additional charge, which is not so specific. Will the Minister treat both groups in the same way? Has he thought about the matter? Will he differentiate between the groups?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purposes of the scheme the fees will be calculated in a uniform way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that, because the publication "Which School?" for 1980-81, produced by ISIS Scotland, gives a variety of means of calculating the fees. I hope that the Minister will publish a list of all the fees of the schools in a uniform manner, so that when we examine the expenditure on the scheme we can see where it will go. I hope to consider at a later stage the number of pupils who can be expected to be attracted to any school. I shall do so in the light of the Secretary of State's reply yesterday to the question asked by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). The Minister has kindly provided us with copies of that. Because of my mailing arrangements I did not receive my copy until lunchtime, but I believe that the Minister made a strenuous attempt to provide the copies for us for the morning sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has replied to the debate, but we are not satisfied with many of his replies. I do not think that that was altogether unexpected. We do not accept the central thrust of his argument that the creation of the assisted-places scheme will somehow break down the class barriers of society. We contend that it will simply serve to reinforce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is preoccupied' with helping a small group of relatively poorly-paid people. We have yet to see the criteria that will be applied and learn how many really low-income families will be included. From a cursory glance at the regulations, I feel that there are anomalies "in the amounts of money to be paid to some groups at certain income levels. There is also the question of the family income supplement and supplementary benefits, and the Minister could get himself into the kind of minefield that besets the grey areas of the poverty trap in our social security system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stop my hon Friend in full flow, but I feel that I must intervene. He spoke about actual income levels. He also referred to ISIS. I did not notice that that book had been made available to the Committee. Can my hon Friend say where we can get the booklet, so that we can all look at it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: am grateful to my hon Friend for raising that point. Opposition Members have received copies of an ISIS booklet, "Which School?", through the good offices of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which takes a great interest in these matters. It has an education committee which is extremely active on the Bill and holds many consultations with Opposition Members. The ISIS booklet, which can be obtained from the regional director of ISIS (Scotland), 22 Hanover Street, Edinburgh EH2 2EP, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish Independent Schools Information Service (ISIS Scotland) was established in the belief that independent schools should be fully recognised as an important part of the country's educational provision. Scottish ISIS wishes parents and others to be aware of the choice of schools open to them and aims to provide clear and accurate information about the range of opportunities offered by the independent and grant-aided schools in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The function of ISIS (Scotland) is to provide basic information to assist parents and guardians to make their own choice. It cannot recommend specific schools. Further information can, however, be obtained by writing to the individual school".</p></blockquote>
I suspect—although I am not sure—that that body is supported by some chain of insurance brokers who have an interest in the financial arrangements of those who can afford to pay the fees. However, I may be wrong there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wise of the hon Gentleman to be careful about putting on the record an assumption of which I have no knowledge. I am not aware that this body does anything other than represent the interests of the independent schools in Scotland. For the sake of the record, and in the interests of the hon Gentleman himself, I think that he should withdraw the suggestion, which I believe from his remarks to be entirely without foundation, that the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is promoted for profit by insurance companies or some similar types of organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that that body is promoted for profit. I said that it might well be funded by a chain of insurance brokers or bodies such as that. That may not be so, but that was my assumption. If the Minister is correct, the record will show that to be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should declare an interest as an insurance broker. Indeed, the firm with which I was once employed .acted as secretary to the school fees schemes of a number of independent schools. The hon Gentleman's allegations are entirely without foundation and cast something of a slur on the entire insurance profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps if the Chair had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
been a little more vigilant it would have prevented the hon Gentleman from going out of order, and he would have been saved this embarrassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I can say is that what I consider to be a fairly innocent remark, which was not made in any pejorative sense, seems to have inspired the reaction which, in my estimation, greatly outweighs any offence that could have been taken from my remarks, and which was certainly not intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that what I had said indicated that any further remarks on that matter would be out of order, since the previous remarks were out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. My observations are on the record, as are the observations of other hon Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This booklet provides an outline. It is one of several publications on which we may have cause to comment. These publications make it clear that the rate of fee and the amount of money that is to be available to assist with the fees could cause difficulties at the lower end of the wage range. We shall be interested to see how many of the poorest and the poor will benefit from the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the sum of £3 million that is to go to the schools will be in the form of a subsidy, because some of the schools that will benefit from the arrangement—for example, Fort Augustus Abbey, Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College and Merchiston Castle school—have hitherto been independent. I understand—and the Minister may wish to correct me —that those schools have never received money from the Government in respect of such an arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: hope to be helpful to the hon Gentleman. I must point out that there is no subsidy to the schools. The money is directed entirely to the parents of the children who attend the school, to enable the parents to pay the school fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have yet to see whether these schools will increase their student numbers as a result of the scheme. It remains to be seen whether the children on the assisted places scheme will take places that would otherwise go to young people whose parents would be able to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not made that point, and he may wish to return to it, that if the schools take additional students their fees will help to defray the costs of the other students. There will be some economies of scale. I admit, however, that if the amounts of money about which we are talking—£12,000 for the Fort Augustus Abbey school, £10,000 for Edinburgh Academy, £20,000 for Fettes College and £10,000 for Merchiston Castle school—are in respect of one pupil getting a maximum remission, that will not involve many pupils. Only experience will tell in this respect, because we do not know how many youngsters will be accepted for the schools. We still do not know the scheme under which the acceptance procedure will be carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to vote on amendments Nos. 126 to 129, and on No. 121. We crave the indulgence of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
the Committee in not proceeding with amendments Nos. 118, 119 and 120. I gave you a note of that, Mr. Gourlay. The Labour Party is not concerned to help the private sector of education or to give it succour. We should like to see the clause disappear, because it will serve only to reinforce the class differences in society and protect an already over-privileged minority. If these bodies are to exist, they should exist without any support from the community and the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments advanced by the Government are not acceptable to us, and we therefore wish to take the opportunity to vote along the lines suggested. We hope to return on Report to amendments Nos. 118, 119 and 120.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) the Secretary of State should carry out a survey of all grant aided or independent schools providing secondary education to ascertain whether it will be possible to secure art equitable distribution of assisted places throughout Scotland between boys and girls throughout the ability range.".</p></blockquote>
We recognise that this Government of laissez-faire economics have had little time for planning. They have not tried to plan the assisted places

scheme in any meaningful way. They announced the scheme some months ago and then hawked it around the highways and byways of Scottish education. They attracted a variety of schools most of which are, I confess, in the scheme, but they do not appear to have achieved a geographical spread that covers the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it fair to say that all of us on the Opposition Benches remain to be convinced that there is not a child in Scotland who lives less than 25 miles from the nearest school. We have said that in some regions such as Central region, that is not true, although I concede that perhaps if we had a wall map with little flags—I am not sure whether it would be in order for the Minister to produce visual aids in Committee—it would help us to understand more clearly the geographical distances involved. I do not know whether the Minister is interested in cartography, but we should all have been grateful if he had been able to furnish us with a map which he could put on the wall or even suspend from the microphone wires. Perhaps we could have had several maps as in a classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder what relevance distance has to the amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will remember from your capacity when you are not in the Chair. Mr. Gourlay, the phrase "equitable distribution thereof" is contained in clause four of the Labour Party constitution. The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"an equitable distribution of assisted places"</p></blockquote>
implies a geographical or, to use a more modern expression, a spatial dimension which means that there should be a distribution not only with regard to ease of accessibility. As I said, we are not convinced about the 25-mile radius of each school, and it might have assisted us to have seen the position on the map.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall try to clarify the position before we go on discussing distance for too long. As I interpret it, the hon Member's amendment seeks to ascertain, by way of a survey, the existing situation, and will require an equitable distribution in existing schools. If the hon Member wants to introduce more private schools, the amendment should have said that, but, as I understand it, that inference should not be drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay, but the fact that I had written down
	<br><blockquote><p>"all grant aided or independent schools"</p></blockquote>
meant that all schools in the private sector in Scotland should be considered. Perhaps the Minister would like to re-examine this and not make it simply a matter of the schools volunteering. The Schools could have been involved by a system of incentives. The fee remission scheme may not be well known. I think that we have to admit that in many respects the schools were buying a pig in a poke—for want of a better expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures concerned were published only yester-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
day, and while they may have been discussed behind closed doors in St. Andrew's House for months or even years, it seems that only schools that sought to participate have in fact done so. Therefore, if we are to have an equitable distribution, perhaps other establishments in Scotland could have come within the ambit of the scheme. That would have enabled many parents who live outwith the 25-mile radius to consider, with some equanimity, sending their children to a certain school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, parents are entitled under the Bill to send their children to these schools, but some of us have grave misgivings about the time it would take for children to travel from their homes to the educational institutions concerned. It is commonly regarded, Mr. Gourlay—and I think that your experience in local Government would bear this out— that there is a maximum time for which children should be expected to travel, partly because of the amount of time that they have to spend at school, partly because of travel circumstances such as the bus services in Scotland, and partly because of the desirability of young people being able to participate in the full range of activities provided by the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the interesting points which jumps out of the pages of books such as "The Schools of England" which is "a book of reference for parents". In lighter print beneath the title it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wales, Scotland and Ireland, with tutors, careers and continental sections".</p></blockquote>
The book makes clear the range of extra-curricular activities which the schools provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfortunate if any well rounded education should deny children the opportunity to participate in the full range of activities offered. Therefore it is vital, if the Minister is to present the scheme to the country at large, that he does so having made all strenuous efforts to ensure that all the schools in Scotland capable of participating in the scheme have not only been given the opportunity to participate but have been made aware of the amount available in the form of fee remission if they take advantage of the scheme. We should like a survey to cover the question of distance for the equitable distribution of assisted places at all grant-aided and independent schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, we wish to ensure that equal opportunities are available to both sexes. One of the most distasteful aspects of this thoroughly distasteful system is that among many families in Edinburgh, which is the capital not only of Scotland but of fee-paying Scotland, it is considered appropriate to spend the available money on fees for boys but not for girls. I can remember from my own days at school and from my days as a teacher that there were often girls at the schools that I attended or taught in whose brothers went elsewhere because the parents felt it more important that the boys should have an education and that the girls should take second best.

It is essential that strenuous efforts be made to redress that imbalance so that the opportunities may be shared by both sexes. We recognise that there may be fewer places in fee-paying schools in Scotland for girls than there are for boys. Some of us would say that that simply bears out the argument that I have advanced from my experience. But it imposes

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
upon the Government a responsibility to try to ensure that even more of the schools for girls are included in the scheme and that even more girls are encouraged to participate, if only to redress the imbalance between the sexes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I come to the question of ability range. The Bill is just another example of the Government's Pontius Pilate approach to enforcement of any kind. They have said that they will leave things to local authorities under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act and under the Tenants' Rights, etc. Act, and in this instance they will leave the selection of children to the schools. The Government will give the schools the money to do with as they wish; they can spend it on whatever type of child they wish, regardless of the educational needs of the children. The Government are prepared only to provide the money. It is up to the schools to use it as they see fit.

As we know, a variety of tests are available. The Minister has suggested that the old examinations and tests with stereotyped papers—an English essay plus a paper in arithmetic and a couple of papers in general knowledge—may represent an out-of-date approach. It may have penetrated those bastions of educational conservatism that there are other methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some schools which deal with children with special educational needs. George Watson's college in Edinburgh has a scheme for the assistance of dyslexic children which has achieved a degree of fame throughout the Scottish education system. It is possible that in some schools a wide range of pupils will be allowed in and that responsibilities in respect of their special educational needs will be met. There are children whose needs are outwith the ambit of the normal education service. Perhaps the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), the Minister responsible for health and social work, will be able to advise us on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some schools which cross the ability range but there are not enough of them. We do not know which they are. The Minister freely admitted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
that he did not know which schools would provide testing and which would not. Earlier this evening, I quoted briefly from "Scholarships at Independent Schools"—priced £2-25, and published by the Truman and Knightley Educational Trust Ltd. That body has gathered together the whole range of schools in the United Kingdom which offer scholarships for fee remission. There are quite a few Scottish schools in the scheme, but not so many as would suggest that all the schools in Scotland will necessarily adopt the system. I have already given examples of some of them, and later in the debate I shall give further examples. But the mere fact that scholarships are available and that they are awarded by an examination system does not suggest that across the ability range places will be available for children to participate in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admits that he does not know the position on the ability range. He says that he thinks that the English legislation is different and that, from the total figures, this availability is more likely in England because of the experience there of the examination system and the children will be assessed prior to participating in the scheme. We are not satisfied with that answer. We think that the Minister was making a manful attempt to answer a point on which he did not have a great deal of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with the best will in the world, it is most unlikely that any hon Member on the Government Back Benches will be prepared to vote with us to defeat the legislation. I should like to think that some will, but if they do not we are faced with the problem of not knowing for certain to what extent the children will be from the schools in question. The Minister has said that the range would be 25 miles. I have grave doubts about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
