	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the main part of the Bill, and we have just dealt with a long Government amendment dealing with denominational schools. We have not dealt with new Sections 30A and 30B. These are disarmingly headed "Miscellaneous". Whenever I see that word printed, especially on accounts, I begin to worry because, as sure as fate, something is hidden under it. We are asked to put these two sections after section 30 in the principal Act, under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty of parents to provide education for their children"</p></blockquote>
which seems a strange heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no great quarrel with the purpose of new Section 30A. I take issue with some of the things said by the Minister, who was quoted extensively in the press on the Bill. He often implied that the local authorities are especially bad at making consultative arrangements and that this type of clause is necessary so that they will engage in consultation. However, the record is interesting and salutary. Most local authorities, especially those that are Labour-controlled, when they engage in consultation pay attention to the representations that are made to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as the last one did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as the last Labour Government did on colleges of education. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not think that the Minister will be on the carpet for missing the last vote. I am sure that the Secretary of State for Scotland will forgive him. When the present Government consult, it is largely a charade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We stick to our guns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>670</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member says, revealingly, "We stick to our guns". "Guns" is the right word. In many instances, the Government are pointing guns at people. Either there are shotgun weddings or decisions are made with pistols pointing at people's heads. That military allusion is most appropriate. Many of us have seen today the representatives from the Callendar Park college of education who have emphasised that the basis on which the Government were supposed to be consulting was a total charade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take a local authority at random, the Lothian regional council. I choose that council because it is known to the Minister. Occasionally he praises it; more often he criticises it. Two examples spring to my mind. One is the proposed changes in catchment areas, which was the subject of extensive consultation in the Lothian region two or three years ago. After representations from many people, substantial changes were made. The local authority undertook the consultations without any prodding or statutory requirement. It did so on its own initiative and without any pressure from the Government. Furthermore, the authority took account of the views put to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was proposed that there should not be a separate school at Balerno, but after consultations and representations the decision was changed. But this Government's public expenditure cuts—those of the penny-pinching Tories—made the decision that was taken in the halycon affluent days of the Labour Government impossible to implement. I do not oppose the proposed new section 30A, but it is ironic that it comes from a Government who pay no attention to representations made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not know whether everybody has realised the implications of the proposed new section 30B, although from the way that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) has reacted he seems to have done so. It states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority shall submit to the Secretary of State for his consent any proposal of theirs (of a prescribed kind) and shall not implement such a proposal without his consent."</p></blockquote>
The proposal continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'prescribed' means prescribed for the purposes of this section by the Secretary of State by regulations for the time being in force and the Secretary of State may prescribe different kinds of proposals in relation to different education authorities."</p></blockquote>
My interpretation of new section 30B is that a Secretary of State may prescribe for authorities those matters which have to be approved by him. The Minister told us earlier that this is a great libertarian Bill which gives powers to local authorities. Understandably, he cited certain schemes for the provision of education as examples. But if the Secretary of State sees a local authority introducing a scheme for the development of community schools, for instance, he can say that such a change will be prescribed. So he will have a veto. Therefore, if any local authority—theoretically autonomous—wants to do something which the Secretary of State does not like, he will be able to prohibit the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been previous mention of draconian powers, and that seems one of the most draconian of all. It has been introduced under the heading "Miscellaneous" in the Bill and
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty of parents to provide education for their children'"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>671</span>
in the 1980 Act. If we did not have enough reason on the question of denominational schools and the discrimination we were talking about earlier to vote against the amendment, that, surely, is a strong reason for voting against the clause. I hope that some hon Members on the Government side now realise the import of what they will be voting for. There will not always be a Tory Secretary of State. They should think of the implications when there is a Labour Secretary of State. In some contexts, I might delight in that, but for the autonomy of local government in carrying out proposals this is a retrograde step. I cannot understand why it has been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the notes on clauses, of which I finally obtained a copy. All it does is put into slightly simpler form what is included in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is useless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and not worth the expensive paper on which it is printed. It gives no reason. There is no rationale behind it, no explanation, no indication of what leads up to it, what kind of pressure brought it about, or where the inspiration came from. I hope that some hon Members will have realised what they are letting themselves in for and may take it upon themselves at least to make representations to the Under-Secretary of State about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), I am disturbed by several matters in the clause. I am concerned at the placing of the clause in the principal Act. Presumably, all this which is to be added will in the end form part of section 30, which now reads, under the heading "Duty of parents to provide education for their children"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the parent of every child of school age to provide efficient education for him suitable to his age, ability and aptitude either by causing him to attend a public school regularly or by other means."</p></blockquote>
That is perfectly straightforward, but it does not seem to bear any relation to what we are debating today. It has no relevance to the local authority having to go to the Secretary of State for consent for particular schools and so on. I have read the totality of section 30. I have not missed anything. It is a short section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must put further questions to the Minister, because I have read both the clause and the amendments that we have already passed. Section 21 of the Act is concerned with the management of denominational schools. Section 22 concerns
	<br><blockquote><p>"Discontinuance and moves of educational establishments."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what clause 6 is about. It is about the management of denominational schools and the discontinuance and moves of educational establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister thinks I am nit-picking, but what concerns me is that, having read clause 6 and the amendments, I find no reference to the relationship between them and sections 21 and 22 of the Act. I wonder whether it has been looked at carefully enough by the Minister's advisers so that they can say that what they are doing in clause 6, which will become sections 30A, 30B and 30C of the principal Act, and how it bears upon what is said in those two sections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>672</span>
I should like to know whether the proposal alters the two sections, because it does not say so in clause 6. If it does not alter those two sections in any way, will it create difficulties in that in those sections there will be matters still on the statute book that are contrary to what we are now putting on the statute book in the new section? That may sound a little convoluted, and a bit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and a little bit Irish, as my hon Friend says, but I do not think it is. We must be careful that we do not put matters into the same Act that contradict what is in an earlier part of it, and that we do not store up problems for ourselves in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new section 30B, there seems a curious contradiction in what the Minister has been saying. He has said that he wishes to give local authorities greater power to close or not to close schools—non-denominational, not denominational, schools. He has said that that is the way to do it, as long as the parents are assured proper rights of consultation. However, new section 30B appears to contradict that. I hope that the Minister will make clear that the new section refers only to what we passed in the long amendment, in terms of the denominational schools, and that, essentially, they do not have to come to him for consent. For section 30B mentions "his consent". It says nothing about "his consent following upon consultation" with the local authorities, parents or anyone else. All it says is that they have to come to him for his consent, and if he does not give his consent they can do nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a great plea that one reason why he has taken this course is that if parents appealed to the Secretary of State about a certain matter he could not just fob them off with an answer; he had to investigate it and have genuine consultation before he could take a decision. His reason for making this provision was to short-circuit that process and to bring it into logical shape by ensuring that parents could have a say but that the local authority would then have the final say and there would be no appeal to the Secretary of State. That would speed up the process, because the local authorities were complaining that it was too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the process will not be too long if section 30B is carried out, because all one does is say to the Secretary of State "We want to do this", the Secretary of State says "No", and that is the end. There is no consultation that I can see in the new section. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply and I hope that, although he has not been listening for the past few minutes, he will reply to the debate and not simply allow it to be passed over. Important points have been raised that need clarification, and he should give us some answers before we decide whether to vote for or against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will do, but I shall vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, so shall I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>673</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has had his instructions, he will vote against. He has never been good at making up his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister would be quiet, I might be able to develop my argument. I thought that I had left the rebuking of schoolboy pranks behind when I ended my days in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What distresses us about the clause, for a start, is that it is not the sort of provision that can readily be amended. One can only cut out and hope that what is removed will not appear again. It gives the Minister draconian powers which he can use in almost any way he wishes. As my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said, the Minister made great play of the fact that here he is taking powers and giving them to local authorities—the great libertarian Minister devolving powers. I would rather take the view that we took about amendment No. 202, which we discussed some time ago. It was not so much the giving away of powers as the abdication of responsibilities. Here we see the Minister taking on responsibilities which are so vague and unspecific as to be quite disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the clause be fitted into section 30 or into some other part of the Act? Clause 6 is a miscellaneous clause. For "miscellaneous" I suppose we could read "dog's breakfast". We have discussed the new section about the closure of schools fairly well, but it is worth saying that the closure of schools will now be that much easier if the clause goes through. That is in keeping with the Government's policy of taking advantage of falling rolls in order to spend less on education rather than more, as many of us would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will enable the Minister to set the closure of schools within some kind of framework. He will be able to say that he is not responsible for closing schools, yet if a local authority has a scheme for closing certain schools while constructing a new school in another part of the same area within the framework of a rolling programme lasting, say, 10 years, it will be within the Minister's power under the new arrangement to say that the plan is simply not acceptable to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is dealing with the clause as if it applied only to school closures. What worries me is that ultimately it will come under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty of parents to provide education for their children"</p></blockquote>
in part II of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which in turn is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rights and duties of parents and functions of Education Authorities in relation to Individual Pupils".</p></blockquote>
The effect of the clause is therefore not limited to school closures. It could cover any aspect that comes under those headings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was about to mention that. If a local authority started to develop an education plan involving the closure of schools because of population movements, slum clearance or urban redevelopment, the Minister could give the authority unconditional permission to close schools in the inner urban areas but then refuse it permission to open a school in another part of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>674</span>
city. He could insist that existing buildings were used. That must be where the duty of parents to provide education for their children arises. That must be the loose and shaky peg on which the amendment that the clause makes to the 1980 Act hangs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is an extraordinarily convoluted method of approaching the issue. Certain of its provisions could have been inserted elsewhere. The wretched amendment No. 202, which we may now discuss not on its merits but on the basis of relationship to the 1980 Act, could conceivably have been attached to section 17(2) of that Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any case where the Secretary of State is satisfied, upon representations made to him by the education authority of any education area, or by any church or denominational body acting on behalf of the parents of children belonging to such church or body, and after such inquiry as the Secretary of State deems necessary, that a new school is required for the accommodation of children whose parents are resident within that education area, regard being had to the religious belief of such parents"—</p></blockquote>
and so on. The whole clause is ill-conceived. We are not even sure whether it should be inserted into the 1980 Act exactly where the Minister seeks to insert it. It is incumbent on the Minister to justify his choice. This is the first opportunity we have had to argue that in seeking to amend the 1980 Act the Government have produced a clause so confused and miscellaneous, and whose purpose is so uncertain, that it could be inserted into the parent Act at at least two different points. We are not being mischievous to mention that the clause could follow section 30 or section 17(2). We do not want to go on at great length, but by slipping in those wide-ranging powers and tacking them on at the end of the proposals for school closures, the Minister has thoroughly confused the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the longer I speak the more confused the matter will become. I am not sure whether that is a condition in which I find myself or whether the Committee will be confused if hon Members try to follow my reasoning. Our objection to the clause as such is that it is two-faced. On the one hand, it seeks to give powers to local authorities, with the Minister abdicating responsibility, while, on the other, it seeks to impose a straitjacket on the local authorities in such a way as to make it difficult for them to plan the educational provision for children in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take it that it is not sufficient for local authorities to take the opportunity afforded by falling school rolls to close schools. We recognise that school rolls will not continue indefinitely to fall, that alternative provision will have to be made when the birth rate starts rising again, and that, in some instances, this time lag between the closure of a school and the opening of a new one is very short. Therefore, we hope that a far-sighted local authority which makes adequate provision both in terms of the children's education and in terms of meeting its own financial needs would over a time be able to phase its planning so that, as one school closed, another might need to open to meet the changing needs of its community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that this is perhaps most sharply focused in the context of the urban areas, where we see population movements, but parts of my constituency are at present undergoing fairly considerable development in private house building. Unfortunately, there is little in the way of public house building, owing to the activities of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>675</span>
Under-Secretary, the hon Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rif kind), but the private house developments which are continuing—although at not quite the pace that the property speculators and builders had hoped, owing to the mortgage rates, the economic recession and such difficulties—will result in a need for new schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas, we shall have schools surplus to requirements, and I do not think that the clause will help in any way. The Minister is taking powers unto himself which will not be of assistance either to the Department or to the local authorities. The clause seeks to interfere with the legitimate long-term objectives of local government planning in education provision, and it will result in confusion for the Minister and his advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it may matter precious little whether clause 6 ends up as additional subsections to section 30 or section 17. If I had had more time, I might well have been able to find other appropriate places to insert the clause, but I think that I have pointed to the considerable concern on these Benches about the nature of the powers that the Minister is taking unto himself and the effect that they will have on the planning that responsible local authorities are required to undertake if they are adequately to provide for the education of children, to meet the duties that parents require, and under section 17, to provide and maintain equipment in schools and other buildings. I realise that section 17 may be of a technical nature in terms of keeping the buildings in order, but the planning that is required for the funding of these activities is in no way assisted by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we shall vote against the clause not only for that reason but for the divisive and distressing effects which will come from the two different sets of provisions which will be available to various types of parents or religious communities when we close schools in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) referred to the use of the word "miscellaneous". I agree with him that when the word is used—and it is used constantly by the Government in various Bills—one's suspicions are aroused. If one looks at the composition of the Bill, one sees that from clause 6 to the end there is no other subdivision, so there are 16 clauses, all miscellaneous provisions, in the Bill. Before this Bill came into Committee there was the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, and this Bill would be better entitled Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer specifically to some of the points that have been brought to my attention by my hon Friend, and, in particular, to the draconian powers which the Secretary of State is giving to himself in 30B. When the Minister talked about his amendment, and I presume that we are discussing the clause as amended, he did not refer to this part of the clause. I hope he will give us some further information which is not clear, neither from the rubric to the clause nor from the explanatory and financial memorandum, from which I quote:

	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will be empowered also to prescribe categories of proposals which an authority must submit to him for his approval:"</p></blockquote>
Categories of proposals cover I know not what. My hon Friend says that this is so vague an expression as to be quite meaningless. It could cover everything, or it could cover a minimum, and one wants to know what the Government have in mind. They must have some proposals in mind which they will not approve, and some which they will approve. The explanatory memorandum is more concise in some ways than clause 30B, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority shall submit to the Secretary of State for his consent any proposal of theirs"—</p></blockquote>
not categories of proposals—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(of a prescribed kind) and shall not implement such a proposal without his consent."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister give us some examples of the proposals that a local education authority would put forward of which he would not approve? He must have discussed these matters with COSLA, and given it some idea of what was in his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon Friends have said, it is strange that at the time that the Government are chivvying us because we want the Secretary of State to keep certain powers, such as the final responsibility for a decision on the closure of a school, the Minister is saying "We do not want the local authorities to have this greater freedom." But here, when the reverse is the case, the Secretary of State is saying "I will not." Only he will decide, not the parents, not the local authority. If the Secretary of State decides to withhold his consent from any proposals put forward by the local authority, and I understand that there is no provision for appeal, he will at the same time be saying "But we are giving them freedom". To close schools? The unpopular buck is being passed to the local authority as regards school closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been the same all along the line for many months during the past year or two. The buck has been passed to the local authorities on rate increases, on rent increases, on the sacking of local authority employees and teachers. The Government have said, "The local authority is free to do all these things now." The same applies to assisted place schools. They say "Leave it all to the schools. We will have nothing to do with even the selection of pupils who will attend the schools. It will be a matter of supply and demand between two presumably willing partners, the parents and the school authorities. The Secretary of State wants nothing to do with it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the issue of denominational schools. The Minister said that the main purpose of the clause in this context was to satisfy the Roman Catholic hierarchy that they would be in no worse condition when the Bill was enacted than under the terms of the 1918 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the main purpose of the amendment, not the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that was the gist of his argument on the amendment, but it is the same for the clause. The Minister said that he went out of his way to satisfy the hierarchy that their position is not worsened in relation to the 1918 Act by virtue of the amendment. He asserted that we were virtually main

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>677</span>
taining the status quo as regards the hierarchy. But the comparative position is no longer the same, because the local authorities' position in relation to their non-denominational schools is worsened. The hierarchy still has preferential treatment by comparison with the situation that existed before the Bill. That is the argument that will be adduced in Scotland. There is a feeling, which will grow, that the Government have leaned over backwards for the Roman Catholic hierarchy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am neither a Roman Catholic nor a member of the Church of Scotland. I am an agnostic member of the Church of England. But I hold strongly to the view that in modern society there should not be room for schools that separate children on a religious basis. The Labour Party states firmly—the Minister may distort my remarks as he did the remarks of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—that schools ought to be integrated, and that it makes no sense in social or educational terms and is damaging for children if they are separated and taught from an early age that somehow they are different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that it will be a long process and will have to be done by persuasion and argument. We cannot impose it on people. They feel strongly about it. Therefore, to raise the matter in this way in the Bill is to exacerbate the situation and create divisions in Scotland which were there even before the Bill but which will become wider as a result of the inclusion of clause 6 and the incitement that these debates produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be assured that the matter will not rest there. I do not intend to take part in the sectarian war, but I hold my views strongly as an educationist who is interested in the education of children in all sections of the community. That has been the basic belief of my party and we stick to it. We greatly regret the inclusion of clause 6 in the Bill because it runs against the tide. That is why the Oppotion will vote against it, here and on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not heard the last of the clause. We shall return to it on Report, because Members who are not in the Committee have the right to say their piece on it on the Floor of the House, and we intend to give them the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) returned to the matter of denominational schools that we considered on the amendment and persisted in the suggestion that the purpose of the amendment is to give some advantage to denominational schools, and to Roman Catholic schools in particular. I must refute that suggestion. Anyone who studies the amendment objectively will disagree with the hon Member for Fife, Central because in the amendment we have sought to take into account the point that as the school population is falling and schools have to be closed as a result, the balance of denominational to non-denominational schools in Scotland will not suffer in so far as is practicable as a result of the school closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the provisions of the amendment apply to Church authorities of whatever denomination and allow them to appeal to the Secretary of State, not in respect of an individual school closure but in respect of any circumstance whereby the Church authorities believe that the balance of denominational to non
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>678</span>
denominational education is being deliberately reduced under the excuse, if I may use that word, of having to close schools because of the reduction in pupil numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I would like to make two points. First, will the Minister concede that the thrust of any concern about the amendment has to relate to the Catholic schools because they constitute the overwhelming majority of the denominational schools? Secondly, would the Minister care to be a little more specific about the ground for concern which has been expressed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy and tell us which particular local authorities have caused the Catholic community to be concerned about the balance of educational provision between denominational and non-denominational sectors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal with the hon Gentleman's first point, of course I agree that the preponderance of denominational education in Scotland is in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. That is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to his second point, following consultation with local authorities the Roman Catholic hierarchy did not point the finger at any particular local authority in Scotland, but in view of the school closures that undoubtedly will take place, and because of the 1918 Act and the commitment that that gives to denominational education, they considered that their rights would be better protected by an amendment of this nature. I do not believe that that was an unreasonable expectation on their part, especially as I had put to them that any protection for denominational education could not extend solely to Roman Catholics but had to be framed in such a way that it would protect any denomination. Although schools of other denominations are very much in the minority compared with Roman Catholic schools, the amendment would have to be framed in such a way that any denomination would have the right to make exactly the same objection. They agreed with that, which is why the amendment is framed in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about appeals that are made to the Secretary of State for Scotland about threatened school closures. If I have correctly understood the Minister, the argument is that the ratio would hast to be kept the same as far as is practicable. How will the smaller denominational schools—the Episcopalian and Jewish schools—be affected? For instance, there is only one Jewish school, so that cannot be closed because that would completely destroy the proportion of Jewish schools. Therefore, under the formula it would be impossible to close the Jewish school and very difficult to close any of the Episcopalian schools because that would completely throw out the formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are approximately 2,500 schools in Scotland, 20 per cent, of which would be Roman Catholic. If we are to retain that percentage, we shall get into deep water in individual cases. My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) was correct. All hell will break loose in that locality if it is seen that a Catholic school is kept and a non-Catholic school is not. The Secretary of State will reply "We have to keep a balance. There is already a smaller number in the Catholic area and, therefore, there is a balance to keep; it has to be seen that we are protecting that minority."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman provides an ingenious argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —in respect of this provision. However, he ignores one important factor, that the number of schools depends on the number of pupils. It is not enough to say that a school cannot be closed to maintain the balance of schools. The number of pupils cannot be ignored. If there are no pupils in a Jewish school, or if there is a sufficient reduction in the number of its pupils so that the school is not viable, it will have to be closed—just as Roman Catholic schools will be closed whether or not the Bill is passed—because the demand for that school will have decreased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Denominational educationists want to be assured— this is the purpose of the amendment which we debated for a couple of hours or so and its objectives are, or should be, well known to the Committee—that a local authority does not use falling school numbers as an excuse for eliminating denominational education. That is the difference. It is an argument for the denominations and for the principals in churches to take up with the education authorities, not an argument for parents to use in respect of the closure of a particular school. We have repeated that point many times in our discussions on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central made clear that he, like the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) does not believe in denominational education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor does the Labour Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor does the Labour Party. Again, we have the assurance that the Labour Party is opposed to denominational education. I do not object—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. The personal opinions of both the hon Gentlemen to whom I have referred are perfectly understandable. I do not dispute that. The fact that the Labour Party holds that view as an objective for party policy is another matter, but I shall not comment on that either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to both hon Gentlemen—I have suggested this to them in debates on many other parts of the Bill— that they must take into account what parents and their constituents want. Surely, what matters more than anything else is not what the Labour Party wants for the people of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor what you want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is what the people of Scotland want for themselves. That is the purpose of every aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Cathcart, who, on this occasion, was unusually supported by his Front Bench, expressed concern about section 30. The new sections referred to in the Bill are freestanding and do not form part of section 30. They go in part II of the 1980 Act because they relate to the functions of education authorities, and sections 30A and 30B are not restricted to denomi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>680</span>
national schools. However, as a matter of drafting, it is appropriate to put sections C and D with sections A and B as they relate to the same subject matter, namely, consultation and consent for changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this may be a little difficult because, as we have said many times, it is prepared in a way that will make consolidation with the 1980 Act simplified. When we look at the sections as they are arranged in the Bill, it does not always simplify the work of members of the Committee. I fully appreciate that. Nevertheless, if we look at the 1980 Act—I am glad to see that the hon Member for Cathcart has a copy—it makes the matter simpler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I repeat—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is always quick off the mark. Then, when he stands up after I have given way, I discover that he does not know what the heck has been going on and we have to explain it all to him again. It extends the consideration of any matter in the Bill—even discussing the time of day. So for the particular benefit of the hon Member for South Ayrshire I shall repeat that the new sections are freestanding and do not form part of section 30. They go in part II of the 1980 Act because they relate to the functions of education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat also that sections 30A and 30B are not restricted to denominational schools. This is fine. We are making progress. As a matter of drafting, however, sections 30C and 30D are appropriate to go with 30A and 30B as they relate to the same subject matter, namely, consultation and consent to changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister had listened to what I said earlier instead of getting embarrassed at arriving late, he would have known that that is exactly the point that I was making. I think that I made the point rather than my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). The point was that sections 30A and 30B are freestanding. Effectively they are 31 and 32, and they should be renumbered accordingly to be more sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that section 30B, when it becomes a new section in part II of the 1980 Act, will not just apply to school closures and will give the Secretary of State carte blanche to interfere with any decision of a local authority with which he happens to disagree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case, but it might be helpful to the hon Gentleman, who is newly appointed to the Committee, if I point out that clause 6—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Elected. Is the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) telling the Committee that the Opposition actually decided to have the hon Member for South Ayrshire and that he was not im-

posed on them? I find that difficult to believe. I thought more of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire before he apprised the Committee of that piece of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire was selected for the Committee by the Committee of Selection, the powers that be. It is a pity that there are not more powers of reselection or deselection so that the Minister, who has been incompetent throughout the Committee proceedings, could be deselected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, then, that the hon Member for South Ayrshire was inflicted on his colleagues as a result of the usual process of selection of hon Members for Committees. That makes the position more easily understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring the hon Member for South Ayrshire to the proposals for regulations, the consultative paper on sections 30A and 30B of the 1980 Act which was laid before the Committee before he was able to join us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) asked a number of questions about the powers of the Secretary of State and so on. May I refer him to the same document which has been available to the Committee for some time. It might help both hon Gentlemen to understand how this part of the Bill will operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us and we need not read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: School closures are inevitable because of the decline in the school population—a simple fact far beyond the understanding of the hon Member for South Ayrshire. Over the next three years, the school population in Scotland will decline by about 100,000 pupils, that is, by about 14 per cent, of the total. Inevitably, schools in Scotland will be closed as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be interested to know that the control of school closures has existed since 1872. It is a relic of the days when every detail of schooling, including class timetables, was controlled from the centre. If we were starting afresh, to impose such a control on education authorities would be unthinkable. It is completely out of keeping with the philosophy of the Royal Commission on Local Government, which concluded, in paragraph 1013, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the kinds of control exercised by central government have in total a damaging effect on the independence and initiative of local authorities."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who wrote this brief? Whoever it was and the one who is reading it out are completely ignorant of the history of Scottish education if it is implied that in 1982 decisions regarding the management, control, opening and closure of schools were taken by some mug in Edinburgh. Even at that time there was a decentralised system of school management through school boards and the like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

man by pressing the point, but I think he will find that the question of school closures has in fact been a matter for central control since 1872. As I say, that is completely out of keeping with the philosophy of the Royal Commission on Local Government. No similar control is exercised over local authorities today. If the hon Gentleman does not like the history, let me repeat that no similar control is exercised over local authorities today as regards other facilities such as clubs, children's homes or homes for the elderly, which are very important. I hope that the hon Gentleman agrees that homes for the elderly are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I know that my hon Friend agrees that they are important for the elderly. There is no similar control exercised over these closures, and in this Government's opinion it is important that education authorities should have freedom to manage their services without such detailed central Government controls. Local authorities decide when a new school is required in their area, and it is only right and proper that they should also decide, after proper consultation, when a closure is necessary. That is laid down in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
he freedom that we are attaching to local authorities carries with it responsibility, and it is important that the freedom that we are granting to education authorities should not deprive parents of the opportunity of a full and effective hearing of their views on the proposals. On Second Reading, the right hon Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) said that in his experience no Secretary of State of either party allowed a school to be closed without assuring himself that the parents had been properly consulted before authority was given. We are providing a statutory obligation on local authorities to consult parents and other interested bodies not only about closure proposals but about other proposals, and to have regard to any views expressed before they take a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the colleges of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon Members will note that the proposed new sections 30A and 30B enable the Secretary of State to prescribe the persons who are to be consulted, the proposals on which they shall be consulted, and the manner of the consultation. That is why I referred earlier to the consultation paper which has been made available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final point to make about the decision resting with education authorities. Some hon Members have suggested that education authorities, after the consultations have been carried out, will merely decide to proceed with their original proposals, effectively making the consultation a sham. I do not believe that education authorities will behave in that way—even the education authority of which the hon Member for South Ayrshire was formerly a member. On the contrary, I expect that local authorities will think deeply and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>683</span>
seriously before coming to what will be the final decision on a proposal to close a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I know from my own experience, having corresponded with hon Members on closeure proposals— a duty I always carry out every time a proposal recommendation is made to the Secretary of State—and also from having visited schools and spoken to parents about decisions affecting closures, these decisions are not taken lightly by the local authorities. Therefore, I do not expect local authorities to make these decisions lightly in the future, and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be brief and to avoid the gratuitous and personally offensive asides which the Minister has made the hallmark of his speeches this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two points. First, I wish to reiterate the position in regard to the Labour Party. We recognise that the existence of denominational and non-denominational schools in Scotland can sometimes be a source of aggravation in communities. The Labour Party does not intend to alter that system until such time as all parties concerned are prepared to give their free consent to such an alteration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, on the question of denominational schools, in the light of what has happened I feel that I should quote from a memorandum on the negotiations between the Government and the Scottish hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church on the new Education Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A fundamental principle in the negotiation of the 1918 agreement was the protection by central government. The Catholics of that day did not wish to be completely at the mercy of local government."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even in the present regional authority set-up, one case gives rise to fears. In one region a proposal was made for the closure of a Catholic secondary school and its absorption into two existing Catholic secondaries, leaving the two remaining schools with rolls at least 50 per cent, more than any non-denominational school in that region. Fortunately the proposal was abandoned, but if it had been pressed, the Church would have had no protection in the proposed new law."</p></blockquote>
The local authority in question was Tayside region, and the school in question was Lawside academy. Tayside region is a Conservative-controlled authority, which has been zealous in the extreme in pursuing the Government's policy of cuts. On the basis of that example, the Roman Catholic hierarchy sought to get what could be regarded by some people as privileged treatment because they could not trust certain Conservative-controlled authorities to recognise their responsibilities under the 1918 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy about the clause. Some of us have stronger misgivings than other about the amendment. By his gratuitously offensive asides directed at individual Members—their educational background, their service in local government and so on—the Minister has sought to make cheap political points, and the record must now be put straight. Had the Minister not sought to abdicate his responsibilities in respect of school closures, and had we not had a Conservative local authority seeking to discriminate against the Roman Catholic community in its area, this whole business would not have aroused
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>684</span>
the feelings that it has, and create even worse feelings in the country as time goes on. We have no part in that and we do not wish to inflame it in any way, but the position must be made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the 1872 Act, I have a copy of "Scotland's History of Scottish Education". While also listening to the Minister, I read a chapter of that. For his benefit— he is responsible for education in Scotland—I must explain that the book was written by the principal of Aberdeen college of education, James Scotland. It is not perhaps the best form of bedtime reading but it contains a fairly clear outline of the 1872 Act. I can find nothing it it to support his refutation of the argument of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has gone on longer than we expected and has raised some important points. Having read the Department's expanded details on clause 6—that is, the new regulations under proposed new subsections 30A and 30B—I am still at a loss to know why the clause should be in the Bill. It may be that we are somewhat bemused and befuddled, but I doubt that. Therefore we shall vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Roman Catholic parents and children in my constituency will be interested in the comments about the Tayside region school in Dundee. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) will be aware that there is a Roman Catholic school in Perth which caters for a wide area around the city. Children travel there from Blairgowrie and elsewhere; there is no question of that stopping. As a matter of policy, Tayside region allows parents to select the schools where they want their children to go. What is in the Bill will make other authorities do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be failing in my duty were I not to draw attention to the fact that Catholic parents in my constituency will be most interested in the comments of the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) about the Labour Party's attitude to the future of these schools. The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was not in the Committee at the time. I found them extremely disturbing.

In a modern society there must be room for choice and for those who wish their children to receive training in the teachings of their Church—and of different Churches. I am sad that more Scottish schools do not take Church teachings more seriously. One of the things for which Roman Catholic schools can be commended—certainly, this applies to those in my constituency—is that they ensure that the children understand the teachings of their Church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon Gentleman's remarks a little hypocritical, to say the least. When he talks of Catholic education in his area, he should remember that the former Tory-controlled Perth county council's provision was so inadequate that many children had to

travel outside the county—to St. Modan's high school in Stirling, for example—to receive a decent education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be held accountable for what happened in the past. All I can say is that the Roman Catholic school in Perth knows that I care about its problems as, indeed, I care about the problems of other school's problems in the constituency. I commend it for what it does. I want that to be put on record. It is a good school and does a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that gave me concern—the criticism of Tayside region. I believe that that was unjustified, because Tayside Region carries out the policy of choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two resolutions that were passed on this matter at the Labour Party conferences—the sense of which was clear and exactly as we have explained it, although the Minister has tried on each occasion to distort what the resolutions said—were both passed at conferences held in the hon Gentleman's constituency, in the town of Perth, where members of the Labour Party from the Perth and East Perthshire branch act as stewards and do much of the organisational work. If they were not aware of those resolutions I should be surprised. I do not think that that is a valid point for the hon Gentleman to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a great deal from the Minister about his wish to move away from control of education by the Secretary of State and to hand it down to the local authorities, and to move away from 1872, where they used to lay down a dictum. I must marginally disagree with my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) on that matter. I have seen documents which actually laid down how drawing should be done. They were headed in those days—it would have been much more relevant with this Minister—"Scotch Office" and not "Scottish Office". It laid down exactly how one should draw, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we have moved a long way since then. But one problem that has been created for the Minister in this clause is that one part of central control over the curriculum—I know that this will not please all my hon Friends—is that religious instruction must be taught in every school in Scotland. That is still central control. If the Minister were serious about decentralising to local authorities, he would give them the right to decide whether there should be religious education in schools, as they have the right to decide whether there shall be English, maths, science, football or any other subject under the sun in any school. If the Minister is serious, why does he not pass that decision down? If he did that, many of the problems that he has had with the clause would be removed. The local authority could take its own decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think—whatever I may believe about it— that a single local authority in Scotland would take a different decision on that matter at present from that which the Minister would take. But he is not prepared to go the whole hog and put down to local authorities that decision on religious education. Why not? It would be the logical thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must point out that the Secretary of State still controls much of the curriculum indirectly, through the examination boards. That is a matter that we shall discuss under clause 13. That is how it is controlled
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>686</span>
centrally. It is not up to local authorities to decide what is taught in years three and four of the secondary schools in particular. It is controlled by the examination boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play of how the Roman Catholics are entitled to have their education as they wish. I accept that. That is the law at present. But must one, as a result, keep Roman Catholic schools and close down non-denominational schools in order to provide them? I do not see—I hope that Roman Catholics will listen seriously to this—why, with declining school rolls, one cannot have within one school what would be two essentially separate organisations, one Catholic and one non-denominational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that there is no Catholic way of teaching many subjects affected by a desperate shortage of teachers, such as mathematics, physics and other science subjects. Surely for practical subjects that do not require a Roman Catholic point of view to be put across the two organisations could have the same teachers. That would save tremendously on staff costs. In other areas where there may be problems, such as literature, history and religious education, there could be separate teachers, either under the same headmaster or under separate headmasters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply throw that out as an idea for the Minister to consider. I should not have thought that it was an impossible concept. The children would then have shared facilities, and we could begin to break down an idea to which many of us object—the idea that children who have played together in the same street until the age of 5 should suddenly be sent to different schools and realise for the first time in their lives that they are different from the kids with whom they have been playing happily for years. If my idea were adopted children would be mixing, playing together and sharing classes in certain subjects. That would begin to break down the process of segregation which many of us believe is damaging to the social life of Scotland, and which has resulted from generations of keeping children of different religions apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon Friend, I do not so much mind the Minister's gratuitous personal insults. I have grown used to them by now—they are like water off a duck's back. I first heard them when, as an ordinary Back Bencher, he used to petition the Lothian authority about this and that. I recognise his past frustrations and accept that he wishes to settle old scores. However, I do mind when the hon Gentleman does not answer any of the substantial arguments advanced in a debate but reads instead a prepared text at variance with the whole tenor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>687</span>
of the debate. That is insulting to members of the Committee who have taken time to consider and explain their arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat those arguments. However, I put it to the Minister in all seriousness that, despite all his general remarks about freedom of choice, freedom for local authorities, getting away from the power of central control and so on, he has not answered our questions about new section 30B. That is totally at variance with what he said in his speech. May I ask him again one simple question? Does that provision apply only to school closures? If so, where is that limitation specified? If it is not so, am I right in saying that because the clause is to be inserted under that heading, standing, as the Minister rightly said, as a new clause on its own without reference to other preceding or subsequent clauses, it applies to a wider range of matters than school closures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right, does the Minister realise the full implications? I asked that question earlier, but in reply the Minister read a prepared text that did not refer to the matter. I am sure that the Committee would be better served and would make far better progress if there were some response to hon Members' arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of a reply to the debate by the Minister, I shall supply one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to make it easier for schools to be closed. It is clear that the Government wish to wash their hands of that matter and to pass the buck so that they can blame local education authorities when school closures are proposed. The Minister tries to justify the measure by saying that he is giving freedom to local authorities, but that does not ring true coming from a Government who are at the same time forcing local authorities to sell their council houses. They will now be bringing extra pressure to bear on education authorities in order to close schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although much of the debate has centred around denominational schools there is a particular category of schools which is very much at risk. When Conservative Members come to vote on clause stand part I hope that they will bear in mind that many of them represent areas in which there are rural schools that are now at risk and will be put at further risk by the clause. I do not believe that either the Minister or the Whip have any rural schools in their constituencies, but why should the Edinburghers try to dictate to their hon Friends in the Committee who, like me, represent constituencies in which there are many rural schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) must have many rural schools in his constituency. The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), who is sleeping or reading just now, is apparently uninterested in the fact that his Government are making it easier for the education authorities in his constituency to close rural schools. The hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) has many rural schools in his patch and he is not even present for the debate, nor is the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). The other Minister, the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), is present and he, too, must have many rural schools in his constituency. We must remember that those rural schools are not just schools but the lifeblood of the community
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>688</span>
in many rural areas and it would be a tragedy in many instances if they were to close. The clause will make it easier to close schools in the constituencies that I mentioned which are represented by Tory Members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if local education authorities come forward with proposals to close schools it will be pointless for those hon Gentlemen to get up petitions and come bleating to the Secretary of State because he will just turn round and tell them "It is nothing at all to do with me because under section 6 of the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Act 1981"—as the Bill will become—"I do not have any power to intervene and you voted for that particular clause."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I think in fairness that it should be mentioned that tucked away at the back of the document we have referred to, hidden in the last page, almost beyond sight, there is a passing reference to rural schools, included as an afterthought, such is the significance that the Minister places on the matter. He says that he will prescribe that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority shall submit for his consent any proposal relating to the closure of schools."</p></blockquote>
I can appreciate why my hon Friend almost missed that point because I almost missed it myself. It is hidden away at the end as though the Minister were ashamed to do something decent in the legislation. If the Minister had any real heart in the job he was doing he would have put it on the front page because it is one of the few decent parts of the section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon Friend for his intervention. The fact that there is only a fleeting reference shows the low priority that the Government give to the excellent education carried out in many of the rural schools in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am just winding up, but as the hon Gentleman gave way to me I shall give way, but that will be for the last time. I am winding up instead of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank the hon Gentleman for giving way. I should like the hon Gentleman to acknowledge that the rural schools are in rural areas which have rural councillors who, in the main, are Tories. I am very happy to leave the decisions to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That remains to be seen. For example, in the case of the hon Member for Argyll, part of his constituency comes under Strathclyde education authority which is Labour-controlled. I put a great deal of faith in the ability of Labour-controlled councils, to look after the needs of children in rural as well as urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Come what may, if any school closure proposal is brought forward in Perth and East Perthshire after the Bill arrives on the statute book, the hon Member will be wasting his time taking delegations or presenting petitions to the Secretary of State or the Minister, because the Minister will say that it is none of his business. He will remind the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire that he voted for clause 6.

I am glad to see that now we have the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East back in the Committee Room, because the hon Gentleman has shown himself to be particularly rebellious. I use the word in the good sense here, in respect of the needs of rural people and petrol pricing. He rebelled against his own Government—and I applaud him for doing that—to vote for the interests of the people in his constituency. I hope that he repeats that performance on this matter, because clause 6 could be turned into just as big an attack on cultural and educational standards in rural areas as the petrol price increase is on transport services in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East to let us see his rebellious instincts coming out again on this issue, and to vote with the Opposition. We have a Government now who are hell-bent on closing down many institutions in Scotland that have given a great educational service to many people. We have seen the way in which they are trying to sledgehammer through the closing down of the colleges of education. This clause is an attempt to facilitate the closure of schools. I think that all reasonable people on both sides of the Committee should vote against clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The answer to his question about denominational schools will be self-evident even to him.

The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) raised the matter of rural schools. We know that the hon Gentleman was busy in Hong Kong last week, doing we know not what. We shall not ask what he was doing, as it might be too embarrassing. Knowing the hon Gentleman's natural modesty, had it been anything worthwhile he would have told us, anyway.

	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 33, fine 7, leave out from "body" to "that" in line 9.This is a probing amendment. I am curious, because it appears that the parliamentary draftsmen have not seen fit to make the Bill consistent. I realise that much energy was expended on getting amendment No. 202 into acceptable shape but, having done so, we now have a reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any denominational body acting on behalf of the parents of children belonging to such church or body".</p></blockquote>
I imagine that those words will now be deleted in the light of the fact that, as far as the Roman Catholic Church is concerned, the body that is used for consulting will be the hierarchy and not what is referred to in new subsection (2). Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment would be to restrict an education authority's power to provide a new denominational school for its area to a situation where the authority had received representations from any Church or denominational body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman, in tabling the amendment, may not have appreciated that the wording of the new subsection that he is proposing to amend is identical with the present statutory provision in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, except that the Secretary of State is removed from the role of determining whether a new denominational school is required in a particular area. That now becomes the role of the education authority. In view of the debate that we have just finished, that is reasonable and logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection, therefore, as it appears in the Bill, puts into effect our policy to relax controls over local authorities by dispensing with the Secretary of State's overall control of matters that are properly the concern of education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to go against the grain of amendment No. 202, which suggests that, when local authorities are closing down denominational schools, the Secretary of State has to accept a request for a review by the Roman Catholic hierarchy. We suggest that, before Report, the Minister should look at the matter again and tidy it up. It seems that, when a religious community wants to prevent a school being closed, it uses the medium of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, but when it wants one opened it does not use that medium and goes only as far as the appropriate local authority; it does not have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State if there is a dispute about what the Minister called the balance between denominational and non-denominational schools.

I shall not press the amendment to a vote. I put it on record and ask the Minister to look at it again and consider tidying up the wording before Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief point about the definition of the phrase "denominational body". Section 135 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 lists all the definitions that are used in that Act such as "child", "clothing", "college of education"—there will not be many of those left after this Government— "dental examination", "dental inspection", and so on. I looked for a definition of "denominational body" between "college of education" and "dental examination".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the word "denominational" may have a specific meaning in the context of our ordinary speech, it may have a much wider meaning in the Oxford Dictionary. Under the terms of that dictionary it might have a much wider meaning so that even the Labour Party could be called a denominational body. If that were so, we could insist that the local authority should provide a school for the children of all Labour Party Members. That is an excellent idea. Perhaps we should refer to the matter in that comprehensive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be a comprehensive school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) said that it would not be a comprehensive school, but it would be very comprehensive. The level of ability might be considerably higher if the Conservative Party asked for its denominational school as well, although I am sure that the level of ability in our school would be even higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, without being too frivolous, I want the Minister to tell us what he means by a "denominational body". If his meaning is exact, we should examine it. What sort of body would represent the Catholic Church and its hierarchy? I do not know enough about the structure of the Roman Catholic Church to know how the denominational body would relate to the Church, or what form it might take and on what levels. Therefore, I should like the Minister to bring forward a definition which could be inserted into section 135 of the 1980 Act so that we can be clear about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is a recognised charitable religious organisation.

Therefore, the Minister is under some obligation to define the term and to put it into the interpretation section of the 1980 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment, so I do not expect a lengthy debate about it. Unfortunately, my expectations are not being fulfilled this evening. The amendment concerns the restriction and abolition of educational schemes. It seeks to apply some sort of timescale to the clause, because educational schemes should be seen to be working within a period of time. We have specified a period of five years because we felt that it would be helpful to hear from the Minister how long such schemes would last and whether they would be made for one year, restricted, and abolished the next year.

Somehow it is implied that there is merely a grouping of parents to provide education for their children at no expense to the State or local authority and therefore we, representing the public interest, have no concern with those allegedly independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing could be further from the truth. Undoubtedly, and unfortunately, the Bill will become law—at least for a short time—because of the Government's majority. Many of the schools are receiving public money, as my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) pointed out. For that reason there should be a greater degree of public accountability with regard to independent schools.
