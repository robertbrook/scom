	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Gourlay, and the permission of the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) I wish to correct the record in respect of the Minister's constant jibes about a late-comer to the Committee. Only at the end of last week was I aware that my presence was required in this Committee. You may have heard that last Thursday the hon Member for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Discussion of an hon Member's presence in Committee has nothing to do with schedule 4. As I understood the Minister this morning, he made it clear that he referred to the hon Member's absence in the earlier part of the morning. No doubt the hon Member had legitimate reasons for not being in Committee, but that is not a matter for discussion here. It has been made perfectly clear on the record that the hon Member is quite within his rights. I should prefer him not to pursue the matter at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: ask for your courtesy, Mr. Gourlay. The Minister, in his rather robust performance this morning, used the word late-comer many times. I wish it to be made clear that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) objected even to my legitimate presence last Thursday and created much aggravation, which I did not pursue, but could have done. Today, I was meant to be on other business which I arranged before being appointed to this Committee. I got up at 5 o'clock this morning to try to get here on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if the Minister is unable, for whatever reason, to attend the Committee in the future—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—he might find us to be a little more tolerant and understanding than he has been. That would not be difficult. However, I am grateful to you for your courtesy, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister made some snide remarks in this debate. That was the whole tenor of his contribution this morning. I hope that he has had a good lunch so that there is a little more good will this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
I believe that the Minister used the phrase "Dial a quote". He implied that I and my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) were somehow wrong in making comments to the newspapers. Surely, we would be open to accusations, questions or attacks if we kept our views quiet, if the electorate was not aware of them and if we were trying to keep something secret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that this Minister, of all Ministers, would have kept quiet about talking to, or releasing speeches to, the press, particularly in the light of his disgraceful speech in Girvan which was the only one to cast aspersions on the future of Stonefield Vehicles. He would rather—and ought to—forget about that and not talk about making comments to the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also snidely remarked that the Opposition had not put forward any constructive alternative to the assisted-places scheme. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have said frequently—we shall repeat it again and again—that the money going into the assisted-places scheme would be better spent on public education, for which the Minister ought to have responsibility but to which he gives scant attention. I should like to see not merely the Minister but members of his Department paying attention to the local authority system of education rather than to the private education system. That is a constructive alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our schools, for which the Minister is supposed to be responsible, are being starved of resources in every direction. The number of teachers is being severely cut back; teachers are on the dole—trained teachers are being thrown on the dole by this Minister. Supplies in every area of equipment, including textbooks, and all the arrangements for local authority schools are being severely cut back. The constructive alternative that we suggest is that the money should be put into those needs rather than into the assisted places scheme. Let that never be forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that we should stop telling parents and start asking them. We did ask parents at the last general election. Parents and others in Scotland decisively rejected the Conservative party. The people of Scotland certainly did not support Conservative party policy. The Conservatives have no mandate whatsoever for their assisted places scheme. It is being forced on an unwilling public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon Gentleman consulted his colleagues from the north of England? He might get a slightly different view of the matter. Secondly, I wonder whether he is really advocating that the United Kingdom should be split up into different parts, with different Governments depending on who was elected in the different areas. I can tell him that in the rural areas of Scotland the Labour Party would not have much say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Discussion is on the Question, That the schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill. It will be on the merits of the schedule and not on the question which party will be in Government next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: agree with you, Mr. Gourlay. The statements made by the hon Member for Argyll are, as usual, irrelevant. My colleagues in the north of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
England are as opposed to the assisted-places scheme, as I am, but they also recognise that there is a separate education system in Scotland and that the Scottish people decisively rejected the Tories and thereby decisively rejected the assisted-places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:And the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and his lackeys—his yobbos behind him—also said that we could consult our own constituents about this matter. Certainly none of my constituents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it proper for the hon Member to describe other hon Members as yobbos?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I am aware, according to "Erskine May" it is not listed as an unparliamentary expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only in order, Mr. Gourlay, it is a perfectly apt, correct and precise description, particularly in regard to their conduct during the last few minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too mild a description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can say with confidence that few, if any, of my constituents would welcome the assisted-places scheme. It is an Edinburgh-dominated scheme—the brain-child of the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher). It will be known as Fletcher's folly for a long time, because it will be a folly. I am sure that, with hindsight, it will be seen as a silly scheme and will last only for a few years, until we take control again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also made a slighting remark about the anonymous letter that he received from West Stirlingshire. I receive not just one but many letters from the constituency of the Secretary of State for Scotland. People write to me, first, because they have come to the view that they do not have a Member of Parliament—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Do I understand that the newspaper being passed round is something to do with the Bill before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Russell Fairgrieve)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indirectly, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be directly concerned before it is in order to use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This conduct makes me come round to the view that my hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) is right. I should have used a stronger word for the attitude taken by Conservative hon Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I receive many letters from the citizens of Ayr, saying that they do not have a Member of Parliament who truly represents their interests. I am sure that they would be grateful to have an MP like my hon
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for a member of the Committee, or if it is in order, is it not a discourtesy from one hon Member to another hon Member, to mount a personal attack, in this case on my right hon Friend? The normal courtesy of the House is to notify another Member of Parliament if a personal criticism is to be made, and the correct place to do this, therefore, would be on the Floor of the House of Commons and not in the Committee, because my right hon Friend is not a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that every member of the Committee is well aware of the courtesies and usages of the House. While I cannot rule the hon Gentleman's remark out of order, it would be better that hon Members should observe the usual courtesies, and when an hon Member wishes to make an attack on another hon Member, he should give due notice. It is all right to make reference to the Secretary of State, but there is a limit to what one can say in the absence of the Minister concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister gave that sort of notice in that sort of way to my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire when he was not present in the Committee. The Minister made a far more stinging attack on my hon Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the Committee, I hope that the hon Gentleman will confirm that he passes these letters on to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I pass them on regularly to the Secretary of State for Scotland, just as I would pass on any letters from Galloway to the hon Member for Galloway, even if they came from Stranraer, where I was with the hon Gentleman on Friday, and had the pleasure of seeing him booed in his own constituency, because he is failing to represent the interests of his constituents. And because, unlike the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), he did not have the courage to vote against the 20p increase in the duty on petrol. I can tell the hon Member for South Angus that I have less to worry about in respect of my predecessor than he has in his area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed, as usual, in his self-justification, his pathetic attempt at justifying this assisted-places scheme. It will have a faltering life and a short one. I hope that it will be confined to the dustbin of history as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak briefly on the assisted-places scheme, because I must declare that I personally am not one of the ardent supporters of such schemes. I feel that they cater for a minority. But I believe that it ill becomes Opposition Members, who constantly remind us that they are defending the interests of minorities, to make speeches of the type that we have listened to, because if a few working-class children obtain true benefits from the scheme, I judge that the scheme will have been worthwhile. I believe, and I repeat what I said earlier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon Gentleman tell us what benefits he thinks children will obtain from going to a private school rather than their own local authority school in Perth or another part of East Perthshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: shall be delighted to do so. I thought that I made it clear in an earlier speech, that if one of my daughters was fortunate enough to be allocated one of the places at the school—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. We have heard the story before from the hon Member. Surely this is boring and repetitious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that I indicated to the Committee earlier this morning that we were somewhat removed from the principle of the assisted-places scheme. While the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) made a reference in general terms, I hope that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) will not pursue the matter too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely answering the intervention, Mr. Gourlay. I am not one of those who object to the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) rising to speak, because I always find him interesting and entertaining. That is very worth while in this Committee, in which we have been exposed to so many long, repetitious and boring speeches that made little sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again that if some working-class children from my constituency obtain benefits, I shall be delighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSULTATION ON, AND CONSENT FOR, CHANGES IN CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL MATTERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 196, in page 31, line 16, leave out "for the time being in force".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 197.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, Mr. Gourlay, I should like to suggest to the Committee that in all the amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
tabled under clause 6, amendment No. 202 only is of significance, as the other amendments are consequential to it. Therefore, it might be helpful to the Committee if I moved amendments Nos. 196, 198 and 201 formally, and then we debated the question on amendment No. 202.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: do not agree, Mr. Gourlay. You have selected amendments Nos. 196 and 197. Presumably, they could be taken formally, but the others you have deliberately selected for separate debate, and I propose that we stick to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee does not agree to the Minister's suggestion, I am bound to accept the provisional selection. I take it that the hon Gentleman is now moving amendment No. 196.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already moved amendment No. 196, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We require some explanation. Presumably the Government thought fit to introduce these words originally. Why the change of mind? Why this continuous sloppy draftsmanship? This is happening repeatedly, with the Government coming forward with amendments like this and saying that they are purely drafting amendments. It is a reflection on Ministers and their advisers. We cannot allow these things to go through on the nod, and we must protest at this kind of sloppiness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not sloppy drafting. I have explained that it is a consequential amendment, and the explanation sought by the hon Gentleman will be available when we reach amendment No. 202.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the Minister not say originally that we would receive the explanation later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This amendment is also consequential on amendment No. 202, but I should point out that subsection (3) is being strengthened by the amendment. The first part of the subsection will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall not grant consent under this section unless he is satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made".</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 199 and 200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I now come to the substance of the amendments, which I mentioned in my opening remarks. I remind the Committee that on Second Reading my right hon Friend the Secretary Of State said that we would table an amendment which would give a right of appeal to the Secretary of State in any case where a proposal relating to a denominational school would materially worsen the position of such schools in comparison with other schools. The amendment honours that undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make the Government's position on denominational schools quite plain. We have said on different occasions that we have no intention of altering the balance achieved by the 1918 Act and certainly have no plans to end the existence of separate denominational schools. What the Bill does is to repeal many of the controls exercised by the Secretary of State over non-denominational and denominational schools alike. Instead, there will be new provisions requiring education authorities to undertake consultations with parents and other prescribed persons before they can implement any change of a prescribed kind in their educational arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain proposals will also continue to need the Secretary of State's approval, and these will include, under new section 30C, any proposal to close a denominational school, which will mean that the pupils who attend that school will have to go instead to a non-denominational school. Those were the words that I read to the Committee in respect of amendment No. 198, when I said that they strengthened subsection (3) on page 32 of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some public misinterpretation of the amendment. It has been suggested—not, I am glad to say, by members of this Committee—that in some way the amendment would give Roman Catholic parents a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, whereas non-Catholic parents would not have such a right, that, where two schools side by side were to be closed, the Catholic parents would be able to appeal to my right hon Friend where the other parents would not. I hope that hon Members will agree that the terms of the amendment make it absolutely clear that that impression is untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Roman Catholic parents will not have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. The position of Roman Catholics or any other group of denominational parents will be no different from that of non-denominational parents and, in the type of case that I have just quoted, where denominational provision and non-denominational provision were being reviewed together, there would clearly be no reason to claim that there had been discrimination or that the balance was being disturbed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to give any person authorised by a church or denominational body the right to refer to the Secretary of State any proposal by an education authority relating to a school of his denomination where he considers that the proposal would result in a significant deterioration in the position of those schools compared with that of other schools managed by the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any such reference is unlikely to be made lightly. The denominational body making the reference and the authority must, under the terms of the amendment, have held discussions and failed to reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
To invoke the appeal to the Secretary of State at this stage is a significant step, indicating in effect a breakdown in relations between the education authority and the denominational body. After the reference is made, the Secretary of State has to satisfy himself that negotiations have broken down. If he is not so satisfied, the authority and the denomination must continue their discussions. He must also satisfy himself that the claim was justified, in that the proposal would lead to a significant worsening in the relative position of the denominational schools concerned. If he is so satisfied he will examine the proposal, and if he decides to approve it may impose conditions as regards the religious instruction of any children who will no longer receive their education in a denominational school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to underline that only persons authorised by a denominational body can appeal to the Secretary of State. Parents cannot do so. That must be understood by all who are interested in this part of the Bill, especially hon Members who may wish to explain it to their constituents over the weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a reference could not be made lightly. The amendment retains, in the new situation produced by the relaxation of controls, the essence of the balance of denominational and non-denominational education that exists in Scotland today. I invite the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are not happy about the amendment. We recognise that the Government have created conditions that have obliged them to enter into lengthy discussions with interest groups. They recognise that they might be thought to have endangered the position that the Catholic Church, at least, has enjoyed under the 1918 Act, so they have sought to go some way to allay the misgivings of the Catholic Church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken a difficult route that will cause fears and misgivings to be expressed by people in Scotland. We were prepared to accept a continuation of the status quo, and we are somewhat suspicious, to say the least, about the motives behind the clause per se. That will be examined when we debate clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is being disingenuous in suggesting that people could misinterpret the amendment by assuming that Roman Catholic parents would be in a privileged position compared with non-Roman Catholic parents, or indeed any parents with children at non-denominational schools. The distinction between the Scottish hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church and the parents of Roman Catholic children is rather a fine one, which will not be easily made by those who seek to misinterpret the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy about the amendment. We would have preferred the status quo to have been maintained. Some Opposition hon Members will not vote for the amendment! We recognise that it goes some way towards meeting the misgivings expressed by some people in Scotland. We know that there have been lengthy discussions which have continued over many months and that there have been more than 40 meetings of the Catholic education committee. Some of those meetings have taken place between the representatives of St. Andrew's House, the Catholic education committee and even between the Secretary of State, the Minister and the bishops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that that was a compromise in many respects which should never have happened in the sense that in the consultations surrounding the closures of schools we do not believe that the rights of people should ever be denied. We believe that the number of instances in which the right of appeal to the Secretary of State is applied does not impose an undue burden on the Secretary of State, nor has it been against the best interests of those who have sought to appeal or even those education authorities which had decisions overturned. We recognise that in some instances the motive behind the attempt to reach a compromise was due to the fear in some areas of the country that denominational education could have been undermined by local authorities which did not fully appreciate or sympathise with the implications of the 1980 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister several questions before I conclude. First, how many references on closures have there been since 1977? I ask that question in respect of both non-denominational and denominational schools. Secondly, how many denominational schools are there in Scotland? Thirdly, how many non-Roman Catholic denominational schools are there in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, to say that it is simply a matter of negotiation between religious leaders and not parents is open to misinterpretation by people in some parts of the country simply because they do not distinguish between the leaders and the flock, as it were. To lump together all the non-denominational schools again is somewhat ingenuous because we believe that the non-Roman Catholic denominational schools are a small minority of the schools which are affected. I would give a figure but rather than mislead the Committee I shall wait for the Minister to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy about the amendment. We perceive that it could cause difficulties, largely, we accept, through misinterpretation. Nevertheless, we feel that the course of action which the Minister would be best advised to take would be to withdraw the amendment and this clause once and for all and simply to retain the status quo. I wish to make perfectly clear that the Opposition will not support the amendment. We are not in favour of the amendment and shall not be voting for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the substance of what was said by my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). The clause has implications which may be misunderstood in Scotland and it would be unfortunate if we were to create tensions where none exist. We strongly believe in the maintenance of the status quo. When school closures are pending, irrespective of any religious considerations the authority concerned should have the automatic right to appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), who is a Roman Catholic, very courageously said that he objected to this discrimination in favour of his own church. I support him. There is no good reason why we should not preserve the status quo, and that means that we should not just abstain on the amendment but we should oppose it and the clause. That is what some of my hon Friends and I intend to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were to accept the status quo, although I doubt whether he will, we would not have to go through all these convolutions with regard to denominational schools. This is a long and convoluted clause which contains a major flaw. Surely it would have been sensible in the light of representations that were made from all quarters to say, "We understand that there are special problems with regard to denominational schools, but the spirit and principle of the 1980 Act has to be upheld."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also admit that there have been representations from non-demoninational schools. I hate the terms "denominational" and "non-denominational". There is nothing different about the buildings. "Non-denominational" is most inadequate to describe the ordinary local authority comprehensive school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister and the SED have received representations regarding those schools also, so surely it would have saved his going through all these convolutions if he had said, "In the light of these representations, we will maintain the status quo." That would have meant that the position of Roman Catholic schools was protected and that parents of children at other schools had the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangements for appeals tend to be somewhat long and protracted, and I know that the Minister may have worries about that, as I do. But there are other possibilities. There could be a change from the present position to a much more streamlined procedure, so that there would still be the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 202 is very complicated and has serious implications. 1 hope that this is not an irrelevant point to make. I have just dealt with a three-page letter from a lawyer about a constituent of mine who has fallen foul of the Rent Acts. Rent Acts are complicated legislation. In passing them, I am sure that our predecessors—no doubt there are hon Members present who were also involved—did not realise its full implications. I am worried about passing something as long and complicated as amendment No. 202 without very careful thought. I mean no disrespect to the SED and the draftsmen who drew it up. I am sure that they did their best. But I suspect that it has more implications than were at first realised. I am not on this occasion attacking the Minister. I have had enough of that as I am sure he has. I hope that he will consider this matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to table an amendment to clause 8 relating to schemes. Under present legislation, local authorities have to put forward schemes of education. In those schemes, which are very detailed, the transfer arrangements from primary to secondary school have to be specified, as does the nature of each school, whether denominational or non-denominational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy for a local authority to redesignate schools as non-denominational if the schemes did not have to go before the Secretary of State. It could also move pupils around if it were necessary, although with falling rolls that may not be necessary. I see this as a major flaw, because where the Secretary of State has, rightly, relaxed his control over education authorities, the nature of a school could be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, there is nothing specific to identify a denominational school, apart of course from its
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
pupils, its teachers and the arrangements that it makes, and so on. But there is nothing in the building to give that identification. It would be possible for an education authority to change the scheme and to get round the arrangements with regard to closure by that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is something that has occurred to me on the spur of the moment; and I have been recruited at late notice. Given time, I am sure that I could find many more flaws in what is being suggested. The proposal is inherently awkward and incorrect. There is no smoothness or neatness about it. It seems wrong and difficult to administer, and it is hard to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am being unfair, but it seemed that when reading his brief the Minister stumbled over some of the explanations. Even if his officials can find an answer to the point that I have raised, how many other flaws could be found not just by my colleagues and myself but by those in education who have not been involved in drawing up the amendment and who have not had time to consider the implications? I do not blame the Minister. He has taken a genuine expression of concern from representatives of the different denominations and tried to find a form of words to meet that. But would it not be much more sensible, simple and precise for the Minister to say "In the light of all the representations—not just those from the denominations—I shall maintain the status quo."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to my colleagues who served valiantly in the Committee before I came here and they tell me that the Minister has conceded very little on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friends the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) and Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), whose word I take implicitly, say that nothing has been conceded. This is an opportunity for the Minister to make some concession. It is not a matter of doctrine or dogma, such as the assisted-places scheme and freedom of choice—or parents' charter, as it is called—in local authority schools, or something of major division between the parties, but one that concerns the scheme's practical operation. The Minister will not be thought any the less of it he says "Sensible arguments have been put forward, not just by the Opposition but by people outwith the Committee, and I shall give way to them". Indeed, his stature will rise immeasurably, and we could all do with a little rise in stature. I hope that the Minister will see the sense of the argument, be able to take the initiative, and tell us that even if a decision cannot be taken today he will take account of what we are saying on behalf of people outside the House and give further consideration to adhering to the status quo. That will allow the denominational and other representations to be met without the need for this convoluted clause. Now is the opportunity for the Minister to show us that deep down—under that exterior which we have grown to love to hate—a heart is beating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know, Mr. Gourlay, that I do not have a suspicious nature, but on reading the clause my senses were alerted. I am very suspicious of what it seeks to do, and having listened to the Minister, I must say that my suspicions have not been allayed one iota, because I feel that he was somewhat uncomfortable when he read his explanation of this very long clause. The amendment takes up 52 lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is nothing to be suspicious of and the matter is as simple as the Minister would have us believe, why is it necessary to expand the amendment to 52 lines so that we should understand what it is all about? I suspect that it is not as the Minister has said. In his statement he tried to ignore the difficulties that I see not only in the amendment but in the clause. He tried to divert our attention to the fact that Catholic parents would not have the right of appeal, that they therefore would not be any different from non-denominational parents, and that the hierarchy of a denominational body would make the appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland. But on whose behalf would that denominational body be making the appeal? It would be for the parents, because they would immediately go to the denominational body as soon as they heard of the closure. Who would be making the appeal then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend accept—this is a question that I hoped to put the Minister later as it is one of the aspects of the clause that worries me—that a case can be argued here? Roman Catholic parents might be disadvantaged compared with non-denominational parents if they agreed with the local authority that a school should close, but the hierachy said that it should not, because they would be overruled. It may not be very likely, but there is a chance that that could happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: take my hon Friend's point. Of course, people could be disadvantaged to that extent, but I should think that they would be a minority. I certainly do not disagree that Catholic parents have a right to decide on their children's education and school. I imagine that they would very quickly make representations to whichever denominational body they thought could stop that school's closure. But that is not the kernel of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another example of the Secretary of State for Scotland washing his hands of the unsavoury responsibility for closing schools because he does not want to be seen to be doing it. Therefore, he is passing the responsibility down in a form of mock devolution to regional authorities. Those bodies which made representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland are absolutely correct to be afraid of school closures. They will be in areas such as Tayside. The backswoodsmen in Tayside regional authorities will have no compunction about closing schools—Catholic or non-denominational. Those authorities have shown that to be the case in the past. Tayside House, where those decisions are taken, is known locally as the educational abattoir. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
an astronomer's black hole. All the petitions, suggestions and heart rending pleas from parents go into this big abattoir, this black hole, and disappear, never to be heard of again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the principle that any group should have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland on school closures over any other group. The key to the issue is not to have people burning the midnight oil thinking up these long, tenuous amendments to solve the problem. Clause 6 should not be in the Bill at all. That would save a lot of time, paper and heart rending discussion. Irrespective of how it is portrayed by us or the media, the clause will immediately instil in the minds of people in Scotland that there are moves afoot to give Catholics protection that others are not to be given. I certainly do not believe that, and I have never heard that any members of the Committee feel that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland has got himself into this fix because he is, in the initial stages, apparently attempting to abrogate the responsibility of school closures. If the Secretary of State wants schools closed, he should close them and he would then have to answer as to why they should be closed, instead of handing over to his hatchet men in places such as Tayside to do the job for him. If there happens to be a human Labour-controlled region, whose members are prepared to go back to the grass roots, to the districts involved, and have discussions on school closures, it might be all right. But I cannot over-emphasise—and my hon Friends know this— that if the matter is left in the hands of these backwoodsmen on Tayside, they will run amok. We can rest assured that one thing will certainly happen if the provision remains in the Bill. There will be representations on a large scale from these denominational bodies, but that will not stop the Taysiders axeing schools as they see fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say, however, that so much has been cut back on education that these bodies must be close to not being able to satisfy the statutory requirements under the education laws. I shall watch closely to see how the problem is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said, the key is not to argue the pros and cons of the amendment, because I confess that I have difficulties as to whether I would vote for or against it. On the one hand, I might be denying at least some people the right to stop a closure, which would upset me. On the other hand, I do not want to be seen voting for a particular group against another, irrespective of what that group may be. I think we may all find ourselves in that difficulty. The way out of the difficulty is to remove the clause altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I join my hon Friends in what they have already said about the amendment. In our view it creates more problems than it solves. It will make matters worse in what, certainly in the West of Scotland, can often be an inflamed situation between the various religious bodies. My hon Friends and hon Members representing the East of Scotland may not be so fully aware of the problems as we in the West.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
There will undoubtedly be suspicion, rightly or wrongly, because it is people's perceptions of issues that matter, not the facts. Certain people, and I am sure we all know who they are, will feel that the Roman Catholic Church is gaining a certain advantage, certain credits, so to speak, that the rest of the population is not being given. They may feel, too, that other churches, which do not have denominational schools but are represented through the non-denominational schools, benefit, and that they themselves will not have the same advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should not say this, but I speak as one who is totally objective on the issue, not being a member of any of the various religious organisations. There is no question, however, that certain people in the Church of Scotland, which is a powerful body —it is the official recognised church in Scotland in the Constitution, with the Queen as its head—[Hon Members: "No."] The Queen is represented, through the High Commissioner, as the head of the Church of Scotland. I stand to be corrected, as I accept that other people's knowledge may be greater than mine on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this is important. Speaking as an elder in the Kirk, I feel that I should defend the Church of Scotland. The Queen is head of the Church of England—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is the head of the Church of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Christ is the head of the Church of Scotland, and when the Queen comes to Scotland she is, of course, a member of the Church of Scotland. She is not its head. Several battles were fought on that issue. The hon Gentleman may not be a historian, but he may remember that, not too many years ago in historical terms, quite a few heads were Chopped off on the question as to who was the head of the Church of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You would soon rule me out of order, Mr. Gourlay, if I started a long historical or theological debate with the Minister on this matter. It was just that I believed that the Queen appointed the High Commissioner of the Church of Scotland to act in a certain capacity at its major annual function, which, of course, is the General Assembly, though I do not know exactly what that relationship is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church of Scotland is a powerful body. It does not, however, run its own denominational schools within the State sector, though it may have one or two in the independent sector. Therefore, many people of the Church of Scotland may feel that they do not have the same advantage in terms of the clause and amendment as do Roman Catholics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view and that of my hon Friends is that the status quo should stand. That would be a better way of handling this matter, rather than tabling an amendment which the Minister says will not give anybody any particular advantages. However much
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
this Committee or the House may feel that that is the case, the perception outside in certain parts of Scotland will be that it does give advantages, and that would make the situation much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During his introductory remarks, the Minister said that it was not the Government's intention to do away with denominational schools, and, accordingly, the Government had no such plans. I accept that. It would not be part of our plans, as such, to introduce the ending of denominational schools. However, it is the view of the Labour Party that denominational schools are not a particularly good thing. They do nothing for the religious divisions in our society, and therefore we ought at least to look at how, with the consent of all denominations, we should phase them out and integrate them with other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it on record that it is the policy of the Labour Party to move towards the gradual integration of denominational schools with non-denominational schools, with the full consent of all concerned. That seems a rational policy. It may not be entirely relevant to this long and complicated amendment—my hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) has done better than I have, as he has counted the number of lines—which has been put into a clause which is already quite complicated. It is difficult even for us to understand and will be even more difficult when it goes outside. It would be much better if the Secretary of State would say that the status quo is the best way forward. It would solve problems instead of creating them. It would not create the religious divisions that can be created by the amendment, however much the Minister may disagree. With my hon Friends I shall vote against the amendment and, if necessary, against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a long-winded amendment. It is even longer than the Minister's speech. The brevity of the Minister's speech had a lot to do with the embarrassing situation in which he found himself with clause 6 which, in fact, makes it easier for local education authorities to close schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there were protests from representatives of the various local education authorities. There were protests from parents, and protests, too, from the Catholic hierarchy. The Minister has now come out with this compromise amendment which he thinks will somehow be a sop to appease the Catholic hierarchy in Scotland. In my opinion, it will go nowhere near to satisfying the legitimate aspirations of all parents, whether they be Catholics, Protestants, Jews, atheists, agnostics or whatever. The Minister should be thoroughly ashamed of having to table the amendment in the first place.

I agree with my hon Friends that the best way to give protection on equality of schools, whether denominational or non-denominational, is to preserve the status quo and throw out the wretched clause 6 of this wretched Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plainly, the Minister has been under pressure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
because of the position of denominational schools, particularly Catholic schools, under the Education Act 1918. It is important to remember that the schools referred to in amendment No. 202 are the transferred schools, many of which were not originally built with public money. I attended St. Bride's primary school in Cowdenbeath. It was built before the 1918 legislation by subscriptions and donations from Catholic parents in the area, many of very modest means, living in a mining community. Rightly or wrongly, they thought that the rights of their children in respect of religious education could not be adequately preserved and maintained unless they built a school of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects the legislators and Catholic parents in 1918 took a far more enlightened view than some other people do today. They felt that the time had come for what were formerly Catholic church schools to be integrated into the local authority education structure. By the time I attended St. Bride's primary school, it was no longer the property of the Catholic parents, the Catholic church, the Catholic hierarchy, or whatever. It was a State school which came under Fife county council, then the local education authority. That applies also to many schools throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain guarantees were given in 1918. We spoke earlier today about private schools. I wish that some of those schools would now take the enlightened view taken in 1918 and try to integrate within the State system and the local education authority system. There is no reason why schools cannot be given a guarantee about the continuation of their educational philosophy and traditions. One of the tragedies of Scottish education is that many of the private and grant-aided schools have not taken the initiative which virtually all the Catholic schools took in 1918, namely, to become part of the local education authority structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taught in both denominational and non-denominational schools and have always believed in equality of opportunity for children attending either type of school. Moreover. I have always believed in the equality of parental rights whether the children of those parents attend a denominational or a non-denominational school. Amendment No. 202 destroys such equality of parental rights between Catholic parents and parents of other religions whose children attend non-denominational schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use the Minister trying to wriggle his way out by saying that the parental rights will be equal and it is the Scottish hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is being given the right to appeal to the Secretary of State. In his various press releases before the Bill was published, he made out that this was a parents' charter, not one for bishops. If he really believes in the equality of parents' rights, irrespective of whether they have or do not have a religion, amendment No. 202 raises questions about his credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, clause 6 if passed as amended by amendment No. 202 will make it easier for local education authorities to close schools. It will put the authorities in the firing line. The Minister will be like Pontius Pilate, washing his hands of the whole issue, or attempting to pass the buck to the education
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
authorities and expecting them to bear the brunt of the difficulties that may be faced in some areas of Scotland. A local authority could propose to close two schools in the same town, or even in the same street, and in one case the Secretary of State would be able to intervene to stop it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he would, but in the other he would not have that opportunity. That is wrong. If the Minister wants to ensure the equality of parental rights, some form of statutory right of appeal to the Secretary of State—for example, by the school council—should be built into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all that the Minister has done, after those secret and confidential discussions with the Catholic hierarchy, is to come up with this amendment. It is simply an attempt to appease the bishops of the Catholic Church in Scotland. I strongly doubt that the vast majority of parents will be pleased with the amendment, and I include Catholic and non-Catholic parents in that. In 1918 nobody in the Catholic community envisaged that their schools would have a uniquely privileged position in respect of school buildings, closures or anything else. They thought then that they were fighting for equality of treatment, irrespective of religious differences. In the amendment the Minister is turning the clock back. It means that on proposals for school closures one set of parents will be denied any right of appeal to the Secretary of State. Even the other set of parents, the Catholics, will be denied any statutory right of appeal. It will be up to the Catholic hierarchy rather than the school council or any other similar body to make an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is making a courageous speech. Can he explain the proposed new subsection (2Xc), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any church or denominational body … other than the Roman Catholic Church"?</p></blockquote>
I should like to know how many schools there are in Scotland run by churches or denominations other than the Scottish hierarchy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has raised an interesting question. I understand that there are a few Episcopalian schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know exactly how many. I believe that there is at least one Jewish school, too. However, I imagine that 99 per cent, of the schools affected by the amendment are Catholic schools. Perhaps when the Minister sums up he will give the accurate figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that communication with the Catholic schools, and the associated statutory right, will be allotted to the Scottish hierarchy, whereas there is no definition of the bodies with which the other schools should communicate. Perhaps the Minister will explain that, too. I understand that the Church of Scotland has some list D schools. There is one at Ballikinrain in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
my constituency. Will the amendment affect them, too? I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me whether the amendment refers only to local education authority schools or to list D schools managed by the Church of Scotland, too?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it distasteful that the Government have felt it necessary to table the amendment. I have no intention of voting against it, because it may help to allay the fears of some Catholic parents, but I do not see why 100 per cent, of the parents should not have their fears allayed if there is any danger of the school that their children attend being closed. I shall therefore vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon Friends, I am in favour of the status quo and the retention of the present statutory right of appeal to the Secretary of State. That is the best way to protect the interests of parents and children, whether the children attend Catholic schools, other denominational schools or non-denominational schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment pretends to cater for one important minority, but I would rather see equal rights given to all the parents and children of Scotland. Voting against the clause will be the best way to attempt to secure those rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no complaint that in discussing the amendments hon Members have been unable to avoid having something like a clause stand part debate. That is understandable. Because they were comparing the details of the amendment with the purpose of the clause, they were bound to stray a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee agrees that education is a sensitive subject in Scotland, but I do not think that in the Committee, or in the House, any subject should be so sensitive that we should be afraid to discuss it. I am glad that in the debate this afternoon hon Members have expressed their views and fears, and almost their beliefs, in the matter of denominational education, particularly when in the Bill generally we are discussing a matter of importance. The Bill significantly changes education in Scotland and makes a number of important improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we agree in the Committee that, among the denominations in Scotland, Roman Catholics in particular feel strongly about the need to include in the teaching of their children a strong religious content. As a non-Roman Catholic, I find no fault in that view. In fact, I wish some of the other denominations, including my own, felt a little more strongly about the need to give religious instruction in our schools. It is not within the powers of the Secretary of State to intervene on the question of religious instruction, even though it is the statutory subject laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the only subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member is correct. It is the only subject laid down in statute. I think it a pity that other denominations in Scotland do not take the subject more seriously. It is usually left to the teachers themselves, who, for whatever reason—they are entitled to a variety of beliefs, or none at all—decide to what extent the regulations for religious instruction are complied with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is misleading the Committee a little when he says that religious education these days is left entirely to the teachers on the basis of what they do or do not believe, and that somehow they are not qualified to do that. Increasingly, of course, in primary education all teachers are obliged as part of their training to take religious education. In the secondary area increasingly there are now qualified experts in religious education, if such a word may be used, to teach that subject on its own. Many non-denominational schools now employ teachers qualified in the teaching of religious education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon Member. I was about to call the Minister to order. I thought he was beginning to stray wide of the amendment. Perhaps he will return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Than you, Mr. Gourlay. I accept your advice. I was trying to make the point that it is a sensitive subject. We should not be afraid to discuss it, and we are discussing it to a considerable extent in relation to Roman Catholic schools. I was adding my personal view that I wished we might be discussing the matter more in relation to the range of so-called non-denominational schools as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no comment on whether Roman Catholics have an advantage in Scotland today in terms of educational provision—I do not say that they have— but if hon Members believe that to be so, I wish it to be understood that the Bill neither increases nor diminishes the position of Roman Catholic schools and education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the amendment necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is necessary simply because of the importance that Roman Catholics attach to religion in schools. They are extremely sensitive to the 1918 Act, which was mentioned by the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and others. They sought reassurance from my right hon Friend that, in the implementation of the provisions of clause 6, no part of the 1918 Act and the balance that has been held in denominational education in Scotland since 1918 would be upset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our negotiations with the Roman Catholic hierarchy we sought to make clear that no change in the balance of the 1918 Act was intended or, indeed, would be made in this Bill. In the course of doing that, we decided that it would give reassurance to denominational schools if an amendment of this kind were moved in Committee and became part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, therefore, seeking to advantage or disadvantage any one denomination. It is misrepresenting the purpose of the amendment, complex as it may seem, to suggest that it is giving advantage to a particular set of parents. I say to the hon Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) that it is the purpose and not the length of the amendment that matters. Although it may appear to be rather lengthy, its purpose is straightforward—to maintain the balance of denominational and non-denominational education in Scotland today. This is particularly important at a time when the school population is falling and school closures are becoming increasingly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
Because of the purpose of the clause on the transfer to local authorities of the right to institute school closures, the question of the balance of denominational education in the 1918 Act was raised with my right hon Friend the Secretary of State, and, as I said, it was considered helpful to have an amendment of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister says regarding the balance, but does he not agree that if clause 6 did not exist the Secretary of State would have the power to ensure that that balance was maintained anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The purpose of clause 6 is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not just clause 6. As the Bill is constructed, we are removing certain powers from the Secretary of State and passing them to the local authorities. It is interesting that hon Members opposite do not think that it is a good thing to remove powers from the Secretary of State and devolve them to the local authorities. We happen to think that, provided that we lay down in legislation, as we have done, for example, on parental choice, the importance of consultation and we prescribe the consultation that should take place between local authorities and the people in the area, there is every reason why the Secretary of State should delegate his powers to the local authorities. In this case, we are delegating the powers and prescribing in the legislation the duties necessary and the consultations that must take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that the Labour Party's view of denominational education was that it should be abolished by moving towards integration. I do not dispute that. I do not wish to raise hackles. I wish merely to make clear the view of the Labour Party. The Conservative Party's view in this—in denominational education as in everything else—is to provide the maximum choice for parents. If parents wish to have denominational education, to choose a non-denominational school outwith a catchment zone, or to go to an independent or grant-aided school, through this measure we lay down provisions to enable them to do that, safeguarding their rights at all times and making sure that the local authorities which administer and manage our schools in Scotland understand their consultations and duties in complying with parental requests. Therefore, as the party of choice in education, we have no objection whatever to denominational schools. Indeed, since I was appointed to this job, I have had the duty of bringing into the responsibility of a local education authority a denominational school that was not Roman Catholic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1918 Act, which I have mentioned and which is an important Act for Roman Catholics, is nevertheless exercised and used in respect of other denominations also. I have had the duty of exercising it in conditions pertaining to another religious denomination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, therefore, and in particular the new section to which the amendment refers, relates to the relationship between the Church authorities and the education authorities. We lay down the consultations that must take place, and it is only if the Church authority is in
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
dispute with the education authority, and they are unable to reach agreement and, after that, only if he considers that the Church has a case against the local authority, will the Secretary of State interfere under the new section in respect of an education authority's request to close a denominational school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rights of parents, therefore, in this case as in others, apply only in relation to the education authority. Whether the children go to a denominational school or a non-denominational school, there is no discrimination. The parents' right of appeal is to the local authority and not to the Secretary of State. But—this is the point made by the hon Member for West Stirlingshire when he was talking about the bishops—the amendment specifies in subsection (2) (c)
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person authorised for that purpose by that church or denominational body"</p></blockquote>
and it adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, in the case of the Roman Catholic Church, by the Scottish Hierachy of that Church",</p></blockquote>
which is the way in which, I am advised, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland should be described. We are talking about '
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person authorised for that purpose by that church or denominational body".</p></blockquote>
That might be described lossely as any
	<br><blockquote><p>"Church or denominational body"</p></blockquote>
and we have the specific definition of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland alongside it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultations with the bishops to which I and other hon Members have referred were about the balance of denominational education in Scotland. It was not about particular school closures. The Roman Catholic bishops are fully aware that school closures will take place and that those will include closures of Roman Catholic schools. They do not dispute that; they accept it. But they are concerned that the balance between denominational and non-denominational education in Scotland which exists at present shall not be damaged by the need to make individual school closures. It is for that reason that the amendment is worded as it is. We are dealing with the balance of denominational education and not with individual school closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complaint of any Church to the Secretary of State must be on the grounds that the balance of denominational provision is being disturbed, not on the grounds that a particular school is being closed. I emphasise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities might prefer the status quo. Every Opposition Member who has spoken has told me that we should leave things as they stand. But COSLA does not like things as they stand. As the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) pointed out, there are delays in school closures. Local authorities go through a consultative process, then the matter goes to the Secretary of State, who in turn goes through a consultative process. That is not just being bureaucratic. The Secretary of State has a duty to undertake a consultative process and not merely say "That looks all right. I think the local authority has done its job. I shall approve it". He in turn has to go through various stages of consultation, and that can on occasion add a further long period to the time it takes from the beginning of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
authority's proposal to close a school to final approval by the Secretary of State and the school being closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. It is a long, complicated procedure and, from the parents' point of view as well as the authority's, it should be a quick procedure, whatever it is, so long as it is fair. But, surely, the Minister will concede that there are ways of speeding up the process, while retaining the appeal to the Secretary of State, without all the paraphernalia that he goes into now. Will he look at such ways as an alternative to the complicated system which discriminates between one sector and another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister would take time between now and Report, or in discussions elsewhere, to consider that point, it would go a long way towards relieving some of our concern. There is time for him to consider an alternative quicker way of allowing the Secretary of State to deal with all appeals over school closures on an equal basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not been short of time in considering the matter. Indeed, we have considered whether there is a quicker way or short cut which would satisfy the requirements and duties on the Secretary of State in reviewing closures and at the same time allow the local authorities to have the decisions implemented more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the choice is about whether the role of the Secretary of State in these matters should continue as at present. There is no point in asking him to be a rubber stamp; he must conduct a proper investigation. Nothing would be more insulting to parents who appealed to the Secretary of State than if he was rather offhand in his examination of their appeals and cases. Therefore, either the Secretary of State should conduct a thorough investigation of complaints from parents who say "Our school is being closed, please stop them closing our school", or he should not be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
We examined the position and decided that the latter should be the case and therefore it was desirable that, with the safeguards built into the Bill, we should devolve that power to the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly answer some of the specific matters that were raised. A list D school is not a school within the meaning of the Act since it is an establishment within the meaning of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Therefore, list D schools are not included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other one is in charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is in charge of list D schools, so hon Gentlemen should watch themselves. If they should find themselves in one, they will know who will not be sympathetic towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked how many school closure references have been made since the start of 1977. Since January 1977 to date, 106 school closure references have been made, of which 13 were denominational. I was also asked about the number of denominational schools. There are 458 schools of which 450 are Roman Catholic—377 primary and 73 secondary. There are eight other denominational schools, seven of which are Episcopalian and one Jewish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to a matter raised by the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who suggested that the proposal to redesignate a school as non-denominational was a loophole in the present plan. In fact, such a proposal would fall within new section 30D(2)(Z>)(v).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the detailed points as well as the principle of an amendment which I freely admit is important to people in Scotland who are interested in education. I hope that the Committee will accept, because it happens to be true, that it is no way discriminatory between denominational and non-denominational education or between different sets of parents in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
