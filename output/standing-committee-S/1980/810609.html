	<div class='page-header'><h1>Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill 	<i>[Lords],</i> the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Rifkind.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The timetabling of the Bill has a somewhat complicated history and I suspect that the discussions about the sittings motion, if printed in a report, would perhaps rival the length of the total report of the Bill when we have completed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are anxious to be helpful. There was an agreement that we should try to get the Bill through its Committee stage, for good reasons, within three sittings days. That has been blown off course by some factors. Although I accept the sittings motion that has been moved, my understanding is that on Tuesday 16 June we may sit twice and that the Minister will be prepared to look at that matter sympathetically if we are not making sufficient progress. If we have not completed the Committee stage by next Tuesday, I understand there is a possibility of a further sitting on the afternoon of 23 June. It is on that basis that I make no objection to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to consider very sympathetically the hon Gentleman's suggestion, if the proceedings this morning and on Thursday morning show that that would be desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during consideration of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill 	<i>[Lords],</i> the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to call to the Committee's attention the fact that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RIGHT OF SPOUSE WITHOUT TITLE TO OCCUPY MATRIMONIAL HOME</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or permitted by a third party" </p></blockquote>
and insert " as owner or lessee".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 8, leave out "or permitted".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the nature of the Bill that many amendments will be tabled in order to obtain information. In every sense they are probing amendments, and amendment No. 1 falls within that category. It has unashamedly been tabled in my name because it is part of my education. I read this Bill with some despair when it was first brought to my attention. Although I am now becoming a little more conversant with its somewhat obscure and difficult phraseology,; so that it takes me a little less time to understand any individual sentence, it is a measure that will cause problems^-certainly to laymen who try to understand it. Some of the terms of art—if I may use that somewhat pretentious phrase—that crop up in it are not immediately comprehensible in detail and in terms of precise boundaries even to members of the legal trade. I hope that they will not be insulted by that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 seeks to omit the key phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"or permitted by a third party"</p></blockquote>
and to insert "as owner or lessee".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an excuse to invite the Minister to say what is covered by the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled, or permitted by a third party".</p></blockquote>
When I first looked at this I was not even clear whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled, or permitted by a third party"</p></blockquote>
should be taken as one grammatical phrase, or whether two catergories were permitted with a different category for a spouse who was entitled. I am not sure whether these are two water-tight compartments or whether the phrase should be taken at a brisk trot to read
	<br><blockquote><p>"is entitled or permitted by a third party".</p></blockquote>
That may be a little difficult to record in the Committee report, but I hope that the intonation will help hon Members to understand what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the word "entitled" will include a feudal proprietor and that is why I have substituted the word "owner". As the word "owner" has not been used, presumably "entitled" also encompasses people who are entitled in other ways to the matrimonial home. I am not sure whether the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"permitted by a third party"</p></blockquote>
includes someone who holds occupancy under a lease or whether that comes under "entitled". Possibly it does and both owner and lessee may be entitled. In that case, I am a little curious about the circumstances in which a spouse is permitted by a third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may envisage a totally informal arrangement whereby there is no written document, formal lease or transfer of ownership, but where one may say "I am hopping off to the Continent for three or four months for an extended holiday. Would you like to occupy my house? You will not pay rent but look after it as a sort of caretaker or warden for the period in which I am absent." I do not know what categories the Minister envisages, but as these phrases repeat through the Bill with slightly depressing frequency—I do not say "ad nauseam" as that would be pejorative—it may help if the Minister gave us a definition. After all, it is a key legal concept of the Bill. Presumably those who advise him have taken the trouble to produce a definition of what I presume to be two categories—a spouse who is entitled and a spouse who is permitted by a third party to occupy a matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I shall listen with interest to the Minister and shall no doubt shortly be much improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a categorical assurance that the hon Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will be improved either by what I say or by anything else that takes place in the Committee, but I can certainly answer his specific questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is correct to say that the Bill in its present form encompasses two categories—the entitled spouse and the spouse who is permitted to occupy a property. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the rights of the non-entitled spouse—normally the wife—will be comparable to the legal position of the entitled spouse— normally the husband. The hon Gentleman's amendment would replace the terms used by two specific forms of entitlement, namely, that of the owner or of the lessee. In the vast majority of cases the nature of the spouse's legal rights will be properly described. But these are not exclusive and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to use these words in preference to those in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five examples of categories which would not come under the definition of owner or lessee. The first is where a life rent existed, when the spouse would not technically be a lessee, although one might think so given the terminology of a life rent. The second is where there had been permission from the trustees of a discretionary family trust or from another person, such as a friend or relation. The third, is where there was a permission from an acquiring authority where the matrimonial home had been compulsorily acquired. The fourth, is where there was a permission from the landlord who had terminated the husband's entitlement to occupy the home under the lease, but who nevertheless allowed him to remain in occupation until the property was disposed of. The last is where there had been a permission from the trustee in sequestration, who by operation of law became vested in the home on the husband's bankruptcy, but who allowed the husband to remain in occupation until the home was put up for sale
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples are of fairly unusual circumstances. They will not happen often, but there is no particular reason why a spouse's right will not apply in these cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible, however, that there could be a question about the entitlement of the third party? Does the hon Gentleman not envisage that possibility? One would therefore have to add "or permitted by an entitled third party". The third party would have to be legally entitled to do the granting. It is not clear what the third party's entitlement is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is right and wrong, if I may say so. He is right that the situation would apply only where the third party, who had given permission, was entitled to give permission. That is however, implicit in the wording. Clearly, if the third party were not so entitled, it would be impossible to expect the court to impose these occupancy rights. The clause states only what the occupancy rights are. For them to be enforceable, a spouse has to go to the court. Clearly, if it could be put as a defence or as an
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
argument against enforcing these rights that the third party did not have title to give permission, that would be an adequate defence. The hon Gentleman may be assured that that is implicit in the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The categories that I have mentioned arise in relatively unusual circumstances, but there is no particular reason why a spouse in these circumstances should not have the same rights as the other spuose. On that basis, it seems more appropriate to have the wider terminology which its nature is all-encompassing rather than restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that a fair degree of ingenuity has gone into producing five categories. If I may make an admission to the Committee, I have never worked in the kind of law office which was too much involved in life rents and discretionary family trusts. The atmosphere of deed box and cobwebs is one that I have never found conducive to a reasonable quality of existence. I am prepared to take the Minister's word that a few of these extraordinary legal concepts still lurk in the backwoods of St. Vincent Street and George Street, or wherever solicitors in Edinburgh hang out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to push the amendment to a Division, but I am not entirely satisfied. I think that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled, or permitted by a third party"</p></blockquote>
is lacking in definition. It is not immediately obvious, even to a lawyer, what it comprises. I do not seriously suggest that "owner or lessee" is a comprehensive list that could reasonably and properly be put in its place. I accept that there will be circumstances in which there could be a right which ought to give a spouse occupancy protection which would not be covered by those two phrases, although they will probably deal with the majority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing to remember is that the occupancy right of the spouse cannot exist once the original rights of the owner, the lessee, the beneficiary under the discretionary trust or the person enjoying the life rent have expired. For example, if I were unwise enough to allow someone to come and stay in my house, without any written agreement, perhaps for a very small consideration—"to meet the rates" is the kind of informal agreement that one might make—I could presumably always come back and defeat an occupying wife who had enforced her rights under clauses 3 or 4, in the same way as I could go to the courts and defeat the rights of the spouse against whom she had claimed her right of occupancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that that is a reasonable safeguard. I am prepared to look carefully at what the Minister has said. I very much doubt whether it will fall within my competence to produce any other form of words. But we may meet these words later on clause stand part, when I shall have specific questions to ask the Minister which may help further to define the matter. Unless any of my hon Friends wish to make an intervention, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 9, after "home", insert "(an "entitled spouse")".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment it will be for the convenience of the Committee to take a large number of Government amendments: Nos. 4, 5, 7, 9 to 12, 14, 15, 18 to 21, 23 to 32, 37, 40, 48 to 50, 55 to 63, 67 to 73, 75 to 77, 80 to 84, 86 to 112, 117 to 122, 124 to 126,139 to 141,147,149 to 151, 154 and 155.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the relief of the Committee that you, Mr. Henderson, have chosen to group together approximately 100 Government amendments in this category. The grouping is not unreasonable, because the amendments all say exactly the same thing and arise from the massive defeat sustained by the Government in the House of Lords on a matter of considerable drafting importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill in its original form referred to the two categories of spouse as, on the one hand a "titled" spouse and, on the other, a "non-titled" spouse. However, the noble Lord Selkirk, in the other place, took great exception to the use of the phraseology on the grounds that, as his Lordship eloquently argued, a "titled" spouse was, by definition, a spouse with a title, and spouses with titles were only those sitting in the upper House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if this phraseology were allowed to remain in the Bill, it would clearly imply that only those who sit in the other place need be the subject of exclusion orders or who batter their wives and do various other kind or unkind acts within the matrimonial relationship. We were not convinced by that approach. The phrase a "titled spouse" and the concept of a title are used in other parts of the law, and they have little to do with membership of the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the other House, by a large majority, was persuaded to accept the amendment that had been tabled. In view of the strong feelings expressed, we agreed to consider whether an amendment would be appropriate. The most sensible phraseology that we might use seems to be "entitled" and "non-entitled", which will have the same effect and implications and meet the concern expressed by their lordships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis on which the amendments have been tabled. They all deal with the question of phraseology. The only amendment in the group to which I should draw the Committee's attention is amendment No. 55, which not only incorporates the terms "entitled" and "non-entitled" but clarifies the intention that it is only the occupancy right related to the specific matrimonial home in respect of which the entitled spouse ceases to be entitled and which will cease to have effect. The amendment deals with the duration of orders under the Bill. I thought it might be useful to explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled this massive list of amendments because we do not wish to face the danger of a constitutional conflict with the upper House. Although we do not maintain that this wording is superior to the original wording, nevertheless, it has the same effect and will meet the point that their lordship felt so strongly about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Pollock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray and Nairn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister advise the Committee whether the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
ment gave any thought to the rather unusual position of the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) and his spouse in the wording?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the kind of consideration that concerned noble Lord Selkirk. Whether a spouse is titled or not is a matter to which each hon Member will wish to give considerable thought. I am sure that my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) will quite happily speak for himself and, indeed, for his spouse, given that she is unable to take advantage of the Committee to make her own point of view known. Such a case shows the considerations which were paramount in their lordships' minds when the Bill was being considered in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, this is a matter of little importance. But, at another level, I find it a fascinating little exercise. I am not at all happy about the basis on which the Government have proceeded here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As no doubt did all the other members of the Committee, I took the trouble to consult the report of the brief debate in another place covering this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend was entitled to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) said, I was entitled to do so. The report made improving reading. Those who have not looked thoroughly at the speeches will find them in the House of Lords 	<i>Hansard,</i> dated 9 April 1981, Col. 679.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the noble Lord Selkirk moved the amendment on the basis, as the Minister has clearly said, that "titled" could be understood to have only one meaning—namely, a person with a handle, either a life or hereditary peerage, which allowed him to sit in another place. As the Minister knows, that was a misconception of the noble lord and of anyone who believed in that narrow exclusive meaning of the word.

In a brief speech, Lord Scarman told us several interesting things. He expressed his pleasure that a large number of Scotsmen still go to Balliol. I did not quite follow the relevance of that remark to the noble lord's line of argument. He also told us that he consulted a dictionary, and that that was something he rarely did. That struck me as a little surprising for someone in his profession, but perhaps the noble lord is so competent in the English language that such a sign of frailty is unnecessary to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

lessly criticising even my political colleagues. However Lord Searman went on with the aid of the Oxford English Pictionary to make a genuinely sensible case for saying that to define "titled" in the way Lord Selkirk had done was totally wrong and could not be supported by anyone who had looked in the matter in the most, cursory way. Of course, "titled" can mean someone who is a peer, a marquis or some other archaic form of human life, but there are many overlapping definitions in the English language, and I do not think that anyone would maintain that that meaning of the word was exclusive. Lord Searman quoted Milton:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that saber race of men whose lives religious title them the sons of God". </p></blockquote>
Lord Searman points out that "title them" merely means "identifies them as". I would have thought that "title" had that broader meaning. To suggest that it is the exclusive preserve of the House of Lords is a piece of linguistic monopoly to which the Committee should not give great countenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not also another sphere in which somebody is given a title which does not apply to the archaic individuals to whom my hon Friend has just referred—the title that a referee is sometimes given at a football match?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is doubless right as he is very much in touch with popular opinion on those matters. I do not wish to quarrel with his remarkably detailed and, no doubt, personal experience of those fields—and the word "fields" is not an intentional pun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even if one accepts the argument that "titled" has several meanings, one of which means membership of the House of Lords or of the aristrocracy or a minor, humble but no doubt satisfying, entry in Debrett's Peerage, it is ludicrous to say that it is embarrassing for their lordships to have the word "title" attached to a Bill dealing with matrimonial violence. I would not be so rude, because 1 do not think that it could be justified, as to say that they do protest too much. However, I have no reason to think that peers are any more guilty of misconduct in this area than any other cross section of humanity. Neither have I reason to think that they are any less guilty. But the idea that it would be embarrassing for them or would somehow bring a slur upon their noble heads seems fanciful in the extreme. If we accept that there is no basis for this nonsense—it really is nonsense—I am surprised that the Government have decided to give into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Earl of Mansfield tried hard to persuade their lordships not to rush to judgment, saying that the Government could not see any final advantage in the point that was being made, but, as so often happens, his words fell on deaf ears. I think that he was a little tentative in some of his judgments. He came to a startling conclusion—startling but defensible, because apparently it was reached with the advice of draftsmen. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am advised by the draftsman that 'titled' in Scots law has a meaning, although in the presence of noble and learned Lords I say that with some kind of diffidence."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 9 April 1981; Vol. 419, c. 681.]</p></blockquote>
Having discovered the remarkable truth that the word "title" has a meaning and having assured their lordships that he had taken advice from his draftsmen
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and been told that it had a meaning, the noble lord then conspicuously failed to tell us what it was. This came as a great disappointment to me because I had been eagerly—I think that is the word—skimming my way through the columns of print looking for that definition as the denouement of Lord Mansfield's spirited stance for the purity of the English language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the paragraph of Lord Elwyn-Jones. It seems to me to add nothing of value to our deliberations. I do not say that in any mean spirit, because it was a very short contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Selkirk came across a point which intrigued him and which he no doubt thought was worthy of being raised. It is a non-point, to which I should have thought that no responsible Government would have listened. The Earl of Mansfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"1 believe very strongly that in order that we do not make a Bill more cumbersome than need be, there should be some expression which is handy and convenient and easily understood and shortening in its effect."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 9 April 1981; Vol. 419, c. 682.]</p></blockquote>
That seems to me to be a perfectly good principle on which to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may seem a small point, but I make it quite seriously. I do not think that I am any less tongue-tied than anyone else in this world or any better at getting my tongue round difficult phrases, syllables, dipthongs and consonants, but I find it difficult to say "an entitled spouse". I think that there is virtue in simply saying "a titled spouse". Indeed, if I were before a rather carnaptious sheriff with a difficult case to plead, it would be a considerable annoyance to me—I say this quite seriously—constantly to make this great mental effort to say "And, my Lord, my client is an entitled spouse" or, worse still, "a non-entitled spouse". It would be much quicker and would require much less precision of diction merely to say "a titled spouse" or "a non-titled spouse", and to do without the intrusive prefix "en", which has appeared in this formidable battery of amendments merely because, as far as I can make out, the Government do not wish to be bothered with taking out one small intrusion in the Bill. The word "entitled" has so far appeared only once as a result of the Earl of Selkirk's efforts. It would have been a great deal better if their lordships had stood their ground and left us with "titled" rather than "entitled".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of great principle. No doubt to the average layman both words will be totally incomprehensible, and no doubt to lawyers after a time both will be comprehensible. I cannot believe that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) would admit to any puzzlement, because he is concerned with the Bill and has spent a great deal of time with the briefs. No doubt we shall hear from him later in our proceedings when the commendable enthusiasm for these matters shown by the hon Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) flags or, when he is perhaps called away on other business. I genuinely look forward to the debut of the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West—perhaps later this morning or at another sitting —on some of the nicer points of drafting in this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could speak on this matter for many hours, I suspect. If there were no good will on the Opposition side and if we had not reached a working arrangement because we are anxious to see the Bill make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
good progress, no doubt I would. I hope that I have said enough to indicate that, despite all the flippancy, there is a serious point here. The amendments are being introduced in response to a rather silly little misconception in the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal has no value in improving the Bill. It has put no doubt diligent and admirable people in the draftsman's office, whose time is valuable, to a great deal of trouble to put all this together. It has produced a form of words—it is a serious matter, because these words will constantly be used in court and in pleadings —which is infelicitous in terms of ease of diction. My view is that it should be resisted. The Government should reconsider it in case by Report we have the great burden of a sort of legislative grand old Duke of York. Having marched ourselves up the aristocratic heights to please the Earl of Selkirk, although it may not have the same social tone, there might be some virtue in the Minister considering whether he should march down the hill again to please the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden and, I suspect, some of his hon Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It never ceases to amaze me how the radical instincts of Opposition Members always seem to dissipate, if not entirely to disappear, as soon as they become enobled and go to another place. If we look at the Division lists of the upper House, we find that not only those to whom I referred, but Lord Ross of Marnock and a whole host of former Labour Ministers and radical Labour Members of Parliament, having received the ermine, were not persuaded by arguments of the nature put forward by the hon Gentleman, but supported Lord Selkirk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may come as a great shock to the Under-Secretary, because I recognise that he is interested only in the purities of debate and the worth of arguments, but their lordships may have worked on the assumption—I hope that the hon Gentleman will allow for this human frailty—that if the Government were opposing the amendment it must be a good amendment. It is a good rule of thumb.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Refkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be the basis on which not only the Opposition in the Lords but the Opposition in the Commons normally operate. I have no doubt that when the hon Gentleman becomes the first Lord Garscadden he may respond in a similar fashion. It is part of a working arrangement, which I have no doubt will command the support of both sides of the Committee, and the quicker the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the merits of this issue, I assure the hon Gentleman that if we believed that the word "entitled" would have a different effect from the word "titled", we would not have been prepared to accept the amendment. But the hon Gentleman has not sought to suggest that the new phraseology, although it may be more difficult for him to pronounce, has any different legal implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was of interest that, for example, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, one of the Scottish Lords |of Appeal, seemed to take the view that the term "entitled" might be more appropriate in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
It is on this basis that the amendments are put down. They do not change the meaning. If we can meet the susceptibilities of a large number of their lordships of all political persuasions, the Government in their normal, reasonable frame of mind are perfectly happy to respond as they have done. I am glad that the hon Gentleman, although he has expressed his qualifications and doubts on this matter, would not wish to go against his noble Friends in another place. On that basis, I am sure that the Committee will be only too happy to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there are excellent arguments for not taking on board the view of our noble Friends in another place. I am not certain that we should agree with them. I think that they are totally wrong. It is quite unacceptable that in 1981 their lordships should tell us what a titled spouse is. I think that they have no competence in that area. It is for us in this Committee to decide what is a titled spouse or a non-titled spouse. I have not heard enough from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will someone in a court of law 100 years from now, who has long since forgotten Lord Pentlands, as he will surely become, be able to determine what we were about this morning when we were discussing this matter? The difference between "titled spouse" and "entitled spouse" seems to me so small that I cannot understand why the Government have even agreed to consider what their lordships proposed. As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, they engaged in a very silly little exercise in order to make some point about their wives, who have only courtesy titles in any event. With few exceptions, they do not have seats in the House of Lords— unless we are talking not about wives, but about husbands and wives. No doubt the Minister will say more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to tell the Committee why the Government took this matter on board and why they thought it necessary to alter in this one piece of legislation what a title is. Why is there not a whole series of Bills? can we be promised that the Queen's Speech at the beginning of the next Session of Parliament will contain amendments to every Bill that refers to a title? The Government should be consistent. If they are not prepared to do that, I cannot see why they have singled out this piece of legislation. They are mistaken in taking this action. A good policy for the Government to embrace is always to disapprove of or to disagree with the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I concur with everything that my hon Friend has said, I want to develop the argument a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established beyond any reasonable doubt that "titled" does not apply exclusively to members of the House of Lords or to their relations. But I am concerned about the term "non-entitled spouse". That is a quaint piece of Victoriana. As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewer) said, perhaps in itself the issue is not terribly important, but I can envisage a case in the Sheriff's court where the press is present and someone is reported as a "non-entitled spouse". There is an innuendo, an implication, in that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
There are many examples in Scottish law where seemingly innocuous and meaningless titles are misused to denigrate people. Perhaps we should give consideration to doing away with the phrase "common law wife". It is used as a term of denigration. We all know what the popular press can do with words such as "He lived with his common law wife". Such words imply that a common law wife who has lived with a man for 25 years is less of a being than somebody who has been legitimately married for six months. That is unfair and is often not an accurate representation of the status of the spouse. "Non-entitled spouse" is just another example of olde worlde phraseology that can be used to do people a great deal of harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give the Minister another couple of examples. The word "adopted" is stamped on the birth certificate of adopted children. That is another handle that can be applied to people and used to set them apart from the rest of society, implying that they are that wee bit different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "illegitimate" may in many cases be technically accurate. But could it morally be disputed that anyone could be described legally as "illegitimate"? I think not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given those examples, I ask the Government to look again at "non-entitled spouse", because it has no meaning one way or the other. It could be misinterpreted and misused to belittle someone who did not deserve to be belittled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the points made are reasonable. Some have been met in many respects. The hon Member for Paisley (Mr. Adams) referred to the adoption of children. The word "adopted" does not now appear on the birth certificate of a child. It is right and it has been generally agreed that it should not appear, unless there are very special circumstances. He also referred to the description of a person as a "common law wife". That has always been intended to increase, not diminish, that person's status. If the person concerned has not gone through a marriage ceremony and if one were not able to describe her as a "common law wife", she would be unmarried and described as such. Scots law many hundred so years ago recognised that persons could, in effect, be regarded as married if they had lived together for many years in what appeared to be a marital relationship. Therefore, the term is meant not to diminish but to increase status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in thinking that the law of Scotland now recognises that it is no longer possible to acquire a common law wife and that therefore the very denegration that worries the hon Member for Paisley (Mr. Adams) is no longer applicable in legislation? Common misusage has led to this unfortunate press term of art being bandied about as it now is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There may still be some very elderly couples who never went through a ceremony of marriage many years ago but who, for legal purposes, are today recognised as being married. My hon Friend's point is perfectly fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the use of the phrase "titled spouse", we are dealing with a word which, although often used in the context of the House of Lords, covers far greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
things. It covers titles to books. The Bill itself starts off with the words "A Bill intituled"—the same word—and continues with a description of what the Bill is about. We talk about titles to property. Indeed, in the Bill an "entitled spouse" is simply one who is entitled to live in the house in question. But the hon Gentleman's points basically support the Government's amendments, since, by the wording that will now appear, the spouse is "entitled" to certain occupancy rights. That is clear of all the connotations about which the hon Gentleman was concerned. I have no doubt that agreement can properly be reached on that basis. It is now a sensible use of language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee further on this matter. I think that the Minister is wrong in giving way on the point. I think that it carries no value and that the balance of convenience would rest with the Government's original proposal. The idea of doing something to keep Lord Selkirk or any other noble lord happy is no more valid than doing something that is wrong merely to keep me or Government supporters happy. I do not suggest for a moment that the phrase "an 'entitled spouse' " is a tongue-twister as formidable as "The Leith police dismisseth us". It is an unfortunate phrase to introduce. I merely record my dissent and say that we are paying the price—albeit a small one— for the Minister's wish to remain popular with another place. I am sorry that he has done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 4, in page 1, line 10, after "permitted", insert "(a 'non-entitled spouse')".</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 3, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another probing amendment of which we can perhaps dispose fairly quickly. To encourage the Committee, I may say that the next amendment, No. 13, is one of real substance on which the Committee may want to listen to arguments. But this amendment, which would leave out subsection (2), is an invitation again to the Minister to say a word or two about the intentions behind a particular form of drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that subsection (2) further defines an "entitled spouse". I am already paying the price in having to say "an 'entitled spouse' " with care instead of merely saying "a 'titled spouse'". It states that in subsection (1) an "entitled spouse" will include a
	<br><blockquote><p>"spouse who is entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy a matrimonial home along with an individual who is not the other spouse only if that individual has waived his or her right of occupation in favour of the spouse so entitled or permitted."</p></blockquote>
I think—I may be wrong—that this is what is called the two sisters' case. Would the Minister say a word or two about that case and whether there are other circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is the individual who is "not the other spouse", and who is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled, or permitted by the third party, to occupy"</p></blockquote>
The most obvious case would be one where a family
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
home has been left to two siblings—let us say, two sisters. One of the sisters marries and the other allows the married sister and her spouse to occupy the property. Let us assume that the married sister gets into trouble with her husband and the marriage breaks up. The husband then goes to court under clause 3, or to seek an exclusion order under clause 4, to put the sister who is the joint owner out of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the simplest case, but, as I understand it, in those circumstances an application for an exclusion order under the Bill, when enacted, would be valid if the sister—the joint owner—had waived her rights of occupancy. I am not clear what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that that type of case is covered by the provision? Could other cases—perhaps I have not spent enough time- speculating—arise where the clause could be brought into practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in such circumstances, what does "waiver" amount to? When we talk of waiver in other areas, there is specific statutory definition. For example,, under subsections (5) and (6) of this clause a waiver of rights has to be signed: "before a notary public or a justice of the peace". Later, consents to a dealing in property will be defined, presumably, by Acts of Sederunt, if I remember rightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear what waiver means in this provision. Is it a formal document which must be attested and which can physically be produced? Can waiver be implied by circumstances only? An example is the sister who has not lived in a house for 10 or 15 years and does not maintain it but says "You can have occupancy, and you must take over all the outgoings", and who lives in another part of the country. Does that amount to an implicit waiver which would allow proceedings under this part of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters of some importance. I am sure that the Minister will explain how he sees them working. Will he tell us about the circumstances, who the individual might be, and how that individual can waive his right of occupation? Is occupation ownership in this sense? Could there be other than joint ownership? I do not know, but I suppose that it would be possible to have joint lessees. I have not come across such a case in Scotland, because leasehold is extremely uncommon in private domestic property in Scotland. But I suppose that what I regard—-with my Presbyterian approach— as the pernicious southern habit of leasehold fiats and so on, therefore depreciating every year in a way that I should find throughly uncomfortable, could be introduced into Scotland. Theoretically, subsection (2) could apply to a case where a lease was held in joint names. Again, would there have to be an assignation of the lease or some formal waiver before the exception became operative under this provision
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have caught my drift. These are fairly obvious questions. This is a little clause, and I should legitimately like to see a good deal of flesh put upon what are somewhat skeletal bones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that in one of its memoranda the Law Society of Scotland says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to sub-clause (2)"—</p></blockquote>
I presume, of this clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Committee had some difficulty understanding what this
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
clause was designed to cover. Having read paragraph 11 of Chapter 2 of the Scottish Law Commission Report, the Committee now appreciates the scope of the clause but is of the view that it would be desirable for the clause to be more explicit … since it will not then be possible so easily to refer back to the Scottish Law Commission Report."</p></blockquote>
If I may say so, mea culpa, I have not spent enough time on this and cannot remember what the Law Commission report said in that paragraph. The Minister will no doubt refresh my memory. But in the draft Bill at the end of the report there was no definition equivalent to this, and certainly not in the same part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise. I see that it comes later. But the general points about definitions remain to be answered, and I look forward with interest to the Minister's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I also solicit the Ministers opinion on one matter in the clause which comes to my mind? Let us say that there are two parties-party A and party B—and that when the matrimonial home breaks up party B, being a titled spouse, departs. Does the Minister interpret the provision to mean that before party A can cohabit with another party, he has to consult party B, his entitled spouse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the question posed by the hon Member for Paisley (Mr. Adams). Nothing in the Bill either prevents or, I hope, encourages cohabitation. That matter is decided by the individuals concerned. The Bill is concerned only with an occupancy right and the enforcement of that right. Therefore, if, in the circumstances mentioned by the hon Gentleman, one party has left the matrimonial home, there is nothing to stop the other party cohabiting with a third party if he or she so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no prejudice to the status in the home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no prejudice as such. The only problem arises if the party who has left the matrimonial home wishes to exercise his or her occupancy right, and the court would be entitled to take into account all the circumstances when deciding whether that would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the point raised by the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). As he conceded, that matter appeared in the draft Bill of the Law Commission for the purposes indicated by the hon Gentleman. There may be circumstances of either ownership or tenancy where a third party shares the right to occupy the property. The Law Commission indicated in its conclusions that it would be inappropriate for a third party's position to be potentially prejudiced because of the exercise of one occupancy right by one spouse as against the other spouse. Paragraph 2.11 of the Law Commission's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In such a case the conferring of an occupancy right on the wife would affect not only her husband but also the other member of the husband's family. We think that in such cases the wife should not have an occupancy right unless the relevant third party has waived his right of occupation thus permitting the husband to enjoy, with his wife and children, the exclusive occupancy of the dwelling."</p></blockquote>
The most common circumstance may be the kind suggested by the hon Gentleman where property
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
has been left to two people, such as sisters, or those with another relationship, where only one is actually occupying the house although the other has a legal right to the property and natural interest in what happens to it and in who occupies it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is not intended to prejudice or inhibit the position of third parties, whether they are co-owners, co-lessees, or have some other legal relationship with the entitled spouse, it is right that their position should not be prejudiced as a consequence of the Bill. On the other hand, simply to forbid the exercise of occupancy rights where there is a third party would be unnecessarily rigid and inflexible. Therefore, it seems sensible, as the Law Commission proposed and as the Bill incorporates, to have a provision whereby a party who has a title or permission to occupy the property should be able to waive these rights and enable the normal occupancy rights to be proposed and enforced as if there had been no third party interest. It is in the interests of flexibility that a power of waiver should exist. The Law Commission recommended that, and the Law Society recognised that it seemed sensible to have such a provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No formal procedure is laid down as to how a waiver should be exercised, and it would be a matter of common sense for the court to determine whether a third party interest had been waived in an acceptable manner. On that basis, the Bill is drafted in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one begins to discuss such matters in probing amendments, one follows the lines of one's thoughts and they develop. I am glad that we raised the matter. The shape of the Minister's remarks was not unexpected. I am not entirely happy about the inference of the waiver. I suppose it is unreasonable to think that there should be some form of statutory waiver before the provision can come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now looked at paragraph 2.11 of the Law Commission report, and it does not help me. I suspect that if that joint owner or joint lessee is not living in the property and taking a direct interest in it, just by the passage of time there will presumably be a tendency for the courts to assume that a waiver can be inferred. I suppose that that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman must also appreciate that if there were a disagreement between the two spouses and the husband were having an occupancy right enforced upon him, if he had available to him a defence of the kind indicated because of the existence of a third party who had not waived his rights, clearly the husband would draw this to the attention of the court as a reason why an occupancy right should not be enforced. Therefore, there is a double way in which this matter would be resolved in these circumstances. The third party would be living in the house, in which case he would be aware of what was happening, or, even if he were not, the husband would be in a position to draw that to the attention of the court if it were a matter of controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I see that, and I do not doubt that that is so. I am wondering, however—I do not intend to follow this at any great length—-what justification there
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
is for this provision. After all, it is based upon the assumption that the occupancy right, if it is exercised, will prejudice the third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to tell me in what way the third party's rights will be prejudiced by the exercise of an occupancy right. Let us assume that a house is owned by two sisters and that one of them is living in the house with her husband, there is a break-up in the marriage and, perhaps a little unusually, it is the husband who is trying to enforce the occupancy rights— perhaps because he has custody of the children. We are saying that that should be done only if the occupancy rights of the other spouse have been waived, not if the other spouse is not living there. Presumably the other spouse might not be living there, but, one might have thought, had specifically preserved occupancy rights, perhaps to go and live there with the other people on retirement—if the sister whom we are considering here was not married and was living in another part of the country, because of her job for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the sister has not waived her occupancy rights and therefore there is no way in which the husband can get occupation under the Bill. Why should he be denied that right? After all, by definition he has been living in the house. Presumably, if the sister had decided to exercise her rights of occupancy, which are still alive but not being exercised, she would have found herself living in the house with him in any event. If she is not living there, how is she prejudiced merely because it is the husband and not the wife who is also her sister who will be in occupation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole concept of prejudice to the person who has preserved a right of occupancy is perhaps a little hard to define. Perhaps the Minister could say a little more about the circumstances in which that prejudice could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that under a lease any landlord is prejudiced at one level, in the sense that he had made an arrangement whereby he let the house to a husband only to discover that an occupancy right and an exclusion order had been in force and that the wife was living in the house, but not as his tenant, because the tenancy agreement would still exist with the original lessee, the husband. No one has suggested that that in some way would prejudice the landlord and be a reason for not allowing the greater social justice of the exclusion order to take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little surprised and unclear as to what prejudice is referred to in paragraph 2.11. It says that there may be prejudice, but I am not clear how it would arise. Perhaps the Minister would give a couple of examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct that to some extent the position of a landlord is affected by the provisions of the Bill, in so far as the landlord might end up with a tenant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Occupier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, an occupier, who becomes a tenant in effect—different from the person with whom the original tenancy was entered into. But that is a slightly different circumstance. There the landlord's basic interest in the tenancy is that the rent should be paid and the property maintained. So long as that is being done, the landlord has no basic problem as to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0943">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
nature and indentity of the individual occupying the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when we are talking about two persons, one of whom is a third party who may be living in the matrimonial home—we are concerned with the right to live in the matrimonial home—whether that is the landlord or a co-owner or some other third party, clearly his interests would be significantly affected if the person with whom he had a right to occupy the matrimonial home turned out to be someone different, for reasons beyond his control and over which he had no influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, there were two co-owners and one was content to have co-ownership with the other party, given the identity of the person concerned, if it turned out that it was no longer the husband but the wife, the personal relationship between the wife and the third party may be such as to make that extremely difficult and to be grossly unfair from the point of view of the third party. By definition, the third party has a right to live in the matrimonial home. It seems unreasonable that the person with whom he is entitled to exercise that right may be changed for reasons beyond his control and in a way that he cannot prevent but which will have considerable implications for him in a disagreeable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission had such circumstances in mind. It seems that we are concerned with fairness between spouses, but it should not be at the expense of third parties. It is on that basis that the Law Commission made its recommendation. I should have thought that the hon Gentleman would not wish to depart from at least the principle of this part of the clause—namely, that the interests of a third party should not be inhibited or prejudiced by reasons relating to the relationship between the two spouses—one entitled and the other not so entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that probably there is not so much between the Minister and myself as thought processes suggest at this stage and I shall not press the matter much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this scenario or thought to the Minister. Let us suppose that two brothers are living in a property as joint owners and one of them marries. The wife comes along and sets up home in the house. They all live together for some years, but unfortunately the marriage then breaks up. It is no one's fault. Three people have lived together for a long time. There may even be children of the marriage to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, of course, the third party—in this case the unmarried brother—has an interest. I accept that. But as it is clear that, by definition—because he is living there—he has not waived his occupancy rights, under clause 1(2) his failure to waive those rights, rules out per se any possibility of an occupancy right being enforced on the property for the half share interest of the married brother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that it should be an absolute ban in that way. It would need complicated redrafting and I would not pretend that I have suitable wording in mind. But I am not sure that the equity of such a situation should not be that the titled unmarried sibling should be given a right as a party to any argument. Certainly his interests ought to be included in some form of words in
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the criteria to be considered by the court under clause 3 if it is regulating or declaring an occupancy right. It might be
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the spouses in relation to each other and otherwise;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the respective needs and financial resources of the spouses;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the needs of any child of the family"</p></blockquote>
the rights and needs and so on of a third party who is a co-owner or a joint lessee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me here is that there might be a situation—we are all constructing hard cases—where the wife and children had been living in the house for several years. It might be that the house could easily be divided and it would be possible to have an amicable arrangement, at least in terms of equity. Unfortunately, it would not be amicable if, because of the relationships, agreement could not be reached. Yet, the rights of the spouse of the co-owner are totally defeated without getting to the starting line in terms of the Bill. She and her children will be refugees, reliant, perhaps, on the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, and there will be no way in which she can try to enforce her matrimonial rights in terms of occupancy purely because of the failure to waive the rights of that other spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is perhaps too hard the other way. There may be a compromise position which would ensure that the co-owner who is not married and has not waived her occupancy rights is not prejudiced without any right of representation and which would also allow the courts to look at the equity of the case and not exclude entirely the separated spouse of the other half of the joint ownership from the machinery of the legislation. I am sure that the Minister follows that point. I feel that, while legitimately wanting to protect the third party— I accept that there must be protection for the third party—we may have given him a right of veto which excludes all possibility of action under what we agree is an important Bill giving important rights to spouses. I think that this point is worth reconsidering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once one replaces existing provisions by simply making this a matter for the discretion of the court in the light of all the circumstances, one accepts that the third party, who is not a party to the dispute between the two spouses and has no responsibility for the dispute, may be put at a major disadvantage for reasons which are not his cause or responsibility. The hon Gentleman will be aware that in another part of the Bill we are seeking to remove just such a provision as a result of representations—I understand from his comments on Second Reading that he shares this view-that it would be grossly unfair to put a bona fide third party at a disadvantage as a result of a dispute between a husband and wife. This is a similar matter. Indeed, similar considerations which led the Government to change the Bill in that respect, and which were the basis of the hon Gentleman's representations, must apply here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. We are dealing with a situation where, for example, an exclusion order may be made against a spouse who may be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
co-owner of the house. The other co-owner—the third party—is then required to continue living with the other spouse with whom there is no legal relationship and towards whom there may be personal animosity. That is not unlikely given the possibility that, say, two brothers may be the co-owners, one has been excluded from the house and the other is required to continue living there with his sister-in-law. Because of the breakup of the marriage the co-owner may take the side of his brother with all the animosity involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman may say that the courts will take that into account. But that is not good enough. First, that means accepting that the court should be entitled to put to major disadvantage a third party who is not responsible for the break-up and who has no responsibilities to either of the parties. If we made it discretionary, the court would be entitled to assume that Parliament conceived of circumstances in which, irrespective of inconvenience, animosity and unfairness to the third party, that should be permitted. I do not believe that is a fair conclusion to draw, and the Law Commission certainly did not take that view. I do not envisage circumstances where an innocent third party will be put at that disadvantage and inconvenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue this matter for a moment as it is important, and we have stumbled on a significant argument. I can envisage the situation to which the Minister referred. He is building his case firmly and, from his point of view, wisely on a situation in which the third party who might be prejudiced is occupying the jointly-owned home. In those circumstances, 1 agree that there can be prejudice. But in all these matters there can be prejudice. It can be between spouses, between owners and tenants or those occupying the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end it is up to the courts to look at all the circumstances and to try to make an honest judgment on where possibly no more than social expediency and convenience lies, given that there may be children, and so on. I know that that sort of decision must be made in the case of two spouses within the family. But we are talking not about someone totally removed from that relationship, but about a joint owner who, as a matter of principle, has accepted in the house some third party and almost certainly that third party's spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the Minister, but I want to develop my argument first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is wrong to say that circumstances may arise in which the opposition of, say, the brother who is a co-owner—he may even be a member of the same family—is dictated by a false loyalty to one end of the broken marriage and has little to do with social justice or a workable arrangement. There is a case for saying that we should leave the door open to allow an application to the courts in which the third party co-owner can make representations which the courts should look at carefully. No doubt it may be concluded that the personal relationships under that roof would be so fractured if he were landed with his brother's wife after the break-up of the marriage that it would be in no one's interest to proceed. A situation could be constructed in which the balance of the argument might be that a matrimonial occupancy right
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
should follow and would not be counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had to rely only on that rather unusual set of circumstances, I would retreat from this argument now. But, with his usual skill, the Minister has invited us to consider a situation in which the joint owner is resident in the house and will therefore be prejudiced since he will have to share the kitchen and bathroom as a joint facility with the estranged wife of his brother. The Minister says that such circumstances, not arrived at voluntarily but imposed by the courts, would be so unusual as not to justify the general departure from the principle which he enunciates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give another set of circumstances which will arise and which I would like the Minister to consider between now and Report. Under subsection (2) the situation may arise where there has been no waiver of occupancy rights but where the joint owner is not living in the house. I have had experience of this from my family in the case of an aunt—I hasten to say that there was no instance of matrimonial friction or any sort of problem. She was a lady who, properly, in my view, allowed another member of the family to live in the house but made it perfectly clear that she wished to maintain her right of occupancy, because she was working away from home in another town and intended to return in a few years to occupy the house. There would be no immediate prejudice—I now depart from the experience in my own family—in the sorts of circumstances to which we are referring in allowing an enforcement of an occupancy right which would allow the wife and children to stay in the house excluding the spouse, perhaps for good reasons, under clause 4. That occupancy right would in no way prejudice the third party's right of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third party may clearly have no intention of exercising his occupancy right, although he was not waiving it, perhaps for several years. In those circumstances, perhaps out of misplaced loyalty to the husband who is being excluded or for all sorts or reasons—family loyalty and so on—the third party, although he had no substantial social argument in terms of prejudice, might say "No, I am not waiving my occupancy rights, because I intend at some future date to exercise them. If I waive them, I know full well that that exclusion order is bound to go through because my brother would not have a hope and prayer of convincing the court that it was merely inequitable. I can stop it going through merely by not waiving my occupancy rights. Then, my sister-in-law, prejudiced and battered"—I take an extreme case—"cannot even go to the courts and request because under subsection (2) she is excluded."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am making heavy weather of this, but what I am saying is this. Surely there is a case for giving the exclusion and removing the words " 'entitled' spouse " where the third party co-owner is exercising an occupancy right—we derive that concept from phrases such as "if in occupation"—but for leaving the matter to the discretion of the court if it is claimed that occupancy rights are not being waived but are not being exercised. If we are fair, we can easily construct genuine situations which might arise where there would be a strong social argument for allowing an occupant the right to exist in the interests of everyone without any prejudice to the co-owner or the co-lessee, to whom we have referred as the third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that no distinction is drawn between the situation in which there has simply been no waiver and the more difficult situation in which there is actual exercise of occupancy rights. That split is worth considering, as there is great virtue in the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has, with great ingenuity put forward a possible scenario and a combination of circumstances where, although the third party did not wish to waive his occupancy rights, if the court had the discretion, if might come to the decision that the refusal to waiver occupancy rights which resulted from a misplaced sense of loyalty and not from genuine reasons which should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot discount the possibility that that might apply in a particular case, but the changes to the Bill which the hon Gentleman would like, could in no way be drafted to deal with just that tiny case without opening up a whole Pandora's box of discretion to the court which go far beyond that scenario. Even if we were to accept that in those circumstances it would not be unreasonable to allow an occupancy right to be enforced, the provision would nevertheless apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman has to accept that even in the case of his aunt or any other third party allowing a house to be occupied, there is some flexibility and if that third party is prepared to waive his occupancy rights, there would be no problem. However we are dealing with a situation in which they have been given the opportunity but are not prepared to exercise that. They may do that through confusion or misplaced loyalty or for other genuine reasons about which we can only speculate, but it is not reasonable to say that the court will have to look into that third party's motives for not waiving a right which he is perfectly entitled to insist upon, and that the occupancy rights should not be enforceable only if the courts decided that refusal to waive is reasonable. I think that is a fair onus to place when dealing with the rights of one spouse against another. By definition we are talking about an innocent third party who is not involved in the matrimonal problem, but is a member of the public who may or may not be related or who may be an elderly person who is in some confusion and says "I made a personal agreement with Mr. X that he should be able to live in the house for the time being. I made no agreement with Mrs. X and would certainly object to her being given an occupancy right and Mr. X being subject to an exclusion order from my house." I do not think that the court should be asked to examine the motives of innocent third parties for not choosing to exercise a right available to them under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to achieve fairness to spouses in dispute with one another. Once we begin imposing obligations upon third parties who may or may not be related to the husband and wife but who clearly have either a patrimonial interest or other title to the property in question, that goes beyond the legitimate scope of a reform of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are already contemplating an infringement of legal rights of ownership. A husband who may be the owner of a property will, for the first time, not
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
have the right to occupy his own home. The Law Commission felt that that was justified. However, I do not think that it is legitimate to go on to infringe the legal rights of third parties when they are not party to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a form of drafting which would apply to one or two cases where, in common sense, it might seem unreasonable not to allow a wife to enforce her occupancy right, there may be a case for saying that we should go beyond the principle and deal With that specific circumstance which might just arise once in a hundred times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon Gentleman is well aware that drafting cannot be devised in that way. Either the courts have discretion or they do not. If they have discretion, Parliament will have clearly indicated that the courts should be able to overrule the interest of a third party whenever they think it appropriate. That, in effect, is what it would amount to. If we frame the Bill in those terms it is not unreasonable for the courts to interpret it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not wish them to interpret it in that way, we must act accordingly. I shall give further thought to the general points raised during the debate, but I believe that if we go into the realms of prejudicing the rights of third parties who are not parties to the matrimonial dispute we shall reach dangerous ground. It is ground which we are seeking to withdraw from in other parts of the Bill for the very reasons that have been put so eloquently both here and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the hon Gentleman will not press his point. We shall look at the general issue involved, but I should be unhappy to introduce new prejudices to third parties who are not themselves parties to the dispute involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the Minister's remarks. This is an issue with a genuine need for discussion, and I can see why he cannot sound over-sympathetic at this stage. Like all Opposition spokesmen I shall clutch at the straw that he will look again at what has been said, although I do not regard that as particularly optimistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some merit in the difference between a third party who is occupying and a third party who is merely maintaining, by the negative process of not waiving an occupancy right. That is the basis of my distinction. I am not absolutely clear that the moral case that the Minister makes is right. After all, if I am away from a house which I own—the best of all occupancy rights for I own the place and quite clearly intend to return and occupy it at some future date-^ and if I give permission to Mr. X to occupy it, and come back and find to my great surprise that not Mr. X but Mrs. X is occupying it, that would be an infringement of my rights as owner. But it is one which I am prepared to countenance because of the need for social justice and the need to strike at the difficulties which the Bill is intended to meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Minister is describing a case where I am not the sole owner, but the joint owner With a half or pro indiviso share of ownership, but I permit someone else to live in the house. That other person also has a pro indiviso share, but when he has a quarrel with his wife and the wife says that she wants to occupy the house, despite all the good reasons which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
would normally allow me to succeed, if I find that the wife is barred because of the alleged prejudice to the pro indiviso proprietor who is not exercising an occupancy right, I am not convinced—I put it no higher— that there is a moral distinction of such obvious virtue as to justify a hard stance by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have perhaps ploughed this ground sufficiently long—given the list of amendments we have had to deal with. I shall be satisfied with the Minister's assurance that he will at least if he does not look at it himself get someone else to do so during the course of the next week or two, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is, understandably, dazzled by the very real success that he and his colleagues achieved during the course of the night when the Under-Secretary's ministerial colleague had to announce an instant change of plan on a matter of real importance because of the persuasive powers of my hon Friend. I fear, Mr. Henderson, that if I proceed with that topic you will rule me out of order, but it was a happening in which we should all rejoice, as should the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to an amendment of real importance and one on which there is a genuine difference of opinion among the numerous bodies interested in the passage of the Bill. Amendment No. 13 invites the Committee to remove from the Bill subsection (5) which provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A non-titled spouse may renounce in writing his or her occupancy rights, only—
	<ol>
	<li>in a particular matrimonial home; or</li>
	<li>in a particular property which it is intended by the spouses will become a matrimonial home."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is clearly a very important provision. We are here saying that at some point, perhaps many years before the wife—fbr the sake of this debate let us assume that it is the wife, as it will be 999 times out of 1,000—has any thoughts in her mind about the possibility of bitterness entering the marriage or of a breakdown, she may be invited for all sorts of reasons to sign a waiver on the matrimonial home. That means that, when bitterness has occurred and she is perhaps open to heavy prejudice, she will find that she has none of the important rights of occupancy and protection as regards the disposal of the property which would normally have been conferred upon her by this legislation if she had not signed the waiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any member of the Committee would disagree that these are rights which can be of
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
almost overwhelming importance in the reality of a broken marriage but which are likely to seem unimportant at the start of the marriage. Although I recognise the validity of the argument, I do not found my doubts—at the moment they are no more than doubts— about the need for this waiver clause on the case where violence has occurred. I know that the Women's Aid movement and a number of other interested expert bodies worry greatly about the possibility of a waiver being signed under duress. I am not ruling it out as a possibility, but 1 do not think that it is likely to happen on many occasions, although if it happens at all we must take it very seriously and see whether we can guard against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the situation that really worries me, which I think is much more important, is where the wife does not sign under duress but in ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to agree with the hon Gentleman. I do not think that the duress problem is a particularly serious one, but would it not be covered by common law anyway, if the consent had been obtained in circumstances of duress? Would the court not be in a position to set it aside? I am not disagreeing with the hon Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. It is what Lord Mansfield relied on in another place. If duress did occur, it would be an improperly obtained consent and it would be possible to overturn it in the courts. However, I am not too happy about that as the total answer. If one assumes that duress has been used successfully, in that position the wife might not appreciate what her legal rights were in terms of going to the courts. If she did, she might be frightened to exercise them anyway because the fear might be a continuing fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, there is a real problem with violence, but I do not want to dwell on it. There is a more important problem, which has not been put to me particularly by any interested group. If one assumes that a husband is sceptical about a life of married bliss and wishes to strengthen his position, I can envisage that he might go to his wife, who is not a woman used to the management of business, and say to her "I wonder, dear, if you would sign these papers". She might even say "What are they?" At that point he says "There is this one about the insurance policy, this one about the property" and so on, and she will accept that she is signing something that she is being asked to sign in good faith. In the course of signing it, she may surrender her rights under this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman will appreciate that the amendment would remove any right to renunciation. It is the next group of amendments which seeks to provide specific safeguards. He will be aware also that under subsection (6) the renunciation of rights, even in its present form, has to be before either a justice of the peace or a notary public. Indeed, the spouse who is renouncing her rights has to swear or affirm
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it was made freely and without coercion of any kind."</p></blockquote> Therefore, we are not simply dealing with a situation where a document is put in front of a spouse which she is invited to sign, and that is the end of it.

the swearing or affirmation by the non-titled spouse in the circumstances outlined. Therefore, it would be more appropriate for the hon Gentleman to consider it in that context rather than as simply one of numerous documents which a person is asked to sign without knowing what it is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. It is perhaps difficult to separate without wandering between these two groups of amendments. I have a fall-back position on this, in which I want to strengthen subsection (6). The Government are entitled to make a virtue of these safeguards, but they were not in the original Bill. Having said rude things about the other place and their Lordships, I ought to say that these safeguards upon which the Minister so disingenuously relies were not forced upon him—that is too rude a way of putting it—but were introduced into the Bill by the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I am saying is that, fair enough, one has to go before a notary public or a JP. Why on a later amendment I want the JP taken out is that I believe that JPs often do not appreciate the significance. They are merely assenting to the fact that the signature is that of the person who is signing. They cannot put up any defence to a woman who is unwisely doing something because she does not appreciate its significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not presupposing that the husband is a wicked man. I am afraid that many husbands would see it as natural that the property should be theirs and under their control. Some of us have no doubt been guilty of that, although I think that more and more of us are aware of what is right and just. If one searches the register of sasines, for example, one will find that an enormous number of matrimonial homes are still bought and put in the husband's name alone. That is not because he beats his wife or because he imagines that in three or four years he will run away with his fancy woman and try to remove all the property assets of the marriage. It is merely a somewhat narrow, restricted and perhaps reactionary view of what the balance should be within a marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, one might well get a husband who wanted the title in his own name and decided that the title in his own name should be as good a title as he could give himself. The surrender of occupancy rights might be part of that process. I do not defend that. I think that it would be a totally wrong attitude to adopt, but we have to deal with human nature. We should at least cater for that situation and take that social attitude into account when we consider the drafting of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the tenancy of council homes is very often in the name of the husband only and that in fact not enough encouragement is given by the local authority for both husband and wife to have the tenancy jointly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is 100 per cent, right. I expect that he will want to contribute to the debate on clause 12, when we shall raise that major matter. My general point is that there could be a situation in which a waiver could be signed and the spouse did not appreciate its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
I want to take the argument a stage further. If we assume that there is a danger that something like that could occur, we may still have to live with it because of the importance of this waiver. There are circumstances that will arise more commonly than the dangers to which I have referred and for which we must cater by including in the Bill the possibility of a waiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought quite hard about this and I have had the advantage of reading the debates in the other place. The Earl of Mansfield addressed himself to this point, and I thought that he produced some rather thin examples of a situation in which there was a discretionary trust or, let us say, parents of one of the parties to a marriage who wanted to buy the matrimonial home but were anxious that the title should be in the hands of their child in order to defeat any possibility of the other party in the marriage interfering in any way with ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether that is a likely scenario. My experience of in-laws is that they are anxious to give the gift to the happy couple. It does not occur to the parents, any more than to the happy couple, that in a few years' time the couple may be an unhappy couple with problems over matrimonial property. In any event, even if that possibility occurs to them, I am not sure that it is an attitude that I want to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is a matter of trust law—I am not an expert, nor am I familiar with this—and of discretionary trusts, I suspect that there are other ways in which this could be tied up by specific deed to meet those circumstances. I am not satisfied that a general waiver that might be open to the kind of abuse that I described earlier and suggested was a possibility is a danger worth running if there are other ways of meeting the point that may arise in the perhaps rather unusual circumstances of setting up of some form of family trust or life rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because I thought that it was worth running. My instinct—I put it no higher than that as I have a fairly open mind—is that there will be a debit balance whichever way we swing. There is case for saying that we might be better without the power to sign a waiver, as one might say, in anticipation. There might be a case for doing without that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that in the break-up of a marriage the wife will have the right to exercise, or to make an application for, an occupancy right. It does not mean that when the house is sold the wife will have to give her consent. Perhaps some would argue—I see the justice of this in this in the same way that I argue that one might get a wife prejudiced by a thoughtless act early in the marriage long before any stress emerged— that a husband might be prejudiced by a vindictive wife in a broken marriage. For example, she might refuse to give consent to a sale or might unreasonably try to exercise an occupancy right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second case, specific powers are granted to the courts that ought to ensure that an occupancy right would not be prejudicial to the exercise against an owner —the husband, in this example. If one assumes that the good sense of the courts is not sufficient protection, one is giving a substantial vote of no confidence to the whole basis on which the Bill will operate. I am sure that the Minister would not like to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is presupposing that the consent to sale, for example, would be unreasonably withheld, I do not think that the provisions of clause 7 suggest that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
is any danger of that. I have tabled amendments because I believe that the present criteria that would allow the withholding of consent are too slim. For example, the suggestion that to waive the consent of a spouse if he or she
	<br><blockquote><p>"has led the titled spouse to believe that he or she would consent to the dealing; or"</p></blockquote>
that two written requests a fortnight apart have not been responded to shall be prima facie grounds for waiving consent seems to suggest that the idea that one can withhold consent in a situation where it was prejudicial to the other spouse is probably not a substantial or serious danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to convince my hon Friend the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I know that his instincts in the matter will be sound. It is perhaps the moral perceptions of the Minister which arc worrying me more here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the Minister has not been following—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear it. What I am suggesting as an introduction—so that we can test the water and hear what other members of the Committee have to say—is that the possibility of violence and, moreover, the possibility of the whole considered renunciation at an early stage in the marriage, are very real if the waiver power remains. It does not seem to me that the specific examples where it is necessary could not be accommodated by some other form of legal mechanism. Therefore, the general dangers of leaving to the non-operation of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill situations where it might really be needed are sufficient to outweigh the convenience of putting in the general waiver. The fact that the waiver would have to be consent only when the property was being disposed of does not seem, in view of clause 7, to be a matter which ought to give the Committee great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I moved the amendment in a slightly tentative mood. There are arguments on both sides. I first thought that I would not table the amendment, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought that there was a serious case for considering whether we were importing genuine difficulties and dangers into the Bill in order to avoid difficulties and specialised situations which would be best coped with in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene briefly in this dialogue between the Minister and the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to ask the Minister a question. I may have misunderstood the interrelation of this subsection with clauses 6 and 7, but, unlike the hon Member for Garscadden, I am concerned not with a devious scheming husband, but with circumstances in which the marriage is proceeding happily and the only asset is the matrimonial home. For business reasons the husband may need to raise a loan on the house. I can think of examples where this has occurred. In those circumstances the person giving the loan will want to ensure that the security for the loan —the house—is as unencumbered as possible. He might require the wife to renounce her occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marriage may be happy at the time and the wife may have no suspicions and the husband may have no
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
mischievous or devious intention. If the security for the loan should be realised, clauses 6 and 7 would come into play. I am concerned not about that, but about what might happen, say, 10 years later when the husband has redeemed the loan and the security which he had to grant has been lifted, but the waiver which the wife gave freely, and with the best intentions, still stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine that aspect carefully. If there is no way round the problem, my instinct would be to say "That is just too bad".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon Friend's valid point would be met by the terms of the waiver. The terms of the waiver could be restricted explicitly for such duration as is required to meet the business requirement of the husband.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the points to which 1 was about to come. One could get over the problem that I have posited by ensuring that it was a waiver of limited effect or duration. The law should be capable, even without express statutory statement, of dealing with that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman suggesting that a husband can demand that his wife give him a waiver? If he wants to raise money on the house for business purposes, surely he should not do so unless his wife agrees, and there should be no need for a formal waiver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The situation that I am suggesting— I do not think that it is wholly impractical—is that someone lending the money to the husband might say "If I am going to lend you this money, I shall require the security of your house. I am aware of the provisions in clauses 6 and 7, but that might mean that I would have to go to the court. I now want a waiver under this subsection." At that time, in the circumstances that I am positing, the wife gives it willingly, because she sees that in their collective interest it is advantageous that the husband should be granted the loan so that his business can develop. There might be a subsequent change of circumstances but the waiver will still stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind) is correct in saying that one could get over this difficulty with a waiver limited in either time or purpose. But I believe that we should look at the point now, because it presents a practical problem Which could genuinely arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so sure that I can think of a renunciation or waiver with a time limit on it, but I should have thought that there should be an opportunity to allow for a waiver or renunciation for a limited purpose, so that, when circumstances alter, the occupancy right re-asserts itself.

I hope that I am. right there. We should explore this subject to ensure that an intolerable problem is not created by failing to examine it at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fascinating listening to these legal eagles flying high in Committee. I cannot match them. I approach these matters from the point of view of the layman, and I am in danger of sounding like the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). I shall not dwell on that aspect. I shall move on quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is subsection (5)(a) in the Bill at all? For the sake of laymen on the Committee and many more outside, will the Minister explain why the Government felt it necessary to include the power of waiver of occupancy rights in the Bill, notwithstanding the safeguards in subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke of the waiver being used in circumstances before the breakdown of marriage and the loss of the wife's rights under the Bill if she signed the waiver. I thought that all his points were valid. I am sure that there is considerable interest outside the House in obtaining answers to these questions. I, too, have read the briefs from Women's Aid and others and I appreciate what they say about signing under duress, although I had some difficulty in following the point made by the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and by my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden that signing under duress did not seem so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I misunderstood the hon Gentleman. I thought that both hon Gentlemen said that the point did not seem as important as signing in ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Less common, probably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is less common. Notwithstanding the safeguards in subsection (6), I think that signing under duress is likely to be a problem. There is a real risk particularly with signatures before a justice of the peace. I do not wish to anticipate the amendment dealing with that point, Mr. Henderson, but I shall want to say something about it. Like many hon Members, I have had experiences regarding the role of the justice of the peace, and I am not clear why we are importing it into the Bill. We shall come to that point shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am simply saying that it worries me, because I do not think that it amounts to a safeguard. That leaves my point that signing in ignorance is a distinct possibility. If we are to have the right to renounce in subsection (5), I want the safeguards to be made much stronger than they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the comments of the hon Member for South Angus about waivers. I shall not return to his point, but I have a layman's point on which I hope that the Minister can satisfy me. Who draws up the terms of the waiver, and can they be varied? Will they be as varied as there are notaries public and justices of the peace? How do we arrive at the terms of a waiver? Is there a statute somewhere that lays down the form of words to be used? I am con
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
cerned if the forms of words are to be as many and varied as there are firms of lawyers and justices of the peace. I hope that the Minister will answer my points, notwithstanding the fine legal points made by the hon Member for Garscadden, in language which I and other hon Members will understand, because of the interest that has been expressed to me by women's organisations and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Committee would like to welcome back the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) from his state of SOS—sleeping off success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have grave reservations about this subsection. I apologise for being out of the Committee for some time. Indeed, I may have missed some important speeches. I take it that we are dealing with the right of a non-titled spouse to renounce occupancy rights. Only a little while ago it struck me that we were talking about ownership rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occupancy rights pose a different kind of problem. I do not think that the matter is sufficiently safeguarded by a renunciation or waiver having to be signed in front of a justice of the peace. I take the view of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that a justice of the peace merely witnesses that the right person signs. He witnesses the correctness of the signature and plays no other part. It may be different with a notary public or a lawyer. However, I can visualise a situation in which the husband may have persuaded the wife—in most cases the husband would be culpable in this respect—and have everything cut and dried before going to the lawyer, or whoever is to witness the signing. But the duress is still there and it would be difficult to prove otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the necessity to prove duress in other legal matters, but with a husband and wife it is not right to rely on the necessity to prove that no duress occurred, since pressure could be applied in subtle ways. I do not know whether this is true of lawyers, but Members of Parliament certainly tend to imagine that when they set out to debate legislation they do so in a totally neutral atmosphere. I do not think that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some very evil people in this world. While the husband may not be evil to start with, some difficulties may occur between him and his wife which lead him to adopt a hard and unfair position. He might exert strong pressure on her to sign away her right of occupancy. That would take away from the wife the right to remain in that dwelling unless she could prove that she signed under duress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister said that in most cases the husband would be the culprit, if I may use the word in that way. If we are trying to protect a woman from the entrenched privileges which the male seems to have in our society, especially with regard to the family home, we should fall over backwards to protect the woman and not give the husband, who has developed into an evil being, a green light to effect some dastardly purpose, which would deny his wife the right of occupancy of the family home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is unnecessary if we are serious in assuming that it is nearly always the wife who is affected and the husband who is guilty. Of course, the situation would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
be the same if that were the other way round, but life suggests clearly that the woman usually suffers. We are denying her a right which she ought to have and watering down provisions which would protect her from a situation which might develop at some time in her marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, was worried about this clause, but the more that I listened to the arguments today the more it struck me that one of the arguments in favour of having such a clause was that there are circumstances in which the husband will want to protect the property, for reasons such as those given by the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). Unless there is such a clause, other means outside the Bill will have to be found to achieve that object. I think that it is dangerous to allow the purpose of the Bill to be circumvented because we have removed the one possible way that the Bill affords for doing that in a fairly restricted and carefully qualified way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I think about it, the more it strikes me that it is not simply a question of asking a JP to witness a signature. The renouncer is being asked either to take an oath or to affirm, which, as the hon Member for Garscadden will know from his court practice, involves the physical act of raising a hand and speaking certain words. That may seem very small, but it would indicate to the person taking the oath—swearing, as the Bill says —or affirming that he was undertaking something serious and there would be no question of simply going to a JP, his witnessing a signature, and that being an end of it. By doing it in this way, although there are dangers, I believe that we are achieving within the Bill the safeguard that I hope will prevent the circumvention of the Bill and avoid the dangers of which hon Members have spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to keep the Committee long, but I should like to make a small comment in response to the serious-minded contribution by the hon Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) who was probably basing some of his comments on a real concern arising from cases that had come to his notice through his medical experience. From my past experience, I can think of cases that accord with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point that I wish to make before the Minister replies is that there is a slight danger that we might look at the matter in too sexist a way. Of course, we must be concerned about the woman who, by devious or subtle means, may be persuaded into renunciation when she does not fully understand what is going on. The Law Commission took a rather broader approach. In paragraph 2.77 it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, money may be provided by a wife's family for the purchase of a matrimonial home but on condition that the husband prospectively renounces his occupancy rights on a general basis. We think that in such circumstances a general renunciation should be obtainable."</p></blockquote>
The example that the Law Commission had in mind was the one we used to see in banner headlines in the popular press—"Deb marries dustman"—when it became apparent that the parents of the deb did not want to see their little darling going into some bleak house that the dustman could provide but were minded
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
to give them a rather greater financial boost on condition that the property was clearly in the wife's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the parties freely and willingly enter into marriage on that basis and the parents set up such an arrangement, so be it. It is not for the law to impede their progress to happiness, if that is how they want to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of the hon Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) of happiness and the proper attitude of parents-in-law seems highly questionable. Giving him credit for the fact that he is merely defending this extraordinary scenario on the ground that the law should not stop people doing peculiar things if they want to do peculiar things, will he please address himself to the point that, in order to accommodate these highly unusual circumstances—I suggest that in many ways they are rather undesirable circumstances—he is putting in a general waiver that may lead to the kind of abuses that Women's Aid worries about and to which I referred? Will he also address himself to the rather more ingenious but valid point that his hon Friend the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) adduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pollock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Garscadden should not be alarmed into thinking that I have adopted such a philosophy of life. I stoutly defend either charge made by the hon Member for East Kilbride. There are couples who choose to enter into the bonds of matrimony one being a dustman and the other being a deb. It is not for us to make it any more difficult for them to get to that stage than it must already be. It is in that light that I invite the Minister to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If 1 were to follow the example that my hon Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) has suggested to the Committee, it might at least explain the original phraseology of titled and non-titled spouses in a way that was rather more obvious that we had previously realised. I do not intend to expound unduly on my hon Friend's example as a basis for the provision, although it may be relevant to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with the basic point—I do not think that the Committee has appreciated it yet—that, if we accepted the amendment of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and simply deleted this part of the clause, far from that being in the interests of the spouse, it would have the opposite effect. If there was no reference anywhere in the Bill to rights of renunciation, under common law it would be possible and appropriate, if the parties so wished, for them to enter into any form or renunciation—completely open-ended, without safeguards, without requirement for a notary public, without requirement for swearing or affirmation, and without reference to the waiver being in respect of a particular matrimonial home. In common law, nothing can stop a wife saying that she does not wish to exercise statutory rights and the court would be obliged to take that into account if at some future date an application for enforcement of occupancy rights were before it. I am not saying that such a waiver would be totally binding, but if the court believed that a wife had without duress two or three years before signed a document saying that she would in no circumstances want to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
enforce her occupancy rights it would have to take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the subsection, far from being to restrict the rights of the non-entitled spouse, was put in for the opposite purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Garscadden may be surprised at that, but I think that he has appreciated the point that, in the absence of any safeguard, that is exactly what the position would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was considered appropriate to specify the circumstances in which rights could be renounced. When this was discussed in another place, the original restriction, which had safeguards but which nevertheless allowed a spouse to renounce her rights in respect of any matrimonial home, was considered unduly wide. Therefore the amendment was accepted which restricted that waiver to a specific matrimonial home in the form that appears in the Bill. This provision is meant to have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with two general areas of argument, both of which are relevant. First, there are specific examples, such as that put forward, quite properly, by my hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) where such a waiver might be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from those specific examples which my hon Friend and other hon Members have mentioned, there is the general principle that when dealing with two spouses, is it the business of the law, of Parliament or of an Act of Parliament to forbid these two to reach an agreement at a certain stage, of their own free will and choice, about the exercise of their rights? It is proper for Parliament to insist that certain safeguards are introduced to ensure that the exercise of rights is genuinely free and entered into without duress in the procedure laid down by a Bill. But to say that in no circumstances, irrespective of whether the parties fully understand the situation, irrespective of whether it is a completely free choice, irrespective of whether there has been duress, irrespective of whether it was put before a justice of the peace or notary public or whether they went through all the necessary procedure, should a party be permitted to waive an occupancy right is an unwise and unacceptable proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Garscadden said only a few minutes ago that the waiver by a third party should not be considered necessarily to be sacrosanct. Third parties are to be permitted to waive their rights, as has been mentioned—no one disagrees that they should have this right. The hon Gentleman accepts that, and it is highly desirable that that should happen in a number of cases—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —as he affirms. Therefore, as long as the wife understands what she is doing, there has been no duress, there is a proper procedure and there are safeguards, there is no legitimate reason why Parliament should forbid an adult to exercise his own discretion to waive his rights in particular circumstances. As my hon Friend the Member for South Angus said, in certain circumstances it makes obvious sense to wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for South Angus asked
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
whether the terms of any waiver could be restricted to the specific purpose for which the waiver was sought. There is nothing in this Bill or anywhere else to prevent that. I see no reason why a waiver could not be expressed in terms in which the wife undertook not to press her occupancy rights for as long as, and until, the sums being borrowed on the security of the house had been repaid, and that thereafter such a waiver would not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can help me. Is there not a difference between a waiver of the sort that he is discussing and a renunciation—the word used in the Bill? So far as I am aware, a renunciation in law is a more permanent feature than a waiver, which can be conditional.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, no. It is a question of terminology, obviously. But a renunciation is subject to such conditions or qualifications as are laid out in the renunciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I say "I formally renounce the exercise of my rights for the next six months", that is a renunciation for the next six months; if I renounce my rights indefinitely, that is an indefinite renunciation. I do not think that a renunciation stops being a renunciation simply because it is said in advance that it will apply for a period only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may wish to renounce my rights in respect of a particular property. Because I have renounced my rights in respect only of the house that I am living in, as opposed to a house in which I might live in the future, it does not stop being a renunciation. The wording of the clause now only permits renunciation in respect of a particular home—not in respect of matrimonial homes generally. It still remains a renunciation, even if qualified—whether for a particular matrimonial home, or for a particular duration, or for a particular purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) asked whether there was any restriction on the form or wording of a waiver. There is no such restriction. Waivers can be made under common law now. If there were any dispute about the terms, the meaning or the significance of the waiver, that would be for the court to interpret and to reach a view about the implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could rightly be a proper debate about the safeguards that should be introduced to ensure that the parties are not duped and that there has been no duress. The Government have introduced certain safeguards into the clause, and there may be room for improvement in them. I do not stand on them now, because we are not debating them. Here we are debating whether there should be a right of waiver or renunciation, assuming that all the safeguards have been met and that all has been complied with, and whether at the end of the day the spouse should be entitled, at her own free choice, to undertake in advance not to exercise her rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that under no circumstances should that be permitted is, I believe, an unnecessary rigidity which would present problems of the kind suggested by my hon Friend and would be undesirable in principle. I can see no reason of principle why adults exercising their free will and free choice in a matter relevant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
only to themselves should not be able to show their preferences and seek to make their intentions clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can properly discuss the safeguards which can be applied to make sure that the free choice is genuine, that the waiver is understood and that a proper statutory procedure is complied with to prevent any basic injustice. That is a proper public and parliamentary interest, but I do not believe that it would be right to contemplate rigid refusal of the exercise of the free rights of the individual—with the safeguards that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I am not entirely convinced by the Minister's display of Tory principle. I think that he has somewhat misinterpreted what I said about waivers by third parties. I was then arguing that the failure to exercise a waiver should not inevitably and fundamentally prejudice the rights of a spouse under the Bill. That is perhaps another argument which I do not want to follow here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the difference between a waiver and a renunciation was "a matter of terminology"—I think that was his phrase. T suggest that it is a matter of meaning, and one that he will have to look at seriously within the narrow ambit of that point. If the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has in som&—and I hope many—years to come to decide whether he will renounce a peerage, there is no doubt that most of us understand that, when he renounces that peerage, that is it. He cannot come back two or three years later and say "I said under my breath that it was only for five years".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is because the Act which permits my hon Friend to make that choice makes it clear that that is the effect of a renunciation. It can only be once and for all. But the fact that the Act provides for my hon Friend's heir, ultimately, to have a second opportunity to make a similar choice implies that the renunciation which my hon Friend might or might not make one day would not be absolutely finite in terms of the title to which it applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know, the hon Gentleman is blessed with daughters and not sons, so, unless he keeps trying, that may be a somewhat academic consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon Member will bear in mind that the clause is about occupancy rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Henderson. On that basis, I was about to put a point to the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) in order to help him. In terms or renunciation and its effects, there are many cases in which, for tax purposes, inheritances are renounced. They are renounced in perpetuity. One cannot renounce in order to get over the problem at that time, and then take it back again later. I agree that it is a matter not simply of terminology, but of meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the Minister will want to look upon this, because he may not be impressed by my prejudiced efforts from the Opposition side of the Committee, but as a "humble solicitor" I would not wish to quarrel with the massive expertise of the Scottish Bar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the balance of convenience. I do not believe that this is a matter of immense principle and—although this could be argued—that it would be wrong to say that no one should be allowed to bar himself or herself from a waiver because it is an infringement of freedom of contract which ought to be sacred. That is not a good piece of Tory philosophy. It might horrify the Minister to hear that I did not spend the entire night in the Chamber, but I spent much of it reading the life of the distinguished Tory philosopher, the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Shaftesbury spent much of his life infringing the law of freedom of contract because he argued constantly that in some situations the right to freedom of contract could not be sacred because people had to be protected against their own naivety and innocence. He argued that they might contract to put themselves in a situation in which they would be severely prejudiced and that the law ought to protect them from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take a fundamental example—I believe that it is relevant as an analogy. The whole basis of the Factories Acts allows for interference in what Tories at that time would have viewed as an absolutely sacred right—the freedom of a master and a man to make a contract that suited themselves on an arm's length basis. The principle of the Factories Acts was that that should not be permitted, and we had to legislate to limit that contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to take the Minister's argument that it was wrong to bind someone into the provisions of this Bill whether they wanted to be bound or not, that would be an argument for saying that no one should be allowed to contract out of unfair dismissal provisions. We say that no one should be allowed to contract out of those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to go along to the hon Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) and say that I wanted a job as a handyman in his garden, we agreed terms, and the hon Gentleman said "All right, I shall take you, but I have a great horror of those tribunals which seem an enormous infringement of employers' rights, so I am putting a clause in your contract saying that, whatever happens, you will not take an action for unfair dismissal against me and you will abrogate for all time your rights under employment legislation", that clause would clearly be inoperative and could not be put into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is arguably the same sort of situation. People enter into matrimony and, at that time, the last thing on their minds is that they might end up in the courts disputing property or occupancy rights. On that basis, casually or in naive optimism, they might sign away rights which would become vital safeguards not only to themselves but—and this is a very important point—to their children still unborn. If there is a waiver to an occupancy right under this clause at the start of the marriage when there are no children, that waiver will bind the children when we come to the point where everyone is regretting that we cannot use the machinery that we are putting on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
I believe that these are points of importance. I do not accept the point of principle that the Minister, very persuasively as always, has tried to erect. There are many occasions when we have said that the freedom to contract will be limited, because we are saying that certain provisions should not be valid in a contract because they may be so prejudicial. The point about the children is a fair one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the specific point about the children, although I am sure the hon Gentleman does not mean this, he phrased the remark in a way that implied that children were given rights under the Bill. That is incorrect. No rights are given to the children. The only rights are given to spouses. Therefore, the person considering whether he wished to waive his rights would be the person whose rights were being influenced. The hon Gentleman's remark seemed to create the impression that children who might not yet be born would have their rights removed because of the actions of one of the spouses. That cannot happen, nor would it be desirable for it to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I think that the Minister follows my argument. If I expressed it in a slipshod way, I apologise. The argument that I am making is simply this. The spouse may sign a waiver under this subsection. That is a waiver that in 10 or 15 years' time she may bitterly regret, as she paces the streets waiting for the local authority to put her into bed and breakfast accommodation under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act. But the Minister is saying that that is just too bad, because, in the sacred principle of not interfering with people's rights to contract, she is the fool who signed the contract. But there may be trailing along behind her three children, who may have no rights as individuals under this piece of legislation but who bulk very large in the theory of this legislation. It is clear that what is right and just for the children will weigh very heavily with courts when they are considering an exclusion order or a declarator of occupancy under clauses 4 and 3 respectively
The great problem of matrimonial break-up very often is the children. That is what makes it so difficult and so heart-breaking, and that is what often puts the courts in such a dilemma. I am perfectly entitled to say that children might well be prejudiced by a waiver. If they could have gone to court under the Bill, their plight and the difficulty of their situation might have convinced the court overwhelmingly that an order should be made. But, because of the waiver made by the wife, the children's plight becomes totally irrelevant: the house is in the husband's name, and there is no machinery to accommodate the children within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) put his point elegantly in a slightly 1950-ish headline about the deb and the dustbin man. Nevertheless it is a serious point that was taken up by the Scottish Law Commission. In those circumstances one could argue precisely the other way round—that the best interests of children who emerged subsequent to the marriage would be protected if the parents-in-law were to provide a stable matrimonial
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
property in which that husband and wife could bring up their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I understand what the hon Gentleman is saying, he cannot argue that in every set of circumstances it necessarily follows that the right to renounce means that the children of the marriage 	<i>y/ill</i> lose out. In the example that my hon Friend gave and the Law Commission developed, it would be to the benefit of any children emerging that the renunciation had been made at the outset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in that point, because, very conveniently, I was just coming on to this example. The hon Member for Pentlands said— I think that I paraphrase him reasonably fairly—that he would not want to found on what the hon Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) had said. But, given the general anxiety about the waiver, one has to produce concrete examples of why a waiver is necessary. The Minister said that he would not found on the example given by the hon Member for Moray and Nairn, but he did not give any examples himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman wants an example, I can give him a real one. This is not biographical. I am not anxious to swap legal anecdotes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens—and this summer it will happen again—is that a pretty young Scots girl will go off to Majorca for a sunny holiday and meet a delightful Spanish waiter, Manuel. Things take their course. She returns home three or four weeks later. He comes over to Scotland and a marriage follows. In the hon Member's constituency it might be described as a "haftie" marriage. In those circumstances, the parents, having a respectable and nice daughter who has married a Spanish waiter and being well aware of the cultural differences between them, might provide a house for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Garscadden might regard that as a highly speculative example, but I assure him that 1 am aware of such a case. It is disguised to protect the innocent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with sympathy, but also with some scepticism, to what the hon Gentleman said. Let us examine what the hon Member for Pentlands said. He said that he would not rely on these scenarios— the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) seems to be having some sort of paroxysm—but he has not produced any examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Earl of Mansfield, reported in col. 1074 of the Official Report, House of Lords of 24 March, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree with him"—</p></blockquote>
an earlier speaker—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the circumstances in which, for instance, it might be in a wife's best interests to renounce would be rare."</p></blockquote>
He then goes on to give the only example that he can think of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where a wife's family, presumably with means, buys her and her fiance or husband a house but wants to make jolly certain that the son-in-law does not have any rights in that house in the future, and where, if they were not sure, they would riot produce their cash to buy the house."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 24 March 1981; Vol. 418, cc. 1074-5.]</p></blockquote>
Is that the kind of social judgment that is to justify the waiver? I get extremely suspicious. We are saying
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here is the extraordinary circumstance where a son-in-law is such an object of suspicion that his parents-in-law want to make jolly sure that he has no rights in the house". If that is the only example that the Government can produce to justify the waiver—despite the laughter I make a serious point—that seems the flimsiest of reasons.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Known as the case of the Spanish waiver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is better than the war of Jenkins' ear. It will happen in Warrington, I suppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only concrete example that has been produced by the Government and by the Earl of Mansfield in another place, by the hon Member for Pentlands and repeated by the hon Member for Moray and Nairn. Paragraph 2.77 of the Law Commission's report says that although it was a matter for anxious consideration whether a spouse should have the power of renunciation and waiver, the reason why it decided
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
that it should exist is based on one example only, and that is the example that I have just quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example turns up every time that we stir the pot. This is the piece of doubtful social flotsam that comes to the surface. When we consider the general arguments and the genuine fears that abound, if that is the only kind of situation in which a waiver is in people's best interests, I despair. After all, it is not necessarily a situation that cannot be accommodated in other ways. If the suspicion of the son-in-law is so deep-rooted, why not keep the title in the parents' name and merely give a right of occupancy to the wife? That would cover it. We should not allow a general right of waiver to appear in the legislation that might be open to abuse through ignorance, lack of proper consideration or violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
