	<p>[Mr. JOHN HUNT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed.
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Alexander Fletcher.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. There does not seem to be available a list of the amendments that will be considered after the sittings motion. Can the list be made available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be arranged immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a second point of order, Mr. Hunt. As you will be aware, a Special Standing Committee has been considering the Warnock report, on the English Education Bill. Is it possible for the Official Report of the proceedings of that Standing Committee to be made available, as well as the Warnock report, copies of which the Minister has kindly provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That request will be noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I have placed on the Table the consultative paper on information for parents and also a bound folder of notes on clauses, now covering the entire Bill, which I hope will be of some assistance to members of the Committee in our debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving us that assistance, although we hope that he has not provided it in anticipation of our reaching the later clauses of the Bill earlier than reasonable treatment of the legislation requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the reasons why the sittings motion was stabled are not quite what they might have appeared to be. The future of the Government is, to say the least, uncertain. Last night's vote suggests to us that this may well be the last legislation that the Government will be able to ram through before their ultimate demise. We would not wish to help them in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also recognise that the complexion of the Committee may change at any time. I see that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) has just entered the Committee Room. I am surprised to see that he is sitting on the Conservative Benches. After last night's vote we thought that he might have joined others in crossing the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have arrived just when the hon Member was making his comments about the vote last night. I can assure the hon Gentleman that I am a Conservative, that I am proud to be a Conservative, and that I will continue to be a Conservative so long as I serve in this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I recognise the emotion produced by last night's events, but we must now turn our attention to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hunt, if I strayed, but you will appreciate that this is a matter of some concern to us. We always assumed that at some stage in the life of the Bill, or perhaps the life of the Parliament, the loyalty of the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East would be rewarded by translation to another place. We felt that many of the noble Lords would welcome his company. We realise that now that he has voted against the Government the hon Gentleman's chances of ever being given a peerage are zero. We also appreciate that the pugilistic Whip opposite—the tyrant of the Right—is not likely to forget that act of gross disloyalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Must we discuss last night's vote, when we should be discussing the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. I have already ruled that we must discuss the sittings motion. I allowed a little latitude, in view of Committee members feelings, but I insist that we return to the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we are grateful to the Minister for providing copies of the notes on clauses. We expect that we shall have plenty of time to read them. Unfortunately, it appears that, if the motion is carried, the time that we shall have to read them will be mainly in Committee. We are concerned about the amount of time that we shall be spending in Committee during very busy parliamentary schedule. Many Committee members have a variety of responsibilities, both in the House and towards our constituents. Therefore, the amount of time that we spend here will detract from the service which we can provide for our constitutents. At the same time it will probably mean that we are not able to give the Bill the attention that it requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the third sittings motion on which I have spoken this year, and I find that the same arguments have arisen. The strength of the case against the motion is evident for all to see, apart from Government Ministers who are helping to push through the legislation. In this instance, we shall have to consider the nature of this complex legislation, which seeks to amend the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The Bill is a compendious document, covering all aspects of Scottish education, and it is not the easiest legislation to come to grips with. The Bill is, in effect, an insert to the 1980 Act. We are not expecting a Bill from the Government to be attractive reading, but it does not make easy reading, and so we feel that it should be taken very slowly and carefully and not in the manner in which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Minister seeks to railroad the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires a great deal of consideration, not just by the House, but by a whole plethora of pressure groups within Scotland. This morning Labour Members, had the opportunity of an all-too-brief discussion with the chairman of COSLA. Our consultation was of necessity very brief, because he came down from Scotland. We met him at 10 o'clock and we had only about 25 minutes with him. People have to come to London to speak to us, because we do not have time to meet them in Scotland. We must be down here for most of the week. We do not have easy access, as English Members would have, to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, and similar bodies, which are based in London. Therefore, those of us who feel obliged to undertake extensive consultations about the legislation are in considerable difficulty when we are required to meet as frequently as the Minister suggests in the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation lies at the heart of the case. We have already entered into discussions with groups such as the Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council about the parents' charter. The latter group has made fairly copious and, in some instances, well-argued points about the legislation. My speech is falling on deaf ears. I knew that the Government Whip was a mute individual, but he appears also to be deaf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a responsible Opposition, we have an obligation to listen to Scottish opinion. I use the term "responsible Opposition" because it is clear that the Government listen to very few people in Scotland. We feel that we should meet as many groups as possible to consider with them their views on this important legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already met the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, the Scottish Consumer Council, the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association and the Educational Institute of Scotland. We have now received representations from one of the parliamentary advisers to the National and Local Government Officers Association, and we have heard from societies that assist children who have hearing problems and from groups concerned with mental health and the mentally handicapped. Furthermore, some of us are trying to visit institutions that could be affected by the legislation. We consider that our meetings play an important part in equipping us to deal with the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the Minister has the full weight of the State machine behind him and that the Scottish Education Department is always ready to give him any document that may assist him in his arguments; on occasions those documents assist him considerably. However, we are not given that sort of back-up, so we must go into the highways and byways of Scotland to obtain information. I repeat that if we are in Scotland doing that, we are not down here carrying out the other tasks which are required of us as responsible Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for us to travel to and from Scotland fairly quickly. For example, shuttles leave almost hourly from Glasgow, and every two hours from Edinburgh. We can also have early morning meetings
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
and ask groups whether they will see us anywhere that is available so that discussions can take place. But it is always embarrassing to have to brush off those who may have devoted their lives to matters covered by the legislation with a 35-minute meeting—for instance, one is always looking at one's watch so as not to miss the plane or train to London. Therefore, consultation—which we consider lies at the very heart of the Bill—is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only does the sittings motion make it more difficult for us to equip ourselves to consider the legislation, but it affects the treatment of the Bill. If we have to sit here for 10, 15 or perhaps 20 hours a week, we must undertake a lot of work in order to frame our amendments. With the best will in the world, no legislation is perfect. Even if we were to agree with it, we are conscious that the Amendment Paper is littered with Government drafting amendments, so there are many errors. Once or twice we have found spelling mistakes as well, but we do not wish to be too pedantic about that. My hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was only a mathematics teacher, and was not therefore very concerned with spelling mistakes. But some of us who had other preoccupations in the classroom were conscious of the need to improve it. The legislation, even judged by the Government's own actions, is not perfect, and we must consider each amendment seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Government for providing us with the copious notes through which we shall now have to struggle. They will have to be digested and set against the amendments which the pressure groups have asked us to put forward on the matters about which they are unhappy. We shall doubtless have to see these groups yet again. The difficulty that will arise through these extended consultations is that it will undermine our service to our constituents in other respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not speaking from a partisan Labour point of view. There are four Government Members here who are members of the Scottish Select Committee—the hon Members for Aberdeenshire, East, for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart), for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) and for Galloway (Mr. Lang)—as is my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). The work involved in that Committee is considerable, and much attention is paid in Scotland to its activities. I have here a copy of the Glasgow Herald—which I have not yet had an opportunity to read because of my consultations this morning with a friend from COSLA—which I am sure gives extensive coverage of the Select Committee's proceedings yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee has considerable political import in Scotland. Its activities are followed with great care by Scottish people. There are innumerable television programmes showing members trooping in and out of the meetings. The proceedings cannot be shown, because a Select Committee is a Committee of the House, and parliamentary affairs cannot yet be televised apart from the State Opening of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee has attracted much interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
We know that the Secretary of State is concerned about it. I know that the Under-Secretary, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) has taken great care to follow up some of its recommendations. Ironically, the recommendations on inward investment were those of the Labour minority in the Select Committee and not those of the Conservative majority. This matter dominated the Scottish political scene in August. Even in Edinburgh during the festival people spoke of nothing but the report of the Select Committee on inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The five members of this Committee who are also members of the Select Committee have onerous and time-consuming responsibilities in respect of the Select Committee. It is a worthwhile job, and they should not be overburdened by the work of a Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy for us to say "The Conservatives are the majority. They can stuff the Committee with whomever they choose". But the political reality in Scotland is that there are not enough Conservatives to go round. The Conservatives may be good at winning elections in other parts of the United Kingdom, but they are not much good in Scotland—they could not even beat me. So we recognise that they have difficulty in manning committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not endeavouring to assist the Government, but we recognise that they are imposing burdens on Conservative Members. We also have a concern for the whole of Scotland, and feel that the Scottish people are entitled to representation of as good quality as anywhere else in the United Kingdom. If we are forced to sit in this Committee, the representation which the Scottish people will get will not be satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many problems in Scotland and in the United Kingdom as a whole which we would like to consider, and if we are here, meeting in the afternoon as well as in the morning, we shall not be able to devote the amount of time that we consider necessary to the affairs of the country as a whole. For many of us that is a source of considerable regret. We accept that we have to specialise and do a job of work wherever the Whips tell us to do it. We do not complain or cavil about that. But the burden should not become unduly onerous simply because of the Government's desire to railroad legislation through the House—legislation which is wanted by very few people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the part of the Bill that we have been considering, relating to the parents' charter, we have had representations from the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities. It has made it clear that it will be virtually impossible to implement the legislation in the coming academic year. So there is no pressing need for that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assisted places scheme deals with only a relatively small number of people. We think that the extension of privilege can wait another year. If the people have lived this long without it, they can wait that bit longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the Warnock part of the Bill on special educational needs, if for a moment—I think that my hon Friend the Member for West Stirling-shire will echo my feelings—we thought that the Government were prepared to spend a significant
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
amount of money to provide for the special educational needs of children, we should allow the Bill to go through in a flash. But we know that they are not prepared to do that. They have said that they are not prepared to provide any money to make this cherished dream a reality. They are prepared to pussyfoot around the Warnock report and make hollow noises, but they are not prepared to put their money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to undertake to provide the necessary £10 million or £20 million to make the dreams of Warnock a reality, we should seriously consider assisting the passage of this legislation. But as it is, we are not prepared to assist. We shall continue to give this legislation our detailed consideration. We shall not filibuster. I know that you have taken great care, Mr. Hunt, to equip yourself with a full understanding of our earlier proceedings, and I am sure that your reading of the Committee Hansards is illuminating in one respect, if not many others. That is in regard to the amount of time taken by the Minister to answer the case that the Opposition have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inordinate length of the Minister's replies tends to suggest that he is trying to set us up for further sittings—either that or he is filibustering. We have seen the look of despair in Government Members' eyes when the Minister has gone on and on trying to reply to debates. We were wondering why that was. Then on Thursday all was revealed. It was a very simple plot—it had to be simple, because we know that the Minister is not a complicated man—to try to convey the impression that the Opposition were spending an undue amount of time on our reasonable and serious amendments. The manner in which he sought to convey that impression was by taking, in many instances, as long to reply to a debate as the debate had taken in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to attribute to other members of the Committee any such motives, but we feel that the Minister is, because of last night's vote, running scared. He wants to see this legislation pushed through. He feels that he must get something on the statute book which he can call his own. I think that this is the first major piece of legislation that the Minister has sought to put on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other monument which may well be constructed to the Minister's memory in Scotland will he written in the unemployment statistics of the Department of Employment Gazette, which, I think comes out today. He shares with the Secretary of State the major responsibility for those appalling figures, because he is Under-Secretary with responsibility for industry as well. In his responsibility for industry he is doing even worse than—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member must relate his remarks to the sittings motion. I do not see the relevance of his speech at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was endeavouring to show was that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland would he spending more time on education than on industry. Therefore, he will not be able to deal with either of those responsibilities in a satisfactory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
I am merely giving evidence that his record in office has been disastrous, and that the calamitous situation that now confronts Scotland means that less time should be spent on the Bill, and more time on the industrial and economic problems. The only way in which that can be done is for the Committee to meet less frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggested on the previous sittings motion that the Committee should meet on only one morning a week. Unfortunately, that suggestion did not meet with the Committee's approval. Since then, unemployment in Linwood, and other areas, has gone out of control. The Minister clearly does not have his hands on the reins of power. We should like to see both his hands off the reins, and his backside out of the horse's saddle---to sustain the metaphor, although I do not wish to take it any further than that. If we had the opportunity to get him out of office we would take it gladly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we do not have the power to do that, and we must make the best of a pretty bad job. The best that we can do in the circumstances is to suggest that the Committee meets less frequently than intended by even the Minister. We recognise that that would not be in order, so I shall not pursue that course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that it is necessary to railroad this legislation through in the way that the Minister wants. We do not feel that it is appropriate that he should seek to overburden his already heavily-laden colleagues. It is evident that they have so much work to do that they choose to do their correspondence in the Committee Room, although I appreciate that they keep an ear open for what is going on. With the exception of the Minister, Government Members are so overworked that they cannot even find the time to write speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that some Conservative hon Members, on occasion, find the time to draft amendments, on which we sometimes have debates. Then the Minister turns round and hits them with his metre stick, or whatever he uses, and says "Sit down, and withdraw it". After they have their run they go back into their boxes, to be taken out and polished only at the time of a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not like the idea that the Government's supporters are being silenced, because we feel that in a healthy democracy there must be a discourse with all hon Members. This morning there are only five Government Members here, and if you, Mr. Hunt, and I were not here, I do not think that there would be a quorum. My colleagues would be happy to assist in delaying the proceedings if that were felt appropriate, because we feel that it is wrong for us to carry on when there are so few Government Members around. Even the Government Whip is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alleged supporters of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I have complete sympathy with my hon Friend, because we have not heard many voices raised in support of the Bill. On Second Reading the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay)
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
—who is not here now, although I have insulted him before in his presence, so he will not be unduly offended if I insult him in his absence—spoke at inordinate length. I think that he spoke for 30 minutes at a time When there was a self-denying ordinance on the part of most hon Members to afford opportunities to their colleagues to participate. In this Committee we find that the normally articulate, and indeed verbose, hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is almost denied a chance to speak, because of the amount of work the poor man has to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that it is unfair to treat anyone, even a Tory, in such a way. We must therefore press as hard as we can against this draconian measure under which we would have to meet four times a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not tried to discuss the length of the second sitting; I do not want to put ideas into the Minister's head. Long nights could lie ahead if he gets his way, although I think that such a course of action may well stretch the patience even of those hon Gentlemen who are loyal to the Government, those who have rediscovered their loyalty this morning and those Back Benchers who abstained last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are embarking on a dangerous course. I realise that their high-risk strategy is in accordance with the manner in which they are running the country. The longer it is adhered to, the higher the risk becomes. But we do not feel that Scottish education should be treated in this way. Scottish education is far too important a matter to have to bear yet another legislative burden. We would therefore be most unhappy if the motion were adopted, but we see that the tyrannical Whip is here again, and we know that he and his colleagues in the Whips' Office are determined to get this legislation—and any legislation—through.[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had always thought of the Minister as a desiccated book-keeper, but his comments from a sedentary positon about the tie of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire reveal an interest in the arts that I would not have considered to be his strong suit. If he is responsible for the arts in Scotland—and he is Minister for nearly everything else —one can understand why the Scottish cultural scene is in such a parlous state. Nevertheless, we are indebted to the Minister for what I am sure my hon Friend took as a compliment. We know that the Minister can, on occasions, be flippant and indeed almost insolent to distinguished Members of Parliament, and we are grateful to him for his expressions of approbation—sedentary though they were—of my hon Friend's tie. I am sure that my hon Friend will echo my sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to overtax my voice at this stage; I may have to use it again later today. I feel sure that the points that I have made will now be embellished by many of my colleagues who feel the same sense of revulsion and outrage at this draconian attempt to drive through legislation which none of the Labour members of the Committee want but which we feel should be treated—if it must become law—in a serious and considered manner. If we meet in double sittings twice a week, we will not have the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
opportunity for reflection that is at the heart of our legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I register our opposition to what we consider is a most unfortunate motion by a desperate Government. Perhaps it is their last throw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have got a bit tired of such motions over the years. It is inevitable that the Government should table such a motion, because they have no mandate whatever in Scotland for what they are doing. But I shall return to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even assuming that the Government had a mandate, there would be no need for the motion. In the Official Report of our proceedings to date there is little evidence of filibustering by the Oppositon, and no one could accuse Conservative Members of filibustering. But the Minister may be interested to know that the Committee has sat for 10 hours and I have not opened my mouth until now because I recognise that my hon Friends are quite capable of dealing with the Bill without my assistance. I am speaking now only to try to show that this motion is not only unnecessary but untimely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that the Bill is unpopular is an understatement. We have said many times before that no authoritative educational body in Scotland wants it. I defy the Minister to give us the name of one educational body in Scotland which welcomes the Bill in toto. It is almost as unpopular as the Budget. It has no friends. But the Government have seen fit to produce it and call it a charter to extend parents' freedom of choice. That advertisement is about as phoney as that for the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act, which is intended to flog off public assets, to save the taxpayer from footing the housing subsidy bill and at the same time put millstones around the necks of many council house tenants who would therefore—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member is going very wide of the sittings motion. I must ask him to confine his remarks to the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just comparing this Bill and the claims made on its behalf with those made on behalf of the tenants' rights Act. But I shall leave it at that and return to the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are seeking either to wear us down or to ensure that they get the Bill this Session. I suppose it is the latter. They want the Bill and they cannot get it. With the composition of the Committee as it is, if we walked out right now, there would be no quorum. Time and time again we keep the quorum for the Government. It is not with my co-operation. I advise my hon Friends to walk out now and see whether there is a quorum. I could call attention to the fact that there was no quorum and we could see what happened. Is there a quorum now, Mr. Hunt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a quorum at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not. The quorum is six with the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is five on the Floor of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot easily walk out. But I am just making the point that the Government cannot get controversial legislation through in Scottish Committees unless they have the Opposition's co-operation. On the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill and now on this Bill the Government rely on us for their quorum. That is indefensible. Now this motion presumes to compel the Opposition to come along on Tuesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons, Thursday mornings and Thursday afternoons when there is no urgency for this legislation. If it were not passed, not a single individual in Scotland would suffer or complain about the lack of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, even assuming that the Bill did reach the statute book, no other major Scottish legislation is waiting to come to the Committee. The only legislation now pending concerns matrimonial rights. It has already had its Second Reading in the Lords, so it is not yet ready to come to this place. So I repeat that there is no urgency about this legislation in terms of the welfare of the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the amendment, which I hasten to say was put on the Amendment Paper without consultation. It does not make sense, but the intention is clear. In case the Minister makes a point of its nonsense, I would prefer to propose a manuscript amendment to delete everything after "Thursdays" in line 2 and add
	<br><blockquote><p>"at half-past Ten o'clock and on Tuesdays at half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote>
The effect of that manuscript amendment would be to strike out the Thursday afternoon sitting. Accepting that the Government will get its way eventually, I suggest that we see how we go by deleting Thursday afternoon sittings and keeping the Government's original motion for Tuesday afternoon sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Moderator of the Assembly of the Church of Scotland is in London today. He is a very Christian gentleman. All Scottish members of the Committee have been invited to Dover House at 12.45 pm today to have a buffet lunch with the Moderator and to congratulate him on his magnificent speech in Perth yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon Gentleman read it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and Labour Members have an early-day motion on the Order Paper congratulating him on his courage and Christianity in declaring the evil nature of the unemployment created by the Prime Minister and the Government. We do not want to miss an opportunity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not see how the Moderator, excellent gentleman though he may be, is concerned with the sittings motion now before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, Mr. Hunt, the matter is relevant, because, as I pointed out, it would be extremely discourteous of any member of the Committee not to meet him on time. That means leaving here at 12.30 pm. The timing of the motion, therefore, is grossly discourteous to the Moderator, because it implies that the Government attach so much importance to the Bill that they must have a timetable motion, and yet at the same time they appear to suggest that we should adjourn today at 12.30 pm—in other words curtail the debate by half an hour and yet come back this afternoon and on Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon, and next Tuesday morning and next Tuesday afternoon. They are deliberately preventing us from having that half hour, or else forcing us to be grossly and consciously discourteous to one of the most Christian gentlemen in Scotland. That is the dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a way out. They could withdraw the motion and bring it forward again next Thursday. We could then continue our discussion until 12.30 pm today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and all my hon Friends want to meet the Moderator and tell him how glad we were that he made that speech in answer to the wretched speech made by the Prime Minister from the pulpit of a church in the City of London a few days previously. We cannot afford to miss that opportunity. Conservative Members cannot afford to miss it either. They should ask the Moderator's forgiveness for the attacks they made on him following his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely if any member of the Committee will want to be there, it is the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). He will want to dissociate himself from the strange rumours that appeared in the press after the Moderator made his statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) will not be encouraged by that intervention. He has gone wide enough already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not encouraged by anybody, Mr. Hunt. I make my own way in my own time, and I hope that I keep reasonably in order. I know that you are a very tolerant Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I should like to comment on the Government's continual practice of introducing sittings motions. It is almost inevitable that when controversial Scottish legislation is to be considered, there is a sittings motion after three or four sittings. That is followed almost equally inevitably by a guillotine motion. Every Tory Member then suddenly finds that he has a tongue in his head—if nothing else —and starts twittering on about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is intolerable. It places enormous pressures on hon Members. I was a member of the Committee on the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. The same thing happened then. As a result, I felt obliged to resign from the Select Committee on Procedure (Supply). I am extremely interested in the work of that Committee, which deals
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
with extremely important questions connected with the problem of how to restore parliamentary control of public expenditure. That is an example of the intolerable situations that hon Members are put in by motions such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government will get their way, but I suggest compromises: first, that the Government withdraw the motion today and bring it back, if need be, on Thursday, so that we can accommodate the Moderator, and, secondly, that in any case, whether they go ahead today or move a similar motion on Thursday, they should delete all reference to sittings on Thursday afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two reasonable propositions. I hope that the Government will consider them and give us a sympathetic reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be aware, Mr. Hunt, that I am a comparatively inexperienced Committee member. I explained to your co-Chairman, my hon Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay), that that was so, and asked him for his assistance and indulgence if I tended to stray from time to time or perhaps to make mistakes. I have observed that you have a very kind face, Mr. Hunt, and I have no reason to believe that that does not reflect your true character. Indeed, this is the only time that I have seen you in the Chair, and I wish to congratulate you on your fairness. Therefore, I know that I shall receive your kindness and your protection if some of the Conservative hon Members try to harass me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also say that I am not always so colourfully attired when attending a Committee, but I have just travelled to London direct from the Scottish Labour Party conference. As a result, my suitcase was filled only with red shirts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An education debate took place at the conference, and it may interest Committee members to learn that the conference totally rejected the Bill. If hon Members were aware of that, it might have some bearing on our future discussions. The very good debate was unanimous: indeed, it may have been televised, so all Committee members may have been able to obtain additional information about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a new Member, I am keen to learn about education, because I confess that it is a subject about which I did not have much knowledge. When we began to go through the Bill, I was somewhat surprised at its size. To be honest, as I have already explained, I do not always understand the terms and language that it uses. But I am happy to say that I am picking it up and that, from time to time, I understand the vagaries that it contains. However, I am surprised that it takes such a Bill to make the necessary amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still oppose the proposition that we should meet in the mornings and afternoons of both Tuesdays and Thursdays. I know that the Bill is complicated and I find that it takes me a long time to learn about it. I have had to consult the Warnock and Houghton reports but, frankly, I have not had time to do them justice. When examining reports of such size, I need guidance as to which parts appertain to the Bill. This morning we asked for the results and reports of the Special Standing Committee on the effects of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Warnock, especially in view of the implementation of the Warnock report as it concerns the Bill. I am glad that we shall be able to read those documents. We are also indebted to the Minister for supplying us with yet another document, although I do not know when I shall find the time to read it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that we should not refer to the effects of the Budget, other than in passing. I do not wish to single out anyone with regard to his vote on the Budget, but we should mention the Budget's effects which are relevant to the present matter. Because of its effects, I foresee many more difficulties at my constituency meetings, particularly with those who will suffer most, so that the time that I shall spend on those matters when I am in Scotland will leave me even less time for my parliamentary duties. Therefore, if we are to meet in the mornings and afternoons of Tuesdays and Thursdays, an intolerable burden will be placed on our time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been mentioned that some hon Members from all parties are members of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. We believe that to be the most important Select Committee, but its members simply cannot do their work justice if, at the same time, they are involved in this and perhaps other Bills. Therefore, I consider it to be unreasonable to expect hon Members on both sides to operate in any justifiable fashion on both matters. Even as a new Member, I think that that ought to be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are thin on the ground, and so an even more difficult and onerous task is placed on them. I feel the pressures without being a member of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. I might have been a member of that Committee but for the mischievous toss of a coin. I called "tails", but the coin showed "heads" and my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) sat on that Committee However, on reflection, I am glad that I lost the toss because I could not have done justice either to the Bill or to that Committee had I been on both. If I had been on the Select Committee, I would not have asked to be a member of this Committee because it would have been an onerous task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all hon Members have school visits, particularly during April, May and June. Last year an entire school visited. The visit was so successful that the children are coming again. They happen to be coming on a day on which the Committee may be sitting both morning and afternoon, if the motion is successful. Ninety-six children from the New Farm Loch primary school in Kilmarnock are coming, not of course to see their Member of Parliament, although that is part of the reason, but to see around the building and to learn about Parliament. I shall not be able to accompany them because I shall be stuck in Committee at a time when perhaps I could be doing more good with my young constituents. I would not intend to indoctrinate them, but at least I should let them know what happens in Parliament. However, I shall have to tell those kids that although I should like to be with them unfortunately I shall be working on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill, which the Minister is hell-bent on forcing through,
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
and I shall try to give them the reasons. That school visit would have taken up some of my time. I would have been glad to give it, but that time is now to be denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to sit on Tuesday mornings and Thursday evenings—I have not experienced it, but I understand that we can sit all night—I do not think that I shall be able, physically, to attend all those sittings. Although I may not be imparting any knowledge or adding a great deal to the Committee, I am concerned that I may miss some valuable additions to my education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to consider the suggestion made by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), that we should abandon this idea and bring the motion forward again next week, after we all have had the opportunity to visit the Moderator, could he not consider some form of flexitime? I know something about flexitime because I worked in industry before coming to the House. Flexitime was an innovation which was brought into industry and sometimes frowned upon both by management and by trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by my hon Friend's admirable suggestion, but instead of calling it flexitime, could we not call it—in deference to the Minister—"Fletchertime"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be an innovation. The expression would be understood, for good reasons. If we can afford some flexitime, it will enable us, perhaps, to meet on a Tuesday afternoon instead of a Tuesday morning, or a Thursday morning or a Thursday afternoon. Because of economic circumstances, I am forced to live at Forest Hill—far out from the centre of London—and cannot always guarantee to get here at 10.30 am because of the traffic problems and the odd occasions when one of British Rail's trains does not run. Everyone in London has difficulties in travelling to and from work, which is why flexitime is so valuable to those who work here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal should certainly be considered. It would not mean that we should all necessarily be here on Tuesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons, Thursday 'mornings and Thursday afternoons, and I am not suggesting that we should drift in and out of the Committee as we wished. It would have to be agreed in advance which Tuesday mornings and Tuesday afternoons are to be suggested. As four sittings are involved in any week, we could perm our Committee 'meetings to ensure that there were no two consecutive sittings. So a Tuesday afternoon could not follow a Tuesday morning sitting, nor could there be a Thursday morning after a Tuesday afternoon sitting, and a Thursday afternoon would not follow a Thursday morning sitting. Then in the Jack Boulder fashion we would have no consecutive sittings either on the same or on consecutive sittings days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea is not as complicated as it may sound. I may not have explained it sufficiently lucidly for hon Members to 'understand. It means that if we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
were to sit on Tuesday morning we would miss Tuesday afternoon. We would then be available to meet Thursday morning, but not on Thursday afternoon. If, on the first occasion, we had met on Tuesday afternoon, we would not meet on the Thursday morning, but we would meet on the Thursday afternoon. Even if we were not to do it in consecutive order, and if we did it in straight fashion, we could permutate the four times that we could meet. That would be four times three, which is 12, and then divided by two, which would give us six opportunities for doubling up on any of these two occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon Gentleman will not go through all the permutations. He is delaying the Committee, and, in spite of his personally flattering remarks to me at the beginning of his speech, I must now call him to order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hunt. I appreciate your guidance. I did not intend to go through all the permutations, but I wanted to make sure that the Minister understood the basis of my argument. A type of flexitime might have been acceptable, although I would prefer that the motion should be withdrawn and replaced if necessary although I am not necessarily in favour of its being replaced—on Thursday of next week. That would give us the opportunity to keep engagements this week that have already been booked. Even as a new Member, I find that my diary is packed, and I am sure that yours is, Mr. Hunt. We could do with less time in the Committee and more time to deal with the effects of the Budget and other pressing matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps some of my colleagues would like to express their reservations about the motion. I am opposed to it and hope that the Minister will consider withdrawing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has met only four times, and in my experience of Committees I have never known a Minister who is so incompetent in organising his timetable that he has to table a further sittings motion after only four sittings. I would have thought that from his point of view the Committee was making reasonable progress—if progress is the correct word to use for this Bill, because it is not a progressive Bill; it is one of the most regressive pieces of legislation that has been seen in Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that you Mr. Hunt, or indeed the Minister, or any of his supporters, can accuse either me or my hon Friends of undue delaying tactics or filibustering. We have put forward reasonable amendments in the most moderate fashion, with good, short speeches, and it is a pity that we have not had the constructive replies from the Minister that we are entitled to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears to me that the Government are being unduly impatient in tabling yet another sittings motion. As I said about our first sittings motion, I would have thought that the Government would just take their time. There is a Latin saying: "festina lente". I emphasise "lente" rather than "festina". I see that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
Minister does not know what I am talking about, because he did not have the advantage of the classical education that 1 received, in a comprehensive school in Cowdenbeath. I urge the Minister to reconsider the motion, in his own interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend translate, for the benefit of the Minister, that what he has said means "Hurry slowly"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Festina" means "hasten". I think that it is a first conjugation verb—"festinare"—and "festina" is the imperative. "Lente" just means "slowly". It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but that is why the emphasis in this case should be on "lente" rather than "festina". If it is translated loosely, it really means "Take your time"—make reasonable progress, and do not make a headlong rush into a collision, which the Minister seems to be heading for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still many bodies—I do not know whether Conservative Members have received the correspondence that we have received from a wide range of bodies throughout Scotland which are very interested in Scottish education, and in defending it against the Bill—which put forward reasonable points of view and suggestions for amendments. If we try to rush things that would be against the interests of not just good government and good opposition, but the thousands in Scotland who see the Bill as a threat to the educational rights of the vast majority of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has already referred to the difficulty that the Government face in manning the Committee. At present, we are sitting only twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday morning. If the amendment is passed, the Committee will sit on Tuesday morning, Tuesday afternoon, possibly again after a break for dinner on Tuesday evening, and also on Thursday morning. How will the Government man the Committee? Again, it will be up to the Opposition to provide a quorum, although the Committee just managed to retain a quorum this morning, when my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) invited us to leave the room to prove a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth mentioning that on the Committee's first sitting the Government lost the quorum not just once, but twice. It is in black and white in the Official Report, in the middle of the speech of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) where it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 3 March 1981; c. 11.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The same thing is recorded again, 10 minutes later. It is down there in black and white. Imagine the feelings of those with the interests of Scottish education at heart when they read that in Hansard. The Government ought to be thoroughly ashamed that they cannot maintain the quorum in their Committee. If they find it difficult to keep the quorum with two sittings a week, it will be even more difficult for them to do so with three or perhaps four sittings a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the sittings motion about finishing by a certain time on Tuesdays. It therefore seems that at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
some future date the Government could decide that we should meet on Thursday evenings as well. The sitting beginning at half-past four is open-ended. It could continue until 7.30 pm, 9 pm, 10 pm or midnight, or through the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like to refer to others who could be grossly inconvenienced by the sittings motion—the other Ministers whose names appear on the Bill. They have other ministerial duties. Two Ministers are already members of the Committee, but there are other Ministers who would be entitled to come in at some stage and make contributions to compensate for the incompetence of the Ministers who are full voting members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is stated on the back page of the Bill that it was presented by:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Secretary Younger, supported by Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn, Mr. Alexander Fletcher, Mr. Russell Fairgrieve and Mr. Nigel Lawson".</p></blockquote>
Of those, only the two Under-Secretaries of State for Scotland are full voting members of the Committee. But I think that, on a Bill of this importance, the Secretary of State for Scotland should come to the Committee at some stage to give us an explanation. According to Standing Order 63(2),
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a standing committee which is to consider a bill brought in upon a ways and means resolution any Minister of the Crown, being a Member of this House, though not a member of the standing committee, may take part in the deliberations of the committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or move any amendment or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote>
According to the Standing Orders, it is permissible for the Secretary of State for Scotland himself to come along at some stage, and I think that that would be advisable. Neither he nor the Minister responsible for education knows very much about education, but he is the only Cabinet Minister who has responsibility for the Bill and for education matters in Scotland too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent upon the Secretary of State himself to attend, but he has a wide range of responsibilities. As an hon Member who represents an English constituency, Mr. Hunt, you may not realise the breadth of the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Scotland. They cover not only education but industry, employment, housing, health, transport, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and a whole range of different matters. He is kept very busy indeed. It would be too much to expect the Secretary of State to attend the Committee during an all-night sitting. This sittings motion, which would allow all-night sittings, would be against the interests of the Secretary of State himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember that during the Committee stage of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill last year even the Prime Minister came in and caused all kinds of fluttering in the dovecots. Conservative Members were virtually fighting each other to catch the Chairman's eye in order to appeal to the right hon Lady for favours. The country is now in a far worse state than it was 12 months ago, so if we are to meet in the evening, the right hon Lady might feel the need to come along. Some of us would be very concerned if she did, because she has more important things to do than listen to us or to Conservative Members who are trying to curry favour with her. Therefore, my hon Friend made a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my lion Friend for reminding me of that. I do not see the Prime Minister's name on the Bill, but she is head of this useless Government and has ultimate responsibility for the legislation that they are trying to put on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I disapprove of practically everything that the Prime Minister does, I admit that she has many commitments and is very busy. It may not be convenient for her to come along on, say, Tuesday afternoons. The Prime Minister has Question Time on Tuesday afternoons and should be tired after answering 15 minutes of questions, especially after the strong pressure put upon her by my right hon and hon Friends on the Opposition Front Bench and the Back Benches. It would be a bit much to expect her, after dealing with those difficult questions, to take part in our—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman should move on to the next stage of his speech. The Prime Minister is not a member of this Committee, and his remarks are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Standing Order No. 63(2), Mr. Hunt, the Prime Minister is entitled to come to a Committee, and under Standing Order No. 63(1) the Solicitor-General for Scotland is also entitled to come along. He may not know a great deal about Scottish education either, but he has constituents who are very concerned about this Bill. I know, because he represents the neighbouring constituency to mine. Part of both our constituencies come under the Central region education authority. I know that the Central regional council is very concerned about certain aspects of the Bill and has made representations to me and probably also to the Solicitor-General for Scotland. Therefore, he may feel compelled to come and give us the advantage of his legal expertise, because the Bill contains legal complexities. I think that it would be very unfair, perhaps impossible, to expect the Solicitor-General for Scotland to get out of his bed and take part in our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon Friend concede that one of the difficulties of the Solicitor-General for Scotland has been getting out of bed in the morning, rather than in the evening? We could weaken our argument by advancing this any further. He might prefer evening to morning sittings on the grounds that he would have longer in his pit, so that may be a dangerous course to embark upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. I understand that the Solicitor-General for Scotland has difficulties early in the morning and late at night. It may be almost impossible to find a convenient time for him to come along. I do not see how this sittings motion will facilitate his presence. 1 am sure that all members of the Committee would welcome his presence and would wish to hear what he has to say about the Bill's legal aspects, as well as its educational aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to an important point which I do not think has been mentioned. The Bill is about the educational rights of children. I do not think that it would be unduly selfish of Committee members to think also of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
the rights of their own children. The Bill is concerned with the educational rights of all the children of Scotland. But often one of the difficulties of hon Members representing Scottish constituencies is that they see little of their families, because the holidays in local education authority schools do not always coincide with parliamentary recesses. That seems likely to happen, at least partially again. Although we have not yet been given the definite dates for the Easter Recess, I know that the Easter holidays of my four children in Central region will be from Tuesday 7 April to Tuesday 21 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there are many hon Members on both sides of the Committee who want to see at least something of their families during the Easter Recess. But, if the Committee is to sit on Tuesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons, Tuesday evenings and possibly throughout Tuesday nights as well as on Thursday mornings, Thursday afternoons and Thursday evenings —again, possibly throughout the nights—we shall see hardly anything of our families. That is a very poor show on the Government's part. I know that the children of some Tory Members go to fee-paying schools, and their holidays may coincide with parliamentary recesses—perhaps the Bill will continue until the Summer Recess; that remains to be seen—but those of other hon Members attend local education authority schools. I hope that they will support me on this matter—namely, that if this sittings motion is passed, it will be virtually impossible for hon Members on both sides to devote some time to their own children. Furthermore, they will be expected to debate a Bill which would destroy the educational opportunities of thousands of other children. Therefore, if we are to put children first—whether our own, or others in Scotland—we should reject the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon Friends referred to the fact that Committee sittings on Tuesday afternoons and Thursday afternoons may clash with other commitments. I shall give an example. The sittings motion proposes that the Committee shall sit at 4.30 pm on 24 March. That is next Tuesday. But I remind hon Members that on that date another appalling level of unemployment will be announced on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State for Employment—or rather the Secretary of State for Unemployment, as he should be called. It is almost certain that there will be demands, either by the official Opposition or by individual Members—including Committee members—for an emergency debate. If that takes place, it is clear that hon Members here will want to take part in it. Presumably the hon Member for Edinburgh, North, who is the Minister responsible for unemployment in Scotland, will at least want to listen to the debate and possibly to take part in it. Therefore, I believe that the sittings motion is precipitate. If we start to meet every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, that will interfere with a lot of other important parliamentary commitments on the Floor of the House and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remind hon Members that next Tuesday there may well be a few ministerial statements at the end of Prime Minister's Question Time, so that my Ten-Minute Bill may not be reached until half-past four. I am sure that all Committee members will want to listen to that debate and to vote for the Bill, because its
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
purpose is to rid the House of Commons of those who stood on a party description on the ballot paper at the general election, and who have now thrown that ticket away. A Tory defector is now joining the Council for Social Democracy as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member must not promote his Bill at this stage. Will he kindly return to the motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Bill will come up on Tuesday afternoon next week. It may not come up until 4.30 pm, in which case, if the sittings motion is accepted, it will be difficult, indeed impossible, for members of the Committee to listen and possibly take part in the important debate and to vote. I understand that some of the Social phoney Democrat rascals may oppose my Bill, despite the fact that it stands for the rights of parliamentary democracy. I therefore ask hon Members who are concerned about the rights of Parliament and the retention of parliamentary democracy to vote against the sittings motion, so that they can vote on my important Bill next Tuesday afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the motion is passed, I take it that we shall sit this afternoon at 4.30 pm. That is a disgrace, an absolute insult. We should not even be sitting this morning. We should have at least a half-day to celebrate the visit to London of the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. When important people visit schools, children get a half-day and sometimes a full day's school holiday after the visit. With the visit of such an important person, it would have been appropriate for today's sittings to be cancelled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon Friend's point. The Government have arranged to have the Royal wedding—for which I have no great approval—on a date when all children and most people in Scotland will be on holiday anyway. To arrange the date for a day which is already a public holiday is typical of the mean-minded way in which the Government operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Royal wedding to which my hon Friend is referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that question will not be answered, nor asked again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be appropriate if the Committee did not sit this afternoon. I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to table an amendment to mark the visit of the Moderator to the Scottish Office in London today, I believe that he is coming afterwards to the House of Commons, either this afternoon or tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the Minister's reluctance to mark the visit of the Moderator, because the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State are rattled by the blistering attack which the Moderator made on them in his good sermon in Perth the other week, condemning the blasphemous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister must feel guilty and will want to get his own back on the Moderator, but I do not see why he should use the Committee to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
As a mark of respect we should abandon the Committee now and not bother to come back this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is making a good point about the Moderator, but, as a good Catholic, he should remember that it is St. Patrick's Day. As my hon Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) is also a good Catholic, it is appropriate that we should use our ecumenical instincts and tell the Moderator, irrespective of our religious differences, that we are united in condemning the immorality of the present Government. It is important that we should not lose the opportunity to express those views to the Moderator, irrespective of our different commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right. That is another reason why the Committee should not be sitting today. It is the feast of St. Patrick. My grandfather, who was born in Ireland, would turn in his grave if he knew that I was working on St. Patrick's Day, but he would be pleased to hear that I was sticking up for children's educational rights. St. Patrick's Day used to be, and may still be, a holiday of obligation in Ireland. The portrait of St. Patrick is still hung in the Central Lobby. It would be appropriate if we had a holiday to celebrate the Feast of St. Patrick and also the visit by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is right to say that that would be an ecumenical gesture by the Committee and the Government. However, the Government do not seem to be particularly interested. They have decided to mark the Moderator's visit simply by a lunch given by the Secretary of State at Dover House. Several hon Members have been invited to the lunch. I do not know whether you have been invited, Mr. Hunt, but I am sure that you would be made most welcome. You can come with me and 1 shall make sure that you get in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I deplore the Secretary of State's politics, I know that he is a hospitable man and I fear that his generosity at the lunch will be so overwhelming that some Tory Members may have difficulty in getting back here by 4.30 pm. Therefore, it would be most appropriate for the Minister to accept an amendment to the motion that we do not sit this afternoon—the Feast of St. Patrick and the day when the Moderator is paying his respects to us as parliamentarians. Surely we ought to reciprocate that respect and not sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. Despite what Committee members may feel, I do not intend to delay the Committee in any way. We are discussing an important principle. It is with unnecessary haste that the incompetent Minister—as he was described by my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—is bulldozing the sittings motion through Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Committee members have drawn attention to the fact that we have had barely 10 hours in which to discuss the Bill, and already the Minister is bulldozing through another sittings motion. I wonder what is behind the necessity for the Committee to meet from 10.30 am until 1 pm and from 4.30 pm until whenever the Committee agrees to adjourn. I suspect—and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
referred to this on the previous sittings motion—that there is something more devious behind it. As soon as we start to discuss the reasons why the Minister is in such haste, rumours begin to circulate around Scotland. On this Bill, rumour and innuendo are rife in Scotland about the fact that the Minister does not wish to allow hon Members—certainly Opposition Members—to consult the bodies that they would wish to consult if they are to make contributions to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important Bill for which, as many of us have indicated, there is no necessity. Its main provisions cannot be implemented until 1982, so there is clearly no need for haste. We must, on behalf of our constituents and the children of Scotland, look elsewhere for the reasons why the Bill is being taken at such a pace. As I have said, there are many rumours about the reason why the Minister has decided, after only 10 hours of debate, to bring forward a second sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, Opposition Members met a representative of one of those bodies which they wish to consult. We have already discovered that that body has been misled by the Minister. We discussed certain amendments which it was convinced by the Minister should be made to the Bill and the representative is now returning to that body to discuss whether those amendments should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meeting was able to take place because Opposition Members gave up the time that they require to carry out their responsibilities as Members of Parliament. I have not seen my mail this morning, so I do not know whether there are any major problems in Dundee with which I should have involved myself before coming to the Committee. I know that I should be handling a serious immigration case which could result in one of my constituents being deported next week. Unfortunately, I could not deal with it because of those serious and necessary discussions with a representative of a body from Scotland who has discovered that his discussions with the Minister were not as honest as the Minister intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the other matters that comes to mind is that, while the Opposition are trying to contribute to the Bill, Conservative Members are doing their mail. The hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) spent most of last Tuesday's sitting reading Soviet Weekly. I do not disagree with that, because it has an educational supplement, and if the hon Member was reading it to further his knowledge and make a contribution to the Bill, I am sure that neither you, Mr. Hunt, nor any other Chairman would disapprove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The record must be put straight. It took me about 10 seconds to skim through Soviet Weekly to see whether there was anything relevant to the debate last week, and there was not. I have, however, taken the opportunity today to look at the Moderator's sermon, to which much reference has been made. If Opposition Members had read it they would realise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it in order for an intervention to take the form of a speech? The hon Member has had all morning to make speeches about the Moderator's sermon, and he is choosing a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
most inopportune moment to intrude in my hon Friend's very good speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Member will conclude his intervention briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Hunt. The point that I am trying to make is that the reference to Soviet Weekly, which happened to be on my desk last week, is as irrelevant and inaccurate as the references this morning to the Moderator's sermon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly rely on your good judgment, Mr. Hunt, as the final arbiter of what it is relevant for Members to refer to during the Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is in order for hon Members to read what they like. What they must not do is to do the crossword in Soviet Weekly. That would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never had occasion to try the crossword in Soviet Weekly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the relevant points made by Opposition Members. My hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey) made the point that he is a new Member. I had a similar experience as a new Member on an aerospace Bill. When going through the highways and byways of a Bill one needs a Chairman who understands that an hon Member wishes to make a useful contribution but has to rely on the experience of the Chair to help him through. I would not wish to suggest that I had no experience of Committees, and certainly my hon Friend has such experience. He made one or two points on which I would like to place on record my disagreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the previous sittings motion, I admit that I suggested that I would have supported the Bill had there been something in it of relevance to Scotland and the children of Scotland—some of whom have joined us this morning. I am sure that all members of the Committee will welcome the children who have come from Scotland to listen to a debate on an important Bill. We hope that they will get a good education. Opposition Members are determined to ensure that the Bill will not harm the children who are watching our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend spoke about flexitime. I said that I would be prepared to work overtime on the Bill. I would be prepared to work Saturdays and Sundays, despite the fact that my union is opposed to such overtime. My union is opposed to flexitime. There are a number of anomalies to which I would like to refer, but if I were to do so I am sure that you would quickly intervene, Mr. Hunt. Not all those who work flexitime are at work at any one time. It does not lead to a good debate and good running of a Bill if hon Members are continually leaving and rejoining a Committee, because clearly they cannot listen to the important points made, and therefore cannot make a real contribution. I seriously caution the Committee about considering flexitime on such an important Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to say much more, because I do not wish it to be said that I have been filibustering or seek-
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
ing to waste the time of the Committee. Opposition Members have made it clear that this legislation is regressive rather than progressive. Therefore, it is incumbent on those Committee members who are concerned about Scottish education to ensure that the Bill is processed quickly, reasonably and, more importantly, competently. We cannot bring to these discussions the necessary competency unless we proceed in a way that allows us to consult all those bodies which we wish to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been far too precipitate in bringing forward the second sittings motion after only 10 hours in Committee. It reflects his failure to maintain a quorum, the interest of his hon Friends or that of the Opposition. He has also failed to show the concern that is vital if the young people who are listening to the debate this morning are to obtain the type of education of which Scotland has been proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will join my hon Friends in opposing the motion. The amendment is much more relevant, as is the suggestion made by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deliberately not referred to the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, whom we shall be joining for lunch shortly. I do not wish to strain your patience, Mr. Hunt, because he has been referred to by nearly every Committee member. But I wish to join with those hon Members when I say that I am grateful and pleased to be able to speak to this humanitarian man who is concerned about the education of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Member for Galloway will pay attention for a moment and read the Moderator's speech, he will see that a whole section refers to the young in Scotland. The Moderator particularly says that he could not support groups, organisations or Governments that are not concerned about young people. I would not go so far as to say that he suggests that they would be evil, but he certainly says that they would need to be considered very carefully. I believe that it would have been more relevant if, with all humility, the Committee members—especially the Minister—instead of discussing the sittings motion, had listened again to the Moderator's sermon. Those of us who do not share his religious beliefs but who call ourselves Christians would, I am sure, be enlightened and heartened by his comments. It would have done Conservative Members a sight more good than sitting here writing letters and making no contribution towards the education of young people in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should draw the Committee's attention to the fact that, although the hon Gentleman and others have referred to the amendment, it has not been moved. I cannot put it at a later stage unless it is moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had used the necessary words, Mr. Hunt. But if I did not, I shall do so now in a manuscript amendment, to provide that the Committee could sit on Tuesday morning and Tuesday afternoon, and on Thursday morning, but not on Thursday afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that amendment (a) on the Amendment Paper achieves that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Hunt, it does not. If the amendment were accepted, the motion would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the further proceedings on the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock on Tuesdays."</p></blockquote>
It does not make sense. That was why 1 suggested that we delete everything that follows "Tuesdays" in the second line and instead insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and Tuesdays at half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote>
In effect, that would delete the Thursday afternoon sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rule that the amendment on the Amendment Paper is in order and is clear. On that basis, it is the one that will be put in due course. But the point of my intervention was to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that it had not bean moved, and to avoid later points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you think that it is in order, Mr. Hunt, I beg to move amendment (a), in line 2, after "half-past Ten o'clock and", insert "on Tuesdays".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the children who were in the Public Gallery have now left us, because they must surely have wondered what we were discussing. On the door of the Committee Room is a reference to the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill, but our debate this morning has had a low educational content. I say that without any imputation against hon Members taking part in it. We have been discussing the sittings motion and whether it is appropriate. The only thing that I have learned is that the hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) is a surreptitious reader of Soviet Weekly. I had always suspected that there were "sleepers" on Government Benches during speeches made by Opposition Members, but I had not noticed that it had gone that far. It is a fascinating piece of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no abjection in principle to the Committee's meeting on Tuesday afternoons. There are advantages in making use of our time as Members of Parliament on Committees and getting our teeth into a Bill. It is wrong to suggest—and I do not think that Opposition Members intended to suggest it—that such speedy progress will be made on the Bill that there will be insufficient time for external agencies to consult Members of Parliament. However, I think that all Scottish Members would have reservations if the Committee were to sit overnight, particularly on Thursdays, when most of us wish and intend to go to our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister should assure us that, should the motion be passed, there will be no question at any time of Thursday afternoon sittings continuing to the crack of dawn on Fridays. Whereas Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays constitute parliamentary core time, with Mondays being available for consultation, Fridays—except on the rare occasions
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
when hon Members wish to attend debates on Private Members' Bills—are a great opportunity to consult our own constituents. If Fridays were not available for that purpose, we should all be in some difficulty. Before I make up my mind finally how to vote on the motion, I shall want an assurance from the Minister that under no circumstances will the Committee sit past, say, 10 pm on a Thursday. That will allow all members of the Committee access to the sleepers, so that they can get home to their constituencies to do work that is a very important part of their job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enough in the Bill to keep us going a long time, and it would be advantageous if we were to spend more time on it. I suspect that in any event if we do not make progress there is a danger of a guillotine. However much hon Members may protest, they may be rather glad to see it, because it could prevent certain important parts of the Bill being left undiscussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided certain assurances are given about Thursday nights, I shall be tempted to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must oppose the motion at this stage, certainly in regard to the proposed Thursday evening sitting. I suggest that at this point, even the Tuesday evening sitting is not proven to be necessary. The progress that we have made on the Bill may not he to the Minister's satisfaction, but I do not think that any of the speeches made by the Opposition have been unnecessarily long or wordy. If you were to go through the Official Report of the first four sittings, Mr. Hunt, you would find that neither you nor Mr. Gourlay had to intervene to call members of the Committee to order. The speeches were relevant to the important educational matters at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still a new boy, but I have now sat on three Committees, and this is the earliest stage that a sittings motion of this kind has come before one of them. Much of the Committee's time has been taken up by the Minister giving long and often unnecessarily convoluted explanations of his amendments or his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ill-informed explanations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister has also used a lot of time in replies to debates, and some of his speeches have indulged in what I call "nickies". In other words he goes out of his way—as does the Solicitor-General for Scotland—to provoke the Opposition by his references to us or the points that we have made. The Solicitor-General did that with considerable repetitiveness during consideration of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and thus prolonged that Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister's response to our amendments has been so difficult for us to follow that we have had to ask for further explanations. Many of the problems have been created by the Minister because he seems incapable of giving dear answers to our questions or clear responses to our amendments. As a result, we have had to seek further explanations and have received even more con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
voluted or ill-informed answers, so that we have had to ask again what the explanation meant. It seems to me that if the Minister's responses have been of that nature on morning sittings only—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it in order for hon Members to read newspapers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether the newspaper in question had direct relevance to our debate. If not, reading it is certainly out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely acting on information which you gave earlier, Mr. Hunt, that, provided we did not do the crosswords, it was legitimate to read newspapers. I was reading a Scottish newspaper and endeavouring to keep myself as well informed as possible. I was looking for any information relevant to the Bill. I am not concerned about being discourteous to the Government Members on one of the rare occasions on which they all trouble to be here, but if it is discourteous to you, Mr. Hunt, I shall readily stop.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some doubt as to whether there is any reference in the Glasgow Herald to the present sittings motion, and, on those grounds, I ask the hon Member to desist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hunt, for your guidance. I am sure that there is much in that paper which is relevant to the Bill, if not directly relevant to the motion. I am sure that that illustrates Scotland's great problems, about which Members of Parliament ought to be concerned. That is relevant to the sittings motion, as it highlights one of the reasons why we do not wish to have afternoon sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We feel that we ought to have more time to deal with the problems of Scotland. The sittings motion would deprive us of time we could devote to those problems

The point that I was making before the point of order was that the Minister's replies had not been very satisfactory. If we sit in the evenings, it will be even more difficult for the Minister to convey the content of the briefs that he is given. I do not blame the advisers; it may be the Minister who is at fault. He does not appear to he able to understand the briefs very clearly. If he has even less time in which to study them, there will be considerable difficulties for the Committee.

I am aware that certain members of the Committee wish to go and see. the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. I do not intend to comment on that. I am not going myself, but I would not wish to delay other hon Members unnecessarily. Nor would I wish to comment on anything that has been said; I have already got myself into enough trouble in the past week.

The other Minister who is a member of the Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
mittee and has to sit here day in and day out is concerned with the Health Service in Scotland. That Health Service faces considerable difficulties. If the Minister is to be tied down in the Committee, what will happen to the Health Service in Scotland?

I hope that the motion will now be withdrawn. If it were moved again after we had sat in the mornings for two or three weeks, we might be able to reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday when the clock ran against us we were discussing the discontinuity of education and how it could he a problem for young people. Their education might be interrupted by the exercise of parental choice. 1 was endeavouring to point out that different types of schools and institutions often provided different course structures and in many instances, even the course content. There is a possibility that if children leave one school and
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
attend another their education could be interrupted and there would be an element of discontinuity. We are worried about that, and so we wish to bring home to the Committee the fact that we do not consider it necessary that the word "seriously" should he included in subsection (3)(b)(iii).

I shall discuss the group of amendments once I get my papers together again. There was a certain procedural hiccup on the part of some of my colleagues, caused by their enthusiasm to vote for and against the amendment and the motion. However, I am sure that I can wait for my lunch, like other Committee members. I can stave off the anxiety at not being able once more to renew my acquaintance with the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, at whose feet I sat for about 12 months as a student of moral philosophy. I do not know whether that did me much good. I am not sure whether it did him much good either, but he was paid considerably more than I was for the privilege of being at the Heriot-Watt university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
