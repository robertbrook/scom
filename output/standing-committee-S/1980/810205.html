<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The <i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday afternoon's sitting on Tuesday was not available in the Vote Office last night. As you know, we had the same difficulty during the sittings on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill. It is no reflection on <i>Hansard,</i> but it seems to me that the new Leader of the House needs to be given an opportunity for exercising his undoubted talents to improve the services.<br><br>
I do not say that the <i>Official Report</i> is compulsive bedtime reading. Nevertheless, on this occasion I was particularly anxious to read the altercation between the Minister and my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) about the circumstances in which an appeal to the sheriff would be appropriate. I never like to be shown in <i>Hansard</i> as having misquoted a Minister or an hon Member. Wherever possible I like to use the words from <i>Hansard</i> itself. I was prevented from finding out what they were, because <i>Hansard</i> was not available in the Vote Office last night.<br><br>
I know that you are sympathetic, Mr. Gourlay. You have raised these matters on our behalf before. Since we are moving into a period of afternoon sittings, it is essential that we have the <i>Official Report</i> by the evening before we commence our next sitting, at the very latest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair very much appreciates the hon Gentleman's point. I think that it is generally well known that the majority of hon Members acceped the rather cumbersome document that I have in front of me, the new format of <i>Hansard,</i> on the basis that it would be easier and quicker to produce. Therefore, there is disappointment. I undertake to write to the Leader of the House to see whether anything can be done to make <i>Hansard</i> more quickly available.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 41, in page line 6, leave out <i>"(a)"</i> and insert "(i)".—<i>[Mr. Rifkind.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
page 7, line 7, leave out "or any preceding".<br><br>
I recognise that this debate could well become a clause stand part debate, and I want to avoid that. The provision for comparability with a preceding year has serious implications. Local government is local democracy in action. In the event of a change of political power, of the electorate wishing to have a different administration in local government, there may well be a complete change of emphasis. Therefore, it is not really fair to compare one year's priorities with another's, when a different political emphasis is behind them.<br><br>
One could give examples of some local authorities in Central Scotland, where nationalist authorities in Clackmannan and Falkirk districts were replaced by Labour authorities. The nationalists tended to be Centre-Right in political persuasion and in their priorities, and Labour local authorities committed to different programmes, which were substantially supported by the electorate, would be coming in with a different mandate. For the Secretary of State to take the preceding years into account, without taking into account the change in the political circumstances, would be an abuse of democracy.<br><br>
Therefore, we think that this provision is unduly rigid. It does not take account of the political realities. On occasions there can also be changes in population. This was referred to in a previous sitting by my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), when he was speaking about social work budgets. As fewer old people are dying from one year to another, there are more of them needing care, treatment and support. Therefore, to take one year against another in that instance is not always a fair comparison.<br><br>
We ask that this phrase "or any preceding" be deleted, not on the grounds that we think that one cannot make comparisons, but rather that there are reasons, especially electoral change of fortune, why such comparisons are not necessarily fair. They are in many respects an abuse of the rights of the electors who have chosen authorities or administrations with different political priorities and different emphases, as well as the policies which they would like the authorities to pursue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have no doubt the Minister will point out, the amendment is probably defective in that if it were accepted it would make the duties of the Secretary of State less onerous. The Opposition's whole approach is to tighten up the provision so that it is more difficult for the Secretary of State to take action in this legalistic way against any offending authority. The whole trend of the Government here is to make sure that they have the new power to take action against Lothian region. That is the only one on the cards at the moment, as far as I am aware, but perhaps not. The Minister has not been very forthcoming.<br><br>
We are dealing with something which is not mandatory on the Secretary of State. He "may … have regard", so we are dealing with something which is optional. If it is optional, we have to ask ourselves, on the 'basis of comparison, how any preceding year comes into it.<br><br>
I presume that the alleged offence, if it can be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0702">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
described as such, committed by an authority is that it is budgeting for too high an expenditure. As soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent the Secretary of State will tell Lothian or any other authority, if the Minister likes to speculate on who might be the victim of this procedure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nithsdale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A mythical authority would do—"Rifkinland", for example, though that is not very original.<br><br>
What is the purpose of these words? Is it to make it more difficult for the Secretary of State to take the action, if he feels obliged, because of the word "may", to give 'the various criteria under paragraphs <i>(a), (b)</i> and (c)? What is the relevance of a "preceding year" for the basis of comparison? In other words why does he need to go to a preceding year in order to prove his case, if it is the current year's estimated expenditure that is the offending part of a local authority's machinery? Ministers will have benefited from our proceedings because of our having thought up some of .the awkward questions that a well-geared authority will come up with, given that authorities will not accept this interference by the Secretary of State in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and his hon Friend the Member far Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) have raised a perfectly fair point in asking for an explanation of the thinking behind the inclusion of the phrase "any preceding year" in the clause. I emphasise the point which the hon Member for Provan recognised, that this is a discretionary part of the considerations that the Secretary of State may take into account. Essentially, I think that what would be of relevance is the question of any proposed growth in the expenditure that the authority was considering, compared with the previous year.<br><br>
Let me emphasise that growth by itself does not necessarily mean that it is excessive and unreasonable—far from it. There may be circumstances in which growth would be absolutely justified and would be, of no particular significance. But it would, in our view—I am sure that the Committee would not disagree—be a relevant consideration to take into account if an authority were proposing significant or substantial growth in its expenditure for one year compared with the previous year, and it would be a factor which ought to be put in the balance when coming to an ultimate judgment on the question of its overall proposed expenditure.<br><br>
I fully accept the point made by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, that the reason why there may be apparent growth one year compared with the previous year may be that there has been a change of political complexion, and that the priorities of the council have radically changed because the majority in the council now hold a different political view. That is a perfectly valid point, which the Secretary of State will clearly be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
aware of. If he were not, it would soon be drawn to his attention by the authority concerned.<br><br>
Therefore, I wish to emphasise that growth by itself, as an abstract concept, is not clear evidence of excessive and unreasonable expenditure. It is, however, one factor amongst all the others that have been mentioned which in certain circumstances it would be relevant for the Secretary of State to take into account. Therefore, it is appropriate that he should have the discretion to do so, always with the proviso that the local authority may have perfectly good reasons why its apparent growth should be considered reasonable in the existing circumstances.<br><br>
I hope that with that explanation hon Gentlemen will feel able to agree that this phrase is perhaps, as the hon Member for Provan indicated, of equal benefit to the local authorities and the Secretary of State. It provides an extra factor which will have to be put into the balance before decisions are taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in good form this morning. He has said absolutely nothing of any great significance in that reply, other than to say that growth of itself is not bad and that it is an abstract concept. It is so abstract for me that it ceases to have any relevance. He has not explained the point, and I do not think that the Government have thought the matter out.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman said that the phrase could be of equal benefit to the authority and to the Secretary of State. That is not the purpose of the exercise. Its purpose is the benefit of the Secretary of State. The Minister has given no indication of the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may use these powers.<br><br>
I do not believe in these abstract concepts. I like to think that there is a purpose behind this. Surely there must have been meetings between officials of the Scottish Office and local authorities which have, to some extent, spelled out in what circumstances these powers will be used. The Minister has given us no clue to making sense of the "any preceding year" provision.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may ask a question or put an interrogatory comment to the Under-Secretary. I take his point that in comparing the expenditure of another local authority with that of the local authority in the firing line, it is reasonable to think that it might be useful to compare it with a previous year's expenditure by the second local authority, to see whether the curve of growth of the one under threat of sanction has been totally out of line.<br><br>
What I want to exclude—and I am not sure whether the wording does exclude it—is the possibility of the Secretary of State's looking at the comparable local authority and comparing its expenditure of, say, three years ago with a different year's expenditure of the authority under examination. We should not be getting unfair comparisons and building up what is really a record of previous convictions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
in order to bolster the charge against expenditure in the current year of the particular authority.<br><br>
The fact that for a number of years an authority is out of line is not necessarily relevant to whether it has been out of line in the year in question. The fact that it has almost been a sinner and that the machinery in clause 13 has been considered but not used in past years should be relevant in deciding whether it should be used in this year. There should be at least an attempt at an objective criterion. I am worried about preceding years being used as a telltale indicator as to whether it is relevant to go ahead now. It is a somewhat difficult point to get across, but I hope that the Minister follows it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman described his intervention as an interrogatory comment. I wondered for a moment what was the difference between an interrogatory comment and a rhetorical question. I think it is that the rhetorical question does not demand an answer and the interrogatory comment does. As the hon Gentleman described his intervention as the latter, I shall seek to provide an answer. I hope that it may also answer the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), to whom I apologise if I was not sufficiently informative in my earlier remarks.<br><br>
The hon Member for Provan asked in what circumstances growth itself might not be considered unreasonable. We are now, as we were for part of the term of office of the last Government, in a period in which local authorities are being asked to reduce their expenditure and in which there is, in terms of relevant expenditure on which rate support grant is based, an overall net reduction—as there has been for several years over the last decade. If in such circumstances a local authority was nevertheless planning for growth, that would seem a prima facie argument for at least an explanation of whether there were special circumstances to justify growth, at a time when the overall expenditure of local authorities was meant to be on the downturn.<br><br>
It would be wrong to say that growth per se was excessive and unreasonable. There might have been a change in the political complexion of the authority or changes in the demographic composition of the population which produced natural increased demands to which the local authority had to respond. But there might be other factors which did not come within these criteria and if, at a time when the overall resources were being reduced, a local authority was planning for growth—I do not mean just marginal growth: we are talking about considerable sums of money—that might be a relevant factor which the Secretary of State would wish to take into account.<br><br>
I say without any qualification that certainly the Secretary of State will be interested in questions of growth in coming to a view as to whether an authority should or should not be considered as appropriate to come under these powers. It will, of course, be one of the relevant factors, and it would obviously be pointless for anyone to believe otherwise.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked a specific question about the reference to "any preceding year". I do not wish to dissent from his general comments on that I think that we are faced with a situation in which the Secretary of State will be proposing to act at the time of budgets, and therefore the sort of information which would be available from other comparable authorities would also be their own budgets. If one were looking at the budget of the authority against which he was proposing to act and comparing that with its previous expenditure over a previous year, if one were wishing to compare it with a comparable authority, it would be an undue restriction to restrict the comparison merely to the comparable budget. That might be to the advantage of the Secretary of State, but it might also be to the disadvantage of the local authority. It would depend on the circumstances. Therefore if, in the case of the authority against which the powers might be used, it was relevant to look both at the budget and the expenditure of the previous year, I am not sure that there is any logical reason why it would 'be in anyone's interest not to be able to make the same comparison if one were looking at other comparable authorities.<br><br>
If one accepts the principle, which the hon Gentleman did, that it may be inevitable that comparisons will be made, it seems right and proper that the comparison should be as evenhanded as possible. If one is able to look at the expenditure of the local authority against which action may be taken so far as the preceding year is concerned, clearly it is necessary in everyone's interest that that same comparison be made with other local authorities. It might be a perfectly legitimate explanation for growth in the case of a particular authority that, while the budget compared with that of another authority might seem excessive if one looks at the past record, the comparison may be being made with an authority which traditionally had a very low level of spending in that area, and therefore that the comparison should not be made.<br><br>
I do not think that there is any logical reason why one should exclude both budget expenses and the actual expenditure of the preceding year in the case of a comparable authority. I hope that that clarifies that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's clarification, which we shall read with interest in <i>Hansard,</i> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 7, line 8, leave out from "are" to "closely" in line 9.<br><br>
Continuing our brisk gallop—no doubt commend-ably brisk, in the view of the Under-Secretary—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A trot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer the dignity of "gallop", which is a much more neutral word to use on the Labour Benches.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Continuing our gallop, we come to the amendment, which is intended to remove the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
This is largely a drafting amendment, but it has serious undertones, and there are one or two points that I wish to ask the Under-Secretary about.<br><br>
First, there is the simple point that at one level it might be argued that the phrase is redundant. As amended, the provision would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may … have regard—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) to the expenditure or estimated expenses, in that or any preceding year, of other local authorities which are … closely comparable … with the local authority concerned".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
It does not seem to me that
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
adds a great deal to the meaning of that. It follows from the fact that it is the Secretary of State who "may … have regard". By definition, unless something specific to the contrary were written in, it would be bound to be his opinion that was to be the conditioning factor. So at one level I should have thought that it was merely verbiage, which adds little to our understanding of the clause. On the splendid principle that an unnecessary line in a clause is a bad line, one is tempted to argue that it should be taken out as being purely redundant.<br><br>
However, having mentally noted down that argument, I thought that there might be a little more to this than had at first met the eye. Perhaps we may ask the Secretary of State to comment on some other possible implications of the appearance of the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Presumably the phrase means, if it is meant to mean anything, that it rules out the possibility of any other independent voice being taken as the genuine yardstick.<br><br>
Let us assume for the sake of argument that the Secretary of State produces a report which makes it clear that he is rejecting any arguments about comparability which may have been put forward by the local authority as a defence. The fact that we are stressing that it is only the opinion of the Secretary of State that counts might be taken to mean that the Secretary of State did not have to accede to normal levels of accepted wisdom on this point. Presumably, comparability is an objective standard where one would expect there to be some consensus, general agreement, or else the whole term would be meaningless. But what we appear to be doing here is substituting for that general consensus, for that general understanding of what comparability might involve, the much narrower and much more personal view that it is only the opinion of the Secretary of State that matters.<br><br>
It may be a fine distinction, and it may be just a bit of a grumbling nuance underneath the text of the clause, but—either because it is unnecessary, or because it excludes general agreement and general standards of what amounts to comparability, and substitutes for them the Secretary of State's personal predilections, prejudices and peculiarities—it seems to me that it would be better to expel this phrase from the clause.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
It is not perhaps a matter of great importance. Maybe the Secretary of State will say that it does not make much difference anyway, but in that case, and because the provision that the Secretary of State "may … have regard" leaves it entirely in his discretion in any event, the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
is redundant. If it is not redundant on those grounds, it seems to me that it is narrowing the normal definition of comparability in a way that we could do without. Therefore, the Committee should accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Fiiend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I had doubts about this phrase. My first reaction was that if the words are left in there is no doubt in the minds of local authorities, the Labour Party or anybody else that it is the Secretary of State that is taking this punitive action. That is a political point. What my hon Friend says has much substance. The words seem unnecessary, and the Minister may be able to accept the amendment.<br><br>
In what circumstances are the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
needed?<br><br>
I know that the Government never respond to hypothetical cases, but let us talk about the Kilmacolm line,, although I must confess that I do not know the technical or financial details. I do not know anything about the buses or the transport service. Maybe I do not know anything about the Kilmacolm line either, but I understand that there could be a decision by the local authority to continue payment by way of subsidy to the Scottish transport group, British Rail or the Edinburgh transport services to keep specific services going.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has to lay information against an offending authority, and he has to make it public. Will he then say that it does not matter whether the authority has decided that it will subsidise a particular railway line, bus service, or whatever, that in the opinion of the Secretary of State that should not be done? Whatever else might be said, that is one thing that he will not allow ratepayers' and taxpayers' money to be spent on. Are the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
necessary, bearing in mind that this is a discretionary clause and nobody will be able to force the Secretary of State to take advantage of these powers? Is that; the kind of detail that could be picked up only if the words remained in the clause?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the Bill will prevent a local authority carrying out the specific times of expenditure which it wishes to carry out and which it is lawfully entitled to carry out, irrespective of the Secretary of State's view. Even if the Secretary of State is ultimately successful in withdrawing grant from the local authority, he cannot veto that specific expenditure, even if he uses that as a reason why he thinks its overall level of support is inadequate.<br><br>
On the very hypothetical example which the hon Gentleman gave, all that the Secretary of State would be saying in coming to a view that the aggregate of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
expenditure of a particular regional council—Strathclyde in that circumstance—was excessive and unreasonable is "One of the factors which, in my discretion, I have taken into account is that your expenditure on X, comparable with that of other authorities, is excessive and unreasonable." If he did that and was successful in getting parliamentary approval, that obviously would lead to a withdrawal of £Y million from the local authority concerned. But it would not in itself prevent the local authority continuing with that item of expenditure of it felt that appropriate.<br><br>
In other words, the Secretary of State cannot veto the actual kind of work. All that he can do is to use that as the reason, or part of the reason, why the overall aggregate expenditure of an authority is to be considered excessive and unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very helpful, but does he not now realise how difficult it will be, because there is not another Kilmacolm line in Scotland with which to make a comparison?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That is why I do not think that Kilmacolm is the best example in discussing this provision. It would be very difficult for the Secretary of State to use this part of the clause as a justification for considering that particular expenditure to be excessive and unreasonable. This refers specifically to comparable authorities. If there is none, clearly it would not be in any way appropriate for him to do that. Unless one believes that the Secretary of State would simply invent comparisons which were clearly nonsense—and I do not think that anyone wants to suggest that—he would have to satisfy Parliament and put in public in writing his reasons for the comparison. If they were self-evidently nonsense, he would gain no support from any quarter.<br><br>
I followed very carefully the reasoning of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). In a sense he is correct that the wording is superfluous, if one goes by certain of the earlier draftings. For example, we are talking in this provision about whether the Secretary of State may, at his discretion, have regard to certain matters. If he is not of the opinion that the matters are relevant, he will not choose to have regard to them. So it goes without saying that if he has regard to them they are by definition, in his opinion, matters that it is right to have regard to.<br><br>
But there is another side of the same coin. If any precision is removed from the drafting, one could be in a position in which although the Secretary of State was of a certain opinion there was no guaranteed, scientific method of determining whether that opinion was justified. The hon Member obviously agrees with me, even if his reaction is slightly explosive. There is no objective standard. There is no scientific way in which one can come to an absolutely guaranteed conclusion on these matters, because we are not dealing with matters of science, biology or arithmetic. We are dealing with the criteria for "excessive and unreasonable," and one accepts that that is a matter of opinion, based on the evidence available.<br><br>
The hon Member for Garscadden will see that where, in clause 13, we refer to the mandatory matters
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
which the Secretary of State takes into account, a slightly different phrase is used:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the expenditure of that authority has been excessive and unreasonable".</p></blockquote>
There is an argument that "is satisfied" is exactly the same as "in the opinion of". The terms are so close in meaning as to be virtually interchangeable. Therefore, I am persuaded that there is an argument for uniformity in this matter in the various parts of the clause. There may be a sensible reason for removing the words "in the opinion of", but that would be to use the common term that occurs earlier in the clause.<br><br>
I am prepared to consider whether it would be more sensible to use the criterion of the Secretary of State's being satisfied, instead of the words "in the opinion of". That would be consistent with the phraseology in the other part of the clause and would give the degree of precision which is essential in matters of this kind.<br><br>
I hope that in the light of that explanation the hon Gentleman will feel able to seek to withdraw his amendment. I fully appreciate that he might prefer there to be no such words at all in this part of the clause, but I hope that he will accept that, given the references in other parts of the clause to the Secretary of State's being satisfied it is sensible to have uniformity. For that reason, a change of the kind that I have suggested might be the best compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been quite helpful. I would not regard as a major victory the substitution of "is satisfied" for "in the opinion of", but who are we to complain? However, does this mean that no outside advice will be sought in coming to the decision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be advice, particularly from the local authority most affected. As I mentioned earlier, the Secretary of State is required by statute to inform the local authority not only of his intention to withdraw grant but of his reasons. If he wished to use this part of the clause—the authority's expenditure as compared with that of other authorities—as part of the reason, he would have to spell that out to the authority, and it would have the opportunity, before any order was submitted to Parliament, to make whatever representations it thought appropriate. Inevitably that would be a public matter. There would not be a private discussion in secrecy. Other interested bodies with representations to make—trade unions, ratepayers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be very interesting indeed. We are in total agreement on that. There would be a public exchange of representations, and any other bodies with an interest would be able to add their input at that stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that the debate on the amendment has had some point. I am glad that the Committee agrees that there is no guaranteed scientific method of establishing the objectivity of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of any Secretary of State for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a phrase that I shall cherish. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
have a feeling that I may find a use for it at a later stage, perhaps in other circumstances. I note it with approval.<br><br>
I take the Under-Secretary's point about "in the opinion of" and "is satisfied". I put down yesterday—I hasten to say, Mr. Gourlay, that I mention this only in passing—amendments to clause 14, to which Government amendments appear inserting the phrase "of the opinion". I suggest that "satisfied" should be substituted in the interest of consistency with clause 13.<br><br>
When the Minister is making his agonised dicision about this amendment, perhaps he could also consider whether we should use "satisfied", which is neater and more concise, in clause 14, where I should have thought that the argument was exactly similar. The word "satisfied" in itself does not fit in very well. I do not know what the drafting amendment would be to replace
<br><blockquote><p>"in the opinion of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Presumably the words "to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State" would have to be inserted in paragraph (a).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That shows the hon Gentleman's usual clarity and precision of mind.<br><br>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division—I do not think that my hon Friends would want that—but I am not convinced that any phrase needs to go in there at all. It is clear from the preamble that the Secretary of State, and he alone, "may … have regard". The "may" is important here. The presumption, quite clearly, is that it is his criteria alone and his personal judgment which are at stake. There is no suggestion, for example, that the Controller of Audit, or some sort of outside body should be brought in to do the job. That might have been an improvement. We might have thought of that as a possible amendment, but we did not. It is clear, on any commonsense interpretation, that it does not matter to what extent contrary opinions rain down like confetti; it is the Secretary of State alone who will take the decisions, and those representations may be no more than waste paper.<br><br>
In those circumstances, I genuinely believe that the words that we are discussing are redundant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dealing with representations from the local authority affected it might not be a question of all-or-nothing. The local authority would obviously be arguing that no penalty at all should be put against it in terms of the withdrawal of rate support grant, because none of its expenditure was excessive or unreasonable. While the whole of its argument might not be acceptable to the Secretary of State, it might be able to show reasons why certain parts of what were alleged to be excessive and unreasonable expenditure were nothing of the sort.<br><br>
The Committee has perhaps been considering this matter on an all-or-nothing basis—that the Secretary of State would reject all the representations or none of them. He might feel able to accept that certain of the items which he originally thought of as examples of excessive and unreasonable expenditure did not properly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
fall into that category. That would, therefore, give considerable value to the local authority's representations, even if it was not happy that its other representations had been unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that a quite interesting statement, because I had always understood from the Under-Secretary that we were looking at a global total—that what was being designated as excessive and unreasonable was the total expenditure of the local authority, that the Secretary of State would not be looking at the specific public transport undertaking or the home help budget, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is absolutely correct. I am saying that if the Secretary of State has come to a view that the global expenditure is excessive and unreasonable he then has to go on to give his reasons for that, and in giving his reasons he will clearly be pointing to certain aspects of the expenditure which have led him to this conclusion. If a local authority could point out to him that certain of the examples he had given were not excessive and unreasonable, for the reasons that it stated, that might affect his judgment as to what the global aggregate of excessive and unreasonable expenditure ought to be. Therefore, although he was still required to submit an audit to Parliament, the ordermight refer to a different total than he previously intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is fascinating. We have not discussed this aspect at any time, and I do not intend to do so in any great detail, because it will be the principal point of a stand part debate. However, perhaps I may recap what the Under-Secretary has said, so that I understand him and can consider it before we come to the stand part debate.<br><br>
It would appear that what is intended is that the judgement as to whether expenditure is excessive and unreasonable will be made on an overall, global, bird's eye view of the total expenditure of a local authority. But the second stage—deciding what is to be ripped back as a punitive sanction in terms of a reduced rate support grant—will be done on the basis of an itemised budget. The global total of what is thought to be unreasonable is £X million, being made up of so much on this service, so much on the next service, and so on. Those are added together, and unless the Secretary of State is persuaded by the representations to knock out a particular service, that is what the clawback will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not quite put it in the way that the hon Gentleman has suggested. He is suggesting, as it were, a balance sheet of specific items that all add up to a specific grand total. I do not think that that is what is proposed in this clause or that it would have been the effect of the existing legislation under the 1966 Act.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State submits, as he must, his conclusion to the local authorities for their comments, and ultimately to Parliament, he will give his reasons for coming to that conclusion. Let us take the example which the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) gave, and suppose that one of his reasons was that, in his view, compared with other authorities,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
there was excessive support for all transport in that region. This is a purely hypothetical example. The local authority might then say "Wait a moment. You said that supporting the Kilmacolm line was excessive and unreasonable compared with other authorities. But there is no comparison that is proper. You have misled yourself in believing that there are comparable authorities in this area. Therefore, it is quite wrong to use this as a factor in coming to your judgment." If the Secretary of State then realised that it was absolutely right and he had been misinformed or had misled himself on that aspect, that might affect the global total of what he was paying was excessive and unreasonable expenditure.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that there is a detailed breakdown in terms of pounds and pence for every item, but obviously the representations from the local authority might be partly persuasive, even if they were not wholly persuasive. It would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to say that, because some of its representations were justified, but some were not, he would insist on the whole original reduction in the RSG being continued with. That is not something that the Committee would wish, nor is it what the Government would wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about this matter. 1 shall read what the hon Gentleman has said, and we shall have to come back to it, because it is fundamental. I merely say in passing that, if we make the global assumption of excessive and unreasonable expenditure, presumably that will be quantified against a yardstick, which the Minister will no doubt explain in due course. On the basis of guidelines, the comparability study or whatever, there will be a value judgement by the Minister that a particular local authority has spent in excess of reason by, say, 10 per cent., and that 10 per cent, will then have to be quantified in the report. It will have to be broken down into what it has been spent on, as I understand it, because the report will have to say that.<br><br>
Let us say for the sake of argument that that 10 per cent, represents £30 million. The Minister will inevitably have to say that that £30 million is made up of £5 million too much that has been spent on transport, £6 million too much that has been spent on social work, and so on. Then I understand the Under-Secretary to be saying that, the grand total of £30 million having been arrived at, it may be reduced to £25 million if spirited and effective representations are made by the local authority to the effect that £5 million of the sum as broken down in the report is unfairly included, because its social work expenditure, for example, can be justified in terms of the remarkably large number of retired people living within the authority's area. 1 do not see how one can escape from that kind of process if one is to assume that that 10 per cent, overspend which has been designated by the Minister in his initial bird's-eye survey of the scene has then to be explained in terms of actual spending totals in the report.<br><br>
We may return to this later, but perhaps the Minister will think about what I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so, but the hon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
Gentleman should appreciate that when the Secretary of State gives rate support grant to a local authority he is not, by doing that, determining how much it will spend on each individual item. In other words, although he will have made certain assumptions in the overall rate support grant for Scotland—and that can be broken down into likely figures for individual authorities if they wish—there is not an exact correlation between what they are able to spend on a particular service compared with what the Secretary of State feels appropriate. Therefore, there is not at present an exact scientific relationship between the rate support grant and the actual expenditure of an authority on the service for which that rate support grant was provided. Therefore, the problem to which the hon Gentleman refers is not really as much of a problem as he perhaps thinks it to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall think about this and return to it, probably on Tuesday. I genuinely want to understand how this will all happen. When the Minister speaks on Tuesday in the debate on clause stand part, which I suspect is when we shall reach it, he might consider giving us a little model, verbally explaining it exactly, and taking us through a series of hypothetical circumstances to show exactly how this would work in terms of a local authority which was being subjected to the sanctions in clause 13.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your tolerance. We have gone a little wide of the amendment, but our debate followed very naturally from what the Under-Secretary said, and it will perhaps be helpful later.<br><br>
I return briefly to the amendment. I have explained that, in my view, the phrase "may … have regard" limits any considerations to the Secretary of State's own discretion, and the failure to specify anyone else whose opinion might be governing in the matter makes this phrase redundant. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will follow me when I say that I could see the argument if this were a criterion which was mandatory on the Secretary of State. Then it might be of particular importance doubly to underline the supremacy of the Secretary of State's opinion, in case someone went to the courts and said that comparability was a matter of general consent as to what was comparable, that the Secretary of State had taken an individual and peculiar view, and was in some way failing in his statutory duty. But there would be no point in raising that action because, even if someone could be convinced in commonsense terms that that were so, these criteria are purely voluntary. There is no obligation on the Secretary of State to apply them in any event, so any such action would be bound never to get off the ground.<br><br>
I leave the matter there, but ask the Secretary of State to look at it to see whether eight or nine words can be saved out of what will be a very lengthy and expanded section 5 of the 1966 Act. Even that very small concession might do something to raise a little thrill of excitement on the Opposition side, and give us the feeling that we are wanted.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 7, line 9, leave out from "comparable" to "with" in line 10.<br><br>
I must be forgiven if I have not been following matters as closely as I ought to have been, because of the confusion which has been created. But, to take the Minister's example of the Kilmacolm railway and the assumption that there are no other Kilmacolm railways in other local authority areas, it is not always possible to make close comparisons. When we were discussing the phrase with which the last amendment dealt, the Minister conceded that it was not always possible to make close comparisons. Therefore, it is not necessary in the very next phrase in the clause to have it included, because he has already conceded that this confusion can arise.<br><br>
We dispute that the last phrase is necessary, but if by the Minister's own admission this next phrase is covered by the previous one, I submit that this deletion is perfectly in order, because the phrase is redundant. The Minister has said that the eventuality which he wants to cover is already covered by the previous phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always regard it as part of the job of the Opposition to make life difficult for the Minister by relevant and legitimate questions. The supreme success is if we can get some Conservative Members to show an interest in what is going on. The trouble is that there are hardly any here, which makes life difficult. I had time during the debate on the last amendment to look at the <i>Official Report</i> of the last three sittings. Apart from two interjections—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman rose to speak to amendment No. 33. I do not think that the attendance of members of the Committee has any relevance to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. You are absolutely right.<br><br>
The point that I was going to make was that we have the unusual benefit in this Committee of having at least three counsel as members. We are dealing with whether these seven words should be in the Bill. The sole contribution of the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) in the past three sittings was "He is not alone".<br><br>
<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 27 January 1981; c. 179.] That was a profound statement. The only other comment in those three sittings was from the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), complaining that he could not get a pair, and you properly ruled that out of order, Mr. Gourlay.<br><br>
What I am suggesting is that in these deliberations the normal to and fro of debate is somewhat lacking, and we have to rely heavily on the Minister's official brief. 1 am not disagreeing with it, because I have not heard the reply on this amendment yet. But it would be interesting to hear some speculation as to whether the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or as closely comparable as is practicable" </p></blockquote>
are necessary.
I want to give two examples to see whether the words are relevant. The <i>Glasgow Herald</i> on 31 January
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
had a report, following a meeting that the Minister had with COSLA, about publication of staffing figures. It seems to me that some agreement has now been reached about the publication of staffing figures. As I understand it, about 70 per cent, of all government expenditure goes in salaries and wages.<br><br>
I presume that there has now been some agreement to publish these figures. What is the intended use of the information? Is it merely to enable the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) to make another speech at the weekend on behalf of the Conservative Party, or to enable the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) to appear on Radio Clyde and thunder away at the bureaucrats in local government, or is there some real purpose behind it?<br><br>
Will the Minister come clean about "comparable"? It is almost impossible to make the comparison, whether it is based on the standard of services given or the cost of providing a comparable service. The Secretary of State will be in considerable difficulty having to appear in public to substantiate the action that he is proposing to take. Either it is for real or it is just a political gimmick to satisfy some of his more reactionary friends—he has many, even though we do not hear from them.<br><br>
I know that there are big money-spenders in terms of resources in local authorities. I do not mean wasteful spending. Strathclyde, Lothian, and, in the districts, Glasgow and the four cities are the big spenders. Therefore, obviously, they are most likely to be the targets for the exercise.<br><br>
Why is it necessary to have the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or as closely comparable as is practicable"?</p></blockquote>
Have they any real purpose or sense, when we all recognise that it will be extremely difficult to obtain any examples that make sense by way of comparison, because so many factors will have to be taken into account?<br><br>
Let me give two brief examples of what I mean. I was forced to read the Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i> last night, in the absence of the Glasgow <i>Evening Times.</i> Talking about the police, the <i>Evening News</i> said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Police in Edinburgh will be adopting a 'softly softly' approach at Murrayfield".</p></blockquote>
The article goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Anyone blatantly breaking the new rules"—</p></blockquote>
that is a new way to describe the law—
<br><blockquote><p>"made under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, would be liable to arrest."</p></blockquote>
The secretary of the SRU is quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is the job of the police on duty at Murrayfield—and on the traffic routes—to enforce the law and, if the circumstances demand, to take action."</p></blockquote>
The article states that the normal turnout of police will be 230 officers. I find it incredible that when the rest of the country is watching to see how the new powers in a major piece of legislation will operate the Lothian police will apparently not have any additional force on duty at one of the biggest sporting events in Scotland next Saturday.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The point that I am making—and you may relax, Mr. Gourlay, because it is relevant in deciding whether the words in the Bill are necessary—is that we should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
consider the difficulty of making comparisons, even when we have the staffing figures between one police force and another. I do not know whether Raith Rovers have a home game on Saturday, but I imagine that the attendance would not be so great that additional police would be required there. I am making a serious point about the difficulty of making comparisons.<br><br>
The grounds for the complaint of misuse or the excessive and unreasonable use of resources will have to come out in some of the discussions somewhere in public and they will have to be on the basis of "closely comparable" as the amendment suggests and not on:
<br><blockquote><p>"as closely comparable as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
The fact that the Secretary of State has to produce something in public will mean that the grounds will need to be practicable, because he will be laughed out of court.<br><br>
I should like somebody to have thought out under what circumstances *he words will be necessary. Some parliamentary draftsman may say that the words are in a previous Act, as is the case 99 times out of 100. I do not know whether -the words are new. The powers are new, so the words might be new. If so, my words might be just as good as the parliamentary draftsman's, because they have to relate to what the Secretary of State is doing. What is the difference between "closely comparable" and:
<br><blockquote><p>"as closely comparable as is practicable"?</p></blockquote>
Let me give an example related to the closure of schools. I shall quote from <i>The Scotsman.</i> I might even gat a word in <i>The Scotsman</i> after all the publicity I give it in the Committee. It says that there are already plans to close 10 schools, six of them in Glasgow. None is in my constituency, though Castlemilk and Priesthill are mentioned and closures will soon be coming in the areas that my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and I represent. But how do we make a comparison between Glasgow and the Western Isles where they are to close a school in Harris when the single pupil moves on to secondary education? How does the Secretary of State make such a comparison? Is it practicable to compare a school in Castlemilk with a remote school such as the one in Harris which has only one pupil?<br><br>
I know that we shall return to the general point in the debate on clause stand part, but I feel that these seven words are totally unnecessary, because if the Secretary of State, at his discretion, exercises the powers the fact that there ds a public examination, will mean—and this is not a threat, because I certainly do not speak for Lothian or for anyone other than myself—that the Secretary of State will have to be put through the hoop in detail. Therefore T think that the words are unnecessary in the context of making comparisons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) on his ingenuity. As is well known, when we see the amendments that are to come before the Committee, I and those who advise me seek to anticipate the sort of arguments and examples that may be put to the Minister in order that we may provide an appropriate explanation. Today we must confess total
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
failure. Not for one moment did we anticipate that the number of police who will be required at Murray-field on Saturday might arise from whether the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"as closely comparable as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
should be included in the Bill. The hon Gentleman will be aware that on this occasion, if on no other, the gentlemen of the press are present and no doubt will have listened to his words.<br><br>
There will not be only 230 policemen at Murray-field. My hon Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for sport will also be there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State for Scotland be there as well?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to advise the hon Gentleman on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his hip flask?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if my right hon Friend is there he will be without his hip flask. I turn to the amendment. The question is whether the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or as closely comparable as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
should be included. The Committee will see that the clause states that the Secretary of State shall be able to take into account
<br><blockquote><p>"the expenditure or estimated expenses … of other local authorities which are. in the opinion of the Secretary of State, closely comparable (or as closely comparable as is practicable)".</p></blockquote>
Therefore he is required to compare one local authority with another. Clearly in the case of certain authorities it would be difficult to make any comparison. One the one hand, there are all the authorities in the central lowlands of Scotland, which in many respects are comparable in that they have relatively dense populations, relatively similar problems in some areas and are all within a relatively compact geographical area. However, there are other authorities that are literally unique. Clearly the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, and the Highland region, are obvious cases. It would be difficult to say that the Highland region is comparable with any other authority. It has long bean recognised 'hat that is so. However, in many areas of its expenditure it could be comparable with other parts of Scotland. For example, the problems of the sparsely populated parts of the Highland region are not significantly different from those of the sparsely populated parts of Strathclyde region.<br><br>
It would be reasonable to look at the expenditure of, for example, the Highland region on transport for the islands off the west coast of Scotland and the comparable expenditure of Strathclyde region for the island communities in Argyll, which in all social and demographic respects are similar to the islands off the north coast, which are in the Highland region. Therefore, when we use the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"as closely comparable as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
it would be absurd to compare the Highland region as a whole with Strathclyde region as a whole. That would be a total nonsense. However, if we were concerned with a particular area of expenditure, once the total aggregate had been thought to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0710">Image</span>

excessive and unreasonable, and the Secretary or State were giving reasons to, for example, the Highland region why it was thought 'that a particular area of its expenditure could be used as an example of the reasons for the excessive and unreasonable nature of its aggregate expenditure, it might be sensible to compare its spending with that of an authority that is as closely comparable as is practicable, given the sort of expenditure and regions that we are talking about. Those are the circumstances in which it might be appropriate and that is why I feel that the words are sensibly included in the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is almost in the form of an intervention although the Minister has, in fact, sat down. My worry is that we have a principle of comparability which we all accept must enter into the argument. There is no dispute about that, but it is comparability that is qualified by the fact that the only judge of comparability is the Secretary of State. That is, perhaps, bad enough, but we have to live with that, because it is, after all, a system in which the Secretary of State is going to be the master. He will be the tyrant; he is the man who will take the decisions. We have to accept that, but we now have a further qualification built in. It is not comparability simpliciter, but comparability as far as is practical. This seems to be opening things up far too much.<br><br>
I am particularly interested in what the Under-Secretary has said about the possibility of making comparisons on a part basis. In other words, one is able to fragment the global view of an authority and look at its activities in respect of, let us say, sparsely populated rural areas and compare them with activities in respect of sparsely populated rural areas in other authorities which are not comparable in other ways.<br><br>
I want the Secretary of State to address his mind to the fact that the provision that we are discussing is the means of determining action under the earlier part of the clause. It is a way of determining whether the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is excessive and unreasonable expenditure.<br><br>
We have gathered from what the Under-Secretary said that when deciding whether expenditure is excessive and unreasonable, the Secretary of State will have to take a global view. He will not be looking at specific items of expenditure, but he will be able to look at geographical fragmentation, even though he will not be able to look at fragmentation into services. That seems a little difficult to follow. I can see that at a later stage—once it has been decided that there is excessive and unreasonable expenditure and when it has to be reported—it has to be broken down in the process that the Under-Secretary was explaining earlier. Clearly, that is part of the decision whether expenditure is excessive and unreasonable on a global term and, therefore, it worries me that we should be talking about fragmentation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could give the hon Gentleman an example. I am using the example of Highland region, but I give the assurance that it is totally
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
hypothetical; I am simply using it for purposes of illustration.<br><br>
Suppose the Secretary of State came to a view that the proposed expenditure of Highland region was excessive and unreasonable and let us assume that the only reason he had come to that view was the degree of financial support which the authority was giving, or the growth in its support for subsidies, to transport to the island communities off the west coast of Scotland. That was the only reason, but it was a substantial factor which led him to conclude that the expenditure was excessive and unreasonable.<br><br>
For obvious reasons, it is not possible to compare Highland region in its entirety with any other local or regional council. If, however, the reason that I have outlined were the sole reason why he felt that Highland's overall aggregate expenditure was excessive and unreasonable, it would not be unfair, improper or unreasonable that he should make a comparison with the level of support that, for example, Strathclyde region was giving to similar island communities with similar problems.<br><br>
Let us assume that the Secretary of State wanted to use that comparison as an example of why he had come to the view that that particular area of expenditure was excessive or unreasonable. Of course, it would be appropriate for Highland region to respond by explaining what differences there were and why it thought that the comparison was invalid. Strathclyde could comment that it also thought that the comparison was invalid, but it is surely not improper for the possibility of that sort of comparison to be raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Dear me", is my only comment. We have got to the truth of the matter. I do not have the report of Second Reading of the Bill in front of me, but I distinctly remember my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) intervening to ask whether the Secretary of State, when deciding whether it was excessive or unreasonable, would look at the public transport services and policies of the Lothian region. The example was purely hypothetical and I am sure that it is not necessarily in the mind of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that there was no way in which he would quarrel with the way in which a service was run. He said that that was out of the question and that he was concerned only with the global expenditure of the authority.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
If that is so, the Under-Secretary cannot say that he might decide that the Highland region's expenditure was excessive and unreasonable, with his only reason being that it was spending too much on support for sea transport services. That is getting back to what the Secretary of State specifically ruled out on Second Reading, namely making a value judgment about a specific line of policy and its financial applications. That will happen. That is the irrefutable logic of the past half-hour of discussion. We might as well have it from the Under-Secretary now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is getting a little lathered up unnecessarily. Perhaps it was my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
fault for over-simplifying an example. When one has to give an example, one inevitably over-simplifies and that, presumably, has created the problem. I wanted to simplify it as much as possible in order to illustrate the sort of possibility to which the phrase might refer. I shal simplify it again, though I know that that has dangers.<br><br>
Let us assume that the Highland region's expenditure was considered by the Secretary of State to be £50 million above what is a reasonable level. Let us also assume that the only reason why it was £50 million above anything that was remotely reasonable in terms of its relevant expenditure and guidelines and all the other factors that might be taken into account was that it had decided to have £50 million growth in support of the shipping subsidies to the island communities.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State decided to take action and had to indicate, as he will have to, the reasons why he thought an authority's expenditure was "excessive and unreasonable"—I am using an oversimplified example; obviously in the vast majority of cases it wil not be as simple and straightforward if problems arise—he will obviously have to indicate that he has not been able to overlook the fact that in one particular area of expenditure, namely the shipping subsidies to the island communities, it has decided to go for growth of £50 million. It would be ludicrous to avoid saying that and it would be misleading if that is why the aggregate is wildly above the appropriate level.<br><br>
Of course the Secretary of State has to give reasons, because that is his statutory obligation. But to interpret from what I accept is an over-simplified example the sort of consequence that the hon Gentleman was suggesting is unfair. What my right hon Friend said and what I have said all along in Committee is that we look at the aggregate of expenditure. If, and only if, the aggregate of expenditure is excessive and unreasonable, we shall have to indicate why we have come to that conclusion—we are bound by statute to do that—and the reasons will obviously relate to the aspects of the budget or the expenditure that contribute to the excessive aggregate. It is so self-evident that I have difficulty in seeing what is causing the confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not self-evident. It is a fascinating argument and I will try once again to simplify it for the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
It seems to me that there can be two approaches to that task. One can say that one will take a global view, and one may come to the conclusion that a local authority is spending in an excessive and unreasonable manner. That presupposes that one has some yardstick about total expenditure, given the total circumstances of that local authority, which allows one to quantify the excessive and unreasonable expenditure. What I suspect will happen, and everything that the Under-Secretary has said has reinforced my view, is that it will in fact be done by a series of examinations of specific areas of activity, saying, "That is unreasonable; this is unreasonable; that is unfair to the ratepayer; this is unfair to public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
expenditure" and so on, and that that will then be aggregated.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary may say that he might be in a situation in which the daftest public spending policy towards, let us say, the buses was being followed, but, because compensating economies in other areas had been made, there would be no way in which excessive and unreasonable expenditure could be diagnosed. I understand that argument. But it would then be necessary to advance the argument for excessive and unreasonable expenditure in different terms from those of merely aggregating individual services in the way that has been described. The Minister wil have to produce his criteria, which have nothing to do with the bus services, the social work services or anything else, but will have to be the overall global view.<br><br>
If it were so, it is illogical to say that the individual services would be the basis on which the claw-back was calculated. It would have to be overall excessive and unreasonable expenditure, which the Under-Secretary argues is not related to the individual budgets for bus services or whatever. The difficulty is that the Under-Secretary has tried to have his cake and eat it. He stoutly maintains, despite all the evidence, that there is a global view and a yardstick for reaching that global view which has nothing to do with individual services. But when he comes to explain what that excess is, he will do so in terms of the individual services. He cannot do both. It is a logical impossibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is correct. I could not do both, but I am not suggesting that one should wish to. Under (the existing law, local authorities, having fixed their budgets, are invited to send them to the Scottish Office, where they are considered. Under our proposals, the first thing that the Scottish Office will do is to look at the aggregate total of the budget. If it is close ito the guidelines or the other general factors that have been indicated—in other words, if it finds no prima facie evidence of excessive and unreasonable expenditure by looking only at the aggregate and not at details—it will look no further under the Bill's provisions. It will not be remotely interested.<br><br>
If, to use the hon Gentleman's own example, the Highland region had taken £50 million from its roads budget in order to put £50 million on shipping subsidies, that would not show itself in the aggregate. Therefore, if the aggregate were not excessive and unreasonable, no one would be remotely interested, for the purposes of the clause, in scrutinising further the budget of the authority. The fact that there might be tremendous variation within it—tremendous growth in one area and reductions in another—would not be of the remotest interest to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If, however, the aggregate—the simple grand total—suggested, prima facie, that there might be—not that there necessarily was—excessive and unreasonable expenditure, 'because it was dramatically above the guideline, clearly it would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to go no further than saying: "On the face of it, the budget is £X million above the guideline and I shall bring in an order to with—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
draw the -rate support grant". Of course lie must look at 'the budget in detail to see whether the expenditure is in fact excessive and unreasonable. It may be high because the guideline was unrealistic or because of some other factor that was not taken into account. Only when the Secretary of State has gone through the budget can he know whether what appears, prima facie, to be an excessive and unreasonable aggregate, is able to be portrayed as such. If he comes to the view that the prima facie case is proved by the contents of the budget, he is required, under existing law as well as under this provision, to give detailed reasons to the local authority concerned. That is the basis on which the operation will work. The hon Gentleman will agree that there is no other way in which it could be done. But I assure him that the resources of the Scottish Office are such that my Department will not waste a single hour going through the detailed budget of an authority if the aggregate suggests that there is no excessive and unreasonable expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to pursue the matter much further. It arose directly from the amendment, Mr. Gourlay, and I make no apology for pursuing it so far . I am left with the strong impression that it will all be expediency and subjectivity on the part of the Secretary of State of the day, and that the investigation that follows will be hudged and mudged together in such a way as to get the political result that the Secretary of State wants. The proof of the pudding will be the eating thereof and we will watch very closely.<br><br>
I return in any event to the simply expressed point of my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) which is that the further qualification seems to be redundant in terms of the argument that the Under-Secretary was using in the previous amendment and it should come out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 7, line 12, leave out paragraph (b)<br><br>
Paragraph <i>(b)</i> refers to "general economic conditions". It is extremely vague and is certainly yet another extension of the discretionary powers of the Secretary of State to throw in pretty well anything that he wishes. He can use any of the economic indicators including, for example, unemployment, inflation and economic growth. It is rare that we can get all those indicators working in harmony. The Government have chosen as their priority to try to reduce inflation in order to improve general economic conditions. Some of us have grave doubts about the thrust of their policies and we hope that we will be able to participate in this afternoon's debate on that matter.<br><br>
Some of us also believe that local authorities can improve general economic conditions by pursuing particular patterns of expenditure. The Secretary of State is disputing that, and the obvious case is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
Lothian region, which is seeking to reduce unemployment by having a level of expenditure which the Minister would probably consider to be unreasonable and excessive in certain areas. However, the general economic conditions in Lothian region may be improved by the fact that there are more people in employment than the Minister would consider to be desirable.<br><br>
When talking about general economic conditions, we could be covering a very wide range of possibilities. We think that the provision is not nearly specific enough and that pretty well anything could be thrown in as an excuse for the Minister taking on board the argument that the level of expenditure was unreasonable and excessive. We do not think that it is satisfactory.<br><br>
I am sure that there are other pieces of legislation in which "general economic conditions" are used and the phrase has probably been used by Labour Governments, but that is no justification for including it when the Minister is assuming almost draconian powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a straightforward point and I hope that I can reassure the hon Gentleman. He is certainly right in anticipating that the phrase is not novel to this legislation. In fact, it is relevant not just to other legislation, but to the original calculation of the rate support grant, because under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975, passed by the previous Government, in taking into account the proper level of rate support grant overall, one of the specific factors that the Secretary of State is required to take into account is general economic conditions. Schedule 2 of the 1975 Act amendments the 1966 Act and refers to the need for developing those services—
<br><blockquote><p>"and the extent to which, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services".</p></blockquote>
Given the fact that that was taken into account in determining the original rate support grant, it is obviously equally relevant if there is to be any question of reducing that rate support grant to a particular authority.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Under-Secretary will explain how this phrase is normally defined. I accept that it crops up constantly in official documents and statutes. I have never been entirely clear what its limitations are. It might be, for example, the general economic condition of the local authority, of Scotland or of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The world?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is going too far, because the Government do not have responsibility for the world. The world is no doubt relieved to know that the present Prime Minister is in charge not of the entire globe, but merely of one small part of it.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary will accept that there might very well be a circumstance in which very high expenditure was necessary in terms of the local auth-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
ority itself—high unemployment, urban deprivation—yet in the Government's view of the Government there might be a case to force down the local authority's spending in the national interest, never mind how good the case might be in local terms. Many of us would argue that we are in that situation at the moment, and the Government imagine that that is national interest and are victimising local considerations for that purpose. It would help if the Minister could explain a little.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will always be relevant for a local authority to indicate its own special circumstances in response to any desire of the Secretary of State, but there is no doubt that the phrase "general economic conditions", both as it appears in the 1975 Act and as it would operate in this clause, refers to national circumstances. It is clearly inserted in the 1975 Act, indicating that the Secretary of State, when determining in the first place the total amount of rate support grant, has to take into account not simply the needs of individual local authorities but the global amount which the nation as a whole can afford to contribute in rate support grant to the work of local authorities. Therefore, the phrase itself is national in its meaning, both in the 1975 Act and as to how it would operate in the clause. That does not preclude a local authority from indicating its own special economic circumstances in seeking to dissuade the Secretary of State from taking action, but the phrase itself is certainly as it applies in the country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Minister and the Oppposition will not come to an understanding on this. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 42, in page 7, line 12, leave out "(6)" and insert "(ii)"—<i>[Mr. Rifkind.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 7, line 13, leave out paragraph (c) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(c) the specific economic conditions and other social and demographic factors which apply in the local authority area concerned".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 35, in page 7, line 13, leave out paragraph (c).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By any standards we have made very fair progress this morning. One reason, on the Opposition side, was to leave a decent interval for the consideration of these two amendments, because they are of some importance. They deal with the criteria set out in paragraph (c) of the new subsection (1A). It is bold, simple, unmistakeable and unacceptable. It says that the Secretary of State may have regard
<br><blockquote><p>"to such other criteria as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
He could not write himself a bigger broader or more irresponsible blank cheque than that. The Opposition are totally opposed to the survival of that paragraph.<br><br>
There are two methods of approach which are both
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
worthy of consideration. The first of these amendments, which rather illogically and confusingly is No. 36 and not No. 35, wishes to delete paragraph (c) and to insert another version. We felt that there was a strong case for doing something to bolster and to define more clearly the legitimate interests, which I think the Minister concedes may well exist, in terms of the particular local authority. What we are trying to do in amendment No. 36 is exactly that, and at the same time to sweep away the objectionable, omnibus, catch-as-catch-can version presently in the Bill. The new words in paragraph (c) would have the virtue of being easily understood, being tied specifically to the local authority.<br><br>
That is important because the discretionary criteria in the new subsection (1A) deal largely with the point of view of the Secretary of State, and this is also dramatically so in paragraph (c). Paragraph <i>(b)</i> is general, when it talks of "general economic conditions" but the Minister has clearly explained that that is a criterion which allows the Secretary of State, in what he sees as the interests of his own national economic strategy, to ignore and overrule the wishes and expectations relating to the special particularities and peculiarities of the local authority concerned.<br><br>
It seems to us that there is value in having a new criterion, replacing the obnoxious paragraph (c) as it is presently drafted, which would be tied and devoted to giving a platform for the local authority to put its point of view. This would relate to the specific economic conditions in the local authority area concerned, because unfortunately there are many areas of Scotland where the unemployment situation is desperate and the deep recession created either unintentionally, through incompetence, or deliberately—I do not think it necessary for me to pass judgement at this moment—by the present Government's policies is having an extremely serious and deleterious effect. So it seems to me right to say that the economic conditions of the local authority should be specifically considered by the Secretary of State. After all, if the nation's economic conditions are relevant, so too should the local economic conditions in the area under examination and dissection.<br><br>
The same point applies to the social and demographic factors to which our new versions of paragraph (c) also refers. I do not think I need labour that point. It is quite simple and straightforward. We are suggesting that there will be urban deprivation, demographic factors, peculiarities of one sort or another which ought to be specifically referred to in these discretionary criteria. They should not be left as a vague consideration which may be prayed in aid but which has no specific platform in the legislation. It is in a sense redressing the balance. It seems to me that the criteria as presently defined are written very much from the standpoint of the Secretary of State, and this new version of paragraph (c) would do something to redress that balance.
Our proposal may not find favour with the Minister. It may take him a few minutes to recover them from the coffee shops or the Corridors, but he may try to mass his troops to rebut what I think is an adequately sensible proposal.<br><br>
I am interested to see that the hon Members for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
Moray and Nairn (Mr. Pollock) and for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) are at the moment immersed in a red book of some kind, I do not know exactly what it is. I doubt whether it is the thoughts of Chairman Mao, though that would be very interesting.<br><br>
If amendment No. 36 does not find favour with the Secretary of State, the Opposition will be anxious to press hard for amendment No. 35, which takes out paragraph (c) altogether. I say that because it seems to me that it is very insulting to put in something as wide and boundless as this particular form of words.<br><br>
I accept that from the point of view of local authorities this is a sour bargain at the best. What is being done here is the taking of very tough punitive powers which will be almost entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State. There would be very little defence against a Secretary of State who—I hope that we never have one such—was motivated purely by political prejudice, by unreasonable dislike of one particular group of councillors in one local authority. I am afraid that the ultimate sanction of the affirmative resolution of the House is a very poor thing on which to rely in this age of party discipline, and given the record of Conservative Members.<br><br>
In any event, I accept that there is little that we can do now, short, perhaps, of voting against the whole clause—no doubt we shall do that, but I fear that it may be in vain—to improve the situation. But at least in paragraph <i>(a),</i> discretionary though it may be, there is an attempt to write in and to define or limit the kind of considerations to which the Secretary of State must have regard, which would at least be some sort of platform for an argument against penal sanctions by the local authority.<br><br>
Subsection (1A) is supposed to be limiting, but the whole limitation is blown sky high and reduced to a farce when we spend hour after hour debating how the criteria should be drawn up, what is fair and what is not fair. We watch the Under-Secretary dancing on the head of a pin trying to explain to us what comparability and "economic conditions" mean. Then suddenly at the end, when perhaps we do not come to an agreement but at least we understand a little more what is in the mind of the Under-Secretary, and what will be allowable factors for the Secretary of State in reaching this decision, we come jolting up against:
<br><blockquote><p>"such other criteria as he considers appropriate.".</p></blockquote>
I could spend the next hour, Mr. Gourlay, but I shall not, dreaming up unlikely criteria which a malicious Secretary of State would see as appropriate. If he does, there is absolutely nothing that any of us could do.<br><br>
No doubt the Under-Secretary is confident that he is a reasonable man and that his political chief is a reasonable man. Hemay even be so confident as to assume that future Secretaries of State from his party will, if they are not reasonable, at least reflect his own particular prejudices, which he equates with reasonableness. I accept all that. But he might at least consider whether at some future date he might not find a Secretary of State who would look at this particular clause and use it as a hobby-horse to import into this unpleasant and, in our view, distasteful piece of legislation all sorts of criteria which were not dreamed of by anyone in this Committee or at any other time when these matters were under consideration.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
Therefore, I appeal to the Under-Secretary even now to consider giving us some concessions, that which we particularly want being amendment No. 35 and the deletion of this particular criterion, this omnibus, catch-as-catch-can provision. It is a threadbare attempt to undermine any pretence at fairness in clause 13. If he were to remove this provision, it would not reassure councils or reconcile them to the existence of this clause, but at least it would be some gesture to equity and fair-mindedness, which I believe would be welcome in councils throughout Scotland.<br><br>
The Minister is aware of this, because he is lonely and isolated with only his civil servants to talk to. I say appropriately at this moment that he is lonely and isolated because, across the board, across the whole range of opinion in Scotland, Tory and Labour, there is no doubt that there are no friends for this clause, and particularly no friends for paragraph (c). I confine myself to that. I do not want to promote a general attack on clause 13 in its entirety, but paragraph (c) has been singled out as obnoxious by COSLA, which I understand is speaking unanimously on this point. It was true of Tayside. It is as true of the agricultural smaller district councils which are run by the Minister's friends as it is of the big industrial battalions in Lothian and Strathclyde. They can all unite, because they all know that there is no possible justification for something as wide and as loosely drawn as this. It is an invitation to irresponsibility on the part of the present or a future Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
There are those of us who believe that there is virtue in statutory precision. People who read Acts of Parliament, whether they be lawyers, laymen, or councillors worried about sanctions under the clause, should be able to comprehend what is intended, and reasonable parameters should be set upon the actions of those who will implement them.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
What we have is a paragraph which makes it impossible to calculate, to understand or to define the limits on the discretion of a Secretary of State. Only he and his discretion will matter. That is bad for legislation as well as for the local government system. I ask the Under-Secretary to think again, and to consider whether he will essentially weaken the clause by taking away a provision which has an enormous number of enemies and absolutely no friends. I hope that he will look at this sympathetically and that he will give us this much-needed concession in the interests of good will in the local government system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have taken part in the debate this morning. There is so much in the clause which needs to be commented on that I wanted to restrict my remarks. On this amendment there has been a good deal of levity. But this is no occasion for levity. It opens the gate to dictatorship from the Scottish Office. I mean that. I do not use those words lightly. I do not know whether the Minister will say that these words are used in the 1966 Act or the 1975 Act. I do not think that they are. I doubt whether they are used in any other statute. They make nonsense of all the other provisions and qualifications in the clause or in any other part of the Bill.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
Let me remind the Minister of certain historical events that have occurred over the last few years—in my lifetime in this House. In 1956 Britain committed what is now regarded as an international crime when Sir Anthony Eden, then the Prime Minister, put British troops into Suez, because he was sick and did not know what he was doing. Before that, in the early stages of the war, a man called Captain Ramsay, who was a Scottish Member of Parliament, was put away because he was a friend of Germany and could not be trusted. There was another Tory Member of Parliament, now dead, Sir Thomas Moore, who was virtually a Fascist and a friend of Germany right up to the outset of the war. Any of those men could have been in charge of the Scottish Office.<br><br>
The paragraph says:
<br><blockquote><p>"to such other criteria as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
A Fascist handling Strathclyde or Lothian regions could say "There is a Labour-controlled authority. By God, we must put it in its place. The appropriate criterion is that it is Labour-controlled. That is sufficient for me." It is a catch-all phrase, with no spelling out of the criteria.<br><br>
We are talking about the mental condition of a Secretary of State at a particular time. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that he could go on for an hour talking about possible criteria. I could outdo him. Suffice it to say that the present Government have the confrontation complex about which I spoke on another occasion. If they do not like the political colour of an authority, that is a sufficient criterion.<br><br>
The Secretary of State may be dealing with "irresponsible" coal miners or unemployed people—I have plenty of the latter in my authorities' areas, as we all have. We have unemployed councillors, and they may be spending money. The Secretary of State says "These are unemployed people. We, the Government, have made them unemployed. But they have no right to spend ratepayers' money in the way they are doing. That is a sufficient criterion for me to stop 'em."<br><br>
Almost every organisation in Scotland—the EIS, COSLA, all kinds of organisations not of our political persuasion—has condemned the Bill and the blank cheque in this clause which my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden described as a threat to local democracy. And so it is. All the other provisions of the clause and the Bill pale into insignificance in comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend mentioned a number "f previous examples of people we might not like to see exercising this power. Will he spare a few moments to think about the situation if the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) were Secretary of State? After the personal vendetta that he has waged over the past few years against Lothian regional council, would he be able to carry out this provision with any propriety or objectivity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend makes the very point that I was trying to make with regard to the other people I have mentioned—all Tories and all extremely dangerous men, not only to Scotland but to the peace of the world.<br><br>
The hon Member for Edinburgh, South Mr. (Ancram) can make his case at length, either on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
this amendment or on clause stand part. It is not a laughing matter. He could be the Secretary of State. The hon Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) might be—and there is nobody here of a more fascist line than he. If he were Secretary of State he would use Political criteria. There is no doubt about that. It is a very serious matter, which deserves consideration.<br><br>
When we embarked on this debate we had two Conservative Back Benchers present. The Government did not even provide a quorum. The quorum was made up, and has been for long periods of discussion on the Bill, by the Opposition. If we walked out now there would just be a quorum. This is the measure of importance that the Conservatives attach to this threat to our democracy, our freedom—our local democracy.<br><br>
Our councillors are trying to do a responsible job in a responsible way and the Secretary of State says "we are going to put you in your place and we can use any criteria we like".<br><br>
The phrase "such other criteria" does not exclude anything—the colour of councillors' eyes, the colour of their hair. The Secretary of State is answerable to nobody; he need not take the advice of his Department or the civil servants. He thinks these criteria are appropriate, he and no other.<br><br>
When I look back at the quality of the Secretaries of State that I have laboured under in this House over the years, it is a terrifying thing. Some of those guys were more often drunk than sober. The Secretary of State might take his decision in an inebriated condition, and nobody has any redress. The paragraph allows him to say "These fellows in Strathclyde or Lothian are nasty—they are always sober." He is there on his high throne and he thinks he can do what the hell he likes-—and so he can under this provision.<br><br>
We shall have a lawyer's brief from the Under-Secretary. He will talk about the provision's being used responsibly and say that Secretaries of State are all responsible. They are not, in my knowledge. In any case, if they are they ought to come under some definable confines of behaviour. This provision gives the Secretary of State free rein to do what he likes.<br><br>
We shall certainly press this amendment to a Division, because it is a very dangerous power to give any Minister in any Government at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 36 seeks to include among the factors which the Secretary of State may take into account
<br><blockquote><p>"the specific economic conditions and other social and demographic factors which apply in the local authority area concerned".</p></blockquote>
I can see a perfectly good argument that those are circumstances which it would be relevant for the Secretary of State to bear in mind in considering the use of these powers. But the hon Gentleman will appreciate that the amendment ties us to the automatic removal of paragraph (c), and for that reason, plus the fact that we would like to look more closely at the specific words that he has proposed, I ask him to seek to withdraw that amendment. We would like to look very closely into the desirability of including an amendment of that kind among the conditions which may be taken into account by the Secretary of State.<br><br>

I turn to the more substantive matter in this grouping of amendments, and begin by commencing on the rather lurid contribution of the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), His main objection appears to be based on what might have happened if we had had a Fascist Secretary of State at various times in our past a drunken Fascist Secretary of State. I may say in passing that his reference to those with Fascist tendencies appeared to exclude the late Sir Oswald Mosley, who had been a Labour Cabinet Minister, but I will not comment further on that.<br><br>
I freely concede that the phrase is widely drafted and could incorporate many factors which the Secretary of State might wish to consider appropriate in reaching a decision. The hon Member for Fife, Central implied that somehow any crazy whim of the Secretary of State could be indulged and that was an end to it. He suggested that the political complexion of the local authority, the drinking habits of its members or such other arcane examples as he gave would be all that mattered. That is an absurd proposition. It is not simply a question of the Secretary of State's subjectively deciding that he does not like the political complexion of a particular authority, and therefore deciding to act against it.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
What the Secretary of State is required to do, once he has decided the criteria upon which he intends to act, is to put those criteria specifically to the local authority concerned. He cannot conceal the facts. In essence the hon Gentleman is suggesting that the Secretary of State would write to an authority and say "I have decided that your expenditure is excessive and unreasonable. You are entitled to know the reasons for that. It is because you are controlled by the Labour Party at the moment". If that were the criterion to be applied, it would have to be communicated to the local authority, and indeed to Parliament when the order was submitted for approval. One has only to express it in those terms to indicate how obviously irrelevant that sort of argument is.<br><br>
I am not saying .that that in itself justifies the provision. I am saying that the hon Gentleman has weakened his case by the extreme nature of his examples, because clearly these are criteria which have to be made public both to the local authority and to Parliament. One has only to use the examples which the hon Gentleman has given to show how unlikely that would be and how literally impossible it would be to assume that a Secretary of State, whatever his political views, whatever his particular prejudices—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not within the realms of possibility that the Secretary of State could make the decision for, say, a political reason, and the civil servants could cobble up some sort of explanation to put to the local authority and Parliament? For example, is it not even possible that the present Secretary of State has made the decision to close particular colleges of education for a particular reason, but different reasons are given publicly, because it would be embarrassing for him for the real reasons to be made public?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman proved my point. If any Secretary of State has secret reasons, and then gets his civil servants to cobble up reasons to satisfy the local authority, Parliament, or whomsoever, he does not need a provision of this kind. He does not have to have something in an Act saying that he may take into account any such criteria. I am responding to the suggestion .that he might wish to act in this way, that he might have secret, private reasons which he would never disclose in public. If I accept hon Gentlemen's hypothesis that that is how a Secretary of State might wish to act, if that hypothesis is at all justified, he does not need a provision in a clause saying that. If these are to be private matters, which he does not tell anybody about, it will not matter what is in a particular Bill if he is to behave in such a disgraceful way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing the point completely. What I am saying, with the support of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), is that the reasons may be disreputable, but the civil servants or whoever will cobble up the excuses for him will find it much easier if they have paragraph (c), because they can choose anything under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon Gentleman is incorrect. Any decision by any Secretary of State to use these powers has to be explained to the local authority and to Parliament, and it is the criteria that are indicated to the local authority and to Parliament that will be relevant in determining 'the outcome of the matter.<br><br>
There is another consideration. Let us use the hon Gentleman's extreme suggestion. Let us say that, despite the very slight likelihood, a Secretary of State were disposed to say "The Act gives me discretion to use any circumstances I like. Therefore, I shall tell the local authority that it is because of its political complexion. I shall be quite open about it. I happen to dislike that authority because it is controlled by another political party, and the Act does not appear in any way to restrict the basis on which I may apply my discretion". I presume that such a local authority would challenge the use of the discretion in that way in the courts.<br><br>
The courts will assume—there are precedents for this—'that the Secretary of State's criteria must be relevant to the general matter that he is deciding. There must at least be some prima facie relevance to the question of "excessive and unreasonable" 'expenditure. I think that the hon Member for Garscadden will not challenge the view that the courts would not find in favour of the Secretary of State, on an appeal by a local authority, if he said that the reason why he considered its expenditure to be excessive and unreasonable was simply that it was controlled by the Labour Party, or some other party. Assuming that the hon Member had not been briefed to appear on the Secretary of State's behalf, I am sure that, looking at it objectively, he would agree that the courts would not for a moment countenance any Secretary of State acting in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I particularly suspect the Minister's arguments when he is reduced to flattery.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon Gentleman does not disagree with the argument, and that is a most relevant factor. I accept that it applies only to the more extreme examples, but it was the extreme examples 'that the hon Gentleman chose to use, and I do not think that they are appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), but I certainly would not accept that the courts in Scotland are likely to be impartial in this kind of judgment. [Hon Members: "Shame."] I have had experience of appearing before a sheriff on exactly this kind of thing. It is my experience, and it has been the experience elsewhere, that—because of the education, the background and to some extent the upbringing and political understanding of the sheriff—ordinary people, particularly those in Labour-controlled local authorities, can expect no impartiality from him in such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the most disgraceful remarks that the hon Member has ever made, using the privilege that this House permits him to say what he chooses. He has not provided for the Committee one scintilla of evidence to support that disgraceful suggestion—the implication that the courts will always support a Conservative or Right-wing point of view. He nods in agreement to that, but he might like to explain, for example, the recent decision by an English court ordering striking prison officers to continue their industrial action, against the advice of their union and the clear wishes of the Secretary of State, because the interpretation of the union rule books brought the judge to that conclusion. I use that as just one example in recent weeks.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman is making a disgraceful suggestion—[Hon Members: "Hear, hear."]—that judges do not carry out their tasks impartially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Members who are cheering are all lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend may not be a lawyer, but neither is the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He should appreciate that if he, as a responsible Member of Parliament, has reason to believe that any judge in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom is allowing his personal political prejudices to influence his judgment there is a recognised way by which he can seek to have that judge removed. If he is not prepared to do that, and is not prepared to submit an item of evidence, he must concede that he is acting in a disgraceful and irresponsible fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should be made clear exactly what words I used. The Under-Secretary paraphrased them to "personal political prejudice". I did not say that. I spoke about the background, the upbringing and the political environment in which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
judges and the sheriffs in Scotland are brought up. I was talking about Scotland, and I think that the best evidence is all the decisions about catchment areas of Labour local authorities, including the judgment in Edinburgh by Sheriff Isobel Poole. I have criticised it on previous occasions outwith the privilege of this House, and I will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now we have the real substance of the matter. Because the hon Gentleman was baulked in his aspirations as chairman of Lothian region's education committee, because the courts took a view as to what the law of the land meant, different from that which the hon Gentleman would have liked them to take, he immediately interprets this as, in effect, political bias. The hon Gentleman nods agreement. It is a disgraceful suggestion, and the hon Gentleman should be ashamed of himself.<br><br>
Councillors, Members of Parliament and Government Ministers of both parties have on occasions found their wishes frustrated by the courts, which have interpreted the law. If on each occasion the law went against them—this has happened to the present Government, as well as to previous Administrations—they accused the judge of political bias, it would be a very sorry state of affairs. The hon Gentleman knows that a substantial number of Scottish judges, in the High Court, the Court of Session and the sheriff courts, come from a background and an association with a political party not very different from his own. Perhaps he should take that into account before he makes such sweeping remarks. I am sure that every judge in Scotland, irrespective of his political background, would condemn the hon Gentleman's remarks in the strongest terms.<br><br>
I turn to the relevant considerations before the Committee, the words on the Amendment Paper. Putting aside the extreme remarks that hon Gentlemen such as the hon Member for South Ayrshire have just been making, I accept that there is perfectly proper concern whenever in an Act, or proposed Act, words are used which, on the face of it, provide substantial discretion, unqualified discretion, to the Secretary of State in the exercise of his judgment. There clearly are matters which would be appropriate criteria but which are not specified elsewhere in the clause.<br><br>
I could give several examples, but I give one obvious example: the question of the guidelines to individual local authorities. The guideline is not strictly a matter that comes under the
<br><blockquote><p>"financial and other relevant circumstances"</p></blockquote>
of the authority, because it is not its guideline. It is a guideline which has been given by the Secretary of State. It is not a matter which relates to the general economic conditions in any straightforward way. If may be connected to that, but the guideline takes into account not merely the general economic conditions but the pattern of expenditure and need of the local authority itself, its demographic composition and a number of other factors of that kind. Also it clearly would not be a matter which was comparable with other authorities. I use that as a very obvious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
example of a criterion which I do not think anyone would genuinely disagree is appropriate.<br><br>
The Government remain of the view that this phrase provides the necessary flexibility for circumstances that we cannot envisage. Therefore, I ask the Committee to keep the provision in the clause. But I am prepared before Report stage to look closely at whether it is necessary to have such a wide phrase in the clause, to see whether by a further amendment it might be possible to specify in a way more acceptable to the Opposition the sort of criteria that should be taken into account. At this stage the Government are not satisfied that it would be appropriate simply to leave out that qualification, because there are a number of factors, such as guidelines, which we think are perfectly proper to be taken into account.<br><br>
I hope that the hon Member for Garscadden will allow me to give further thought to this matter. I am not giving him any assurances as to what the outcome of that consideration will be. I simply say that I recognise the deep concern which he and his hon Friends have expressed, and which has been expressed by local authorities. I hope that the hon Gentleman will feel that I am responding sympathetically to his point. I am prepared to look at the phrase again very closely, albeit without commitment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been endeavouring during the past hour or so to get into the mind of the Secretary of State for Scotland, which is not an easy task. I have been trying to think through what it was that persuaded him, the Minister, and the parliamentary draftsmen to insert these words into the Bill. It seemed to me that with what they had in paragraphs (a) and (6) they had covered the point that they wanted to make. I am interested in what the Minister said in his concluding remarks, and his colleagues must have thought through their position very carefully before they committed themselves as they have in what is written in paragraph (c). It seems to me that it is just the final turn of the screw. We have the turning of the screw in paragraphs (a) and <i>(b)</i> and then finally, because they could not think of anything else—it was probably 11.30 at night and they wanted to go home—when they were drafting the Bill they decided: "Ah, well, we'll just stick in there 'to such other criteria as he considers appropriate' ".<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Are not paragraphs (a) and <i>(b)</i> enough? The Government are not taking account of the fact that local authorities are elected, and that councillors have a mandate in their own right. One of my own local authorities, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council—since last May a Labour local authority, having swept away the worst district council in the country, when it got rid of the obnoxious SNP—has written to me making this very point, that the paragraph does not take account of the fact that councillors are elected in their own right.<br><br>
When I read the notes on clauses, so generously provided by the Minister, I did not find any adequate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
explanation for what the Government are doing, and we have not had an adequate explanation this morning. But I suppose we must be thankful for the fact that the Minister has said that he will have another look at the paragraph and see whether a more appropriate amendment could be devised. I welcome that, but it does not seem to answer the point totally or adequately, and I shall be interested to hear what my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has to say about this later.<br><br>
I entirely agree with the view expressed by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). His contribution was, as his contributions always are, reasonable and temperate. I associate myself with what he said, because we are talking about taking power. I have complained about this in this Committee, just as I complained about it in the Committee on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and on the Floor of the House when we debated the Employment Bill. Time and time again the Government erode freedom and choice.<br><br>
The Conservatives promised in their manifesto—I love to quote it, because they have so hypocritically abandoned what they said before the election—that there would be freedom of choice. The Prime Minister asked how anyone could deny that freedom in this country had been eroded. She put a time scale on that, which, of course, was intended to lay the blame on the then Labour Government. The truth is that this Government keep eroding the freedom and democracy on which this country is founded, not least in the area of local government. The thrust of that attack in Scotland has been on local government. Paragraph (c) is just another example of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister whether these words appeared in any other statute. He did not reply. With his wide experience in local government and elsewhere, can my hon Friend think of another statute where these words appear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unable to say that I have read the entire statute book. However, I can say that I have not come across these words anywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether this provision was included in the legislation passed last year for England, dealing with rate support grant settlements. It is significant that if a considerably less able Secretary of State for the Environment were given these powers it would have disastrous effects for the country, given his performance in the Chamber over the last few years. Perhaps the draftsmen in the Department of Environment took that into account and failed to include that provision in the English legislation. Therefore, we may well be in an even worse position than England in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I entirely agree with the fears expressed by my hon Friend. In further answer to my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central, may I say that I shall this very day go to the Library to see whether I can find this phrase.<br><br>
I had not intended to speak, but I was moved to do so by all that I had heard. I hope that the Minister will come back with an amendment, as he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
says he is considering doing. I hope that my hon Friend 'the Member for Garscadden will now probe further and persuade the Minister ito take up that reasonable position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has managed to generate a good deal of heat and not much light. He seized upon some chance remarks of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) with immense relief in order to get himself out of the difficulty of having to spend a sufficiency of time upon this obnoxious provision.<br><br>
I shall seek to withdraw amendment No. 36, the new version of paragraph (c). I take the spirit in which the Minister spoke as being helpful. Clearly, "the financial and other relevant circumstances" of the authority are part of the mandatory consideration in the earlier part of the clause. But prima facie there is a strong case for putting a form of words of the kind that we have outlined into the new subsection (1A). I accept that the Minister cannot do that now, because it would mean taking out the present paragraph (c), which he is apparently determined—I think wrongly and misguidedly—to keep in a state of suspended animation while he considers the matter further.<br><br>
Again, I am grateful for the suggestion that the Minister will look at the words <br><blockquote><p>"to such other criteria as he considers appropriate",</p></blockquote>
but I cannot think of anything that will maintain his position and which will be greatly reassuring to other people. However, I wish him luck in his search. A phrase such as
<br><blockquote><p>"to such other criteria as may be relevant"</p></blockquote>
strikes me as a form of words 'that might appeal to the Minister. I would regard that as a minor improvement, but perhaps not one of great substance. The best thing that the Minister could do would be to withdraw paragraph (c) altogether, for the reasons that I gave earlier, and in the context of the genuine anxiety and opposition that it has aroused throughout Conservative as well as Labour local authorities.<br><br>
At the end of the day, subsection (1A) is, as we have often remarked, discretionary. I think I once referred to it as the voluntary principle. It is a matter for the Secretary of State as to whether he looks at the criteria in paragraphs (a), <i>(b)</i> or (c)—if paragraph (c) survives. It may be offering too much of an olive branch to the Minister, because it may sound too conciliatory, but in one sense I do not think it would greatly weaken the position of the Secretary of State to take out (paragraph (c), but it would greatly strengthen it in terms of the spirit of the legislation and the way in which it was regarded. It will never be regarded with a friendly eye, but it would be a considerable gesture if he could see his way to removing this.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman asked me to seek to withdraw amendment No. 35. I do not think that I can do that. We must register our protest by voting, although we recognise that we will not succeed today. However, I am sure that that does not preclude the Minister from considering whether some other form of words—or ultimately the total withdrawal of paragraph (c>—would not be in the best interests of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
legislation and of his Administration and of his colleagues. I still urge that strongly upon him. I do believe that it is an untidy form of words, far too loosely defined. It opens vistas for irresponsibility. I do not mean that in the narrow sense that we will have irresponsible actions following from it, but it is irresponsible in the technical sense that it removes all controls and allows the Secretary of State a totally unbounded and unfettered discretion, which I believe is not in his interests or in the interests of anyone else.<br><br>
While seeking to withdraw amendment No. 36, I advise my hon Friends to vote in favour of amendment No. 35, while still urging that the Minister keep not an open, but a sympathetic mind, for the strong feelings that exist on this matter, not in this House, where sometimes rage can be synthetic, but throughout Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the reasons why the hon Gentleman wishes to divide the Committee, to emphasise the opposition that he and his hon Friends have to paragraph (c). I have indicated that I am prepared to look at it to see whether it is necessary. I cannot believe that it would be possible to remove the paragraph in its entirety, but I see that there can be a good argument for changing the wording to make it more specific, to reassure local authorities as to the spirit in which it would be applied. I shall certainly give close consideration to that.</span></p>
