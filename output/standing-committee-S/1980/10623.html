	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered Class XV, Votes 8, 10, 12, 15 and 24 and Class XVIII, Votes 5 and 8.—[	<i>Mr. Younger.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce Millan (Glasgow, Craighton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing local government finance this morning. The first thing that I want to say is that it is in a state of crisis—a worse crisis than I ever remember. The reason for that inevitable crisis has been the way in which the Government have behaved towards local authorities in Scotland in the past two years or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government line has been—and no doubt we shall hear some of it this morning—that they have been very reasonable, even generous, to local authorities, that they have had the interests of the ratepayers at heart and that, if it were not for a few extravagant authorities which have defied the Government, everything would be all right. To add to that kind of line, the Government have tried over the past couple of years to sow the maximum amount of confusion in the public mind, knowing that the general public do not always understand the intricacies of local government finance, with the aim of putting all the blame for the present situation on the local authorities themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, the reality of the situation is completely different from what the Government have been trying to present to a rather bemused public in Scotland. If we take, for example, the authorities which are budgeting in the current year to spend more than the Government's guidelines, we see that of 65 local authorities in Scotland, far from there being only a few extravagant authorities spending above the guidelines, 59 are above the guidelines. What is more, the expenditure of 41 out of the 65 is 10 per cent. or more above the Government's guidelines, and there
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
are 28 whose expenditure is 20 per cent, or more above the Government's guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines were never intended to be firm and absolute; only indicative to local authorities. They were never intended to be mandatory, but they were intended to be accurate. The reality is that, far from the problem that we are facing being the result of the extravagance of a few local authorities, the Government's figures are meaningless. What they have done over the past couple of years, as I have said on earlier occasions, is to pile artificial figure on top of artificial figure, so we now have a situation where the kind of figures that the Government are talking about are completely out of touch with the reality of local government finance at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic dishonesty of the Government in all their dealings with local authorities over the past couple of years has led to a breakdown of co-operation between local authorities and the Government because Ministers have not come clean with them. They have not been honest with them. They have not been honest with the public. They have treated the local authorities in a extremely dishonest way. That is the basic reason why local authorities—not just a few, but local authorities as a whole—are no longer seriously co-operating with the Government. The Government have lost their trust by the way that they have behaved over the past couple of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This dishonesty goes all the way through the rate support grant. It goes through the housing support grant negotiations as well. The relevant expenditure figures, on which the grant is paid, are utterly phoney. The Secretary of State knows that they are phoney and that they cannot and will not be achieved. That means that, as the Government pay grant on phoney figures, there is a real cut of grant, which the Government have not the honesty to admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have false inflation figures—false cash limits— written into the RSG settlement. That happened again in 1981-82, which the Secretary of State will not deny. I shall be interested if he denies it, because the costed figures demonstrate that in the current year most of the inflation cash limit figures have already been eaten up and there is very little left for inflation in the rest of the year. That also means a cut in grant. Added to the real inflation figures—which, whatever they are, are not the responsibility of local authorities but the responsibility of the Government—they present considerable problems for local authorities as for many other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current year we have had an explicit cut of 1 per cent, in the rate support grant. That, added to the cuts in grant over two years, which have been massive indeed, and in the current year a reduction in housing support grant of no less than a third, is the real reason why district and other rates have gone and are going through the roof. It arises directly from cuts in housing support grant, which again the Government have tried to hide, obscure and confuse with all sorts of figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which this has been done raises the whole question of central and local government relationships. The central Government's line at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
minute, put brutally, is " We decide policy and the local authorities simply follow us. We lay down policy from the centre. Whitehall and St. Andrew's House know best. As soon as we have decided what ought to happen, the local authorities are meant to follow tamely behind."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An even greater distortion is that that has always been the relationship between central and local government. That is historically completely untrue. What the Secretary of State ought to keep in mind is that local authorities in Scotland are elected, and they are elected on a sounder mandate than the election of the Government in Scotland. They have elected members. They have certain rights and responsibilities, and they are entitled to take a view about their own levels of expenditure. Local government always has been entitled to take a view about its own level of expenditure. Local authorities do not share the Government's view that at the moment it would be good for the economy and employment if we cut public expenditure even further. They take the view—which I too share—that further cuts in public expenditure at the moment are economically illiterate and damaging and will succeed only in adding to an ever-lengthening dole queue in Scotland which, when the figures are published today, is likely to go over 300,000. So they are against Government economic policy. They do not think that it makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They also notice that the Government do not seem to be particularly successful in cutting their own expenditure or keeping their own public expenditure under control. They notice that the Secretary of State for Defence cannot control the Defence budget, although it is on a rising curve. Unlike local authorities, which are asked to cut their expenditure, the Secretary of State for Defence is to be given more money by the Government, and even he is not able to keep his Defence budget under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all this there has been a breakdown in central and local government relationships. That has arisen because the Government have basically not tried to persuade local authorities. They have tried to bully and coerce local authorities into obeying the dictates of the Secretary of State and St. Andrew's House. They have done it with a complete lack of honesty all the way through the negotiations over the past couple of years. The great triumphant result of this for the Secretary of State, who keeps telling us sanctimoniously how worried he is about the burden on the rates, is a 32 per cent. increase in rates in Scotland in 1980-81, and in the current year a 36 per cent, increase, although we were told at the time of the last RSG settlement that it would be very much less in the current year and would be within modest figures. The result is that over two years the domestic rate burden in Scotland—quite apart from the burden on industry and commerce—has gone up from £149 on average to £271. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a council house, one will pay additional rent as well. A person who is buying his house on mortgage will be paying additional mortgage payments as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
The Government, having failed to achieve what they said was their policy of keeping down rates, have become desperate. We have had the recent Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, which has just received the Royal Assent. I shall want to say something about the hit list of seven local authorities. But, first of all, I remind the Committee that the justification for the provisions in the Bill was that it would allow the Government to be discriminatory. It would punish the so-called offenders, the bad boys, who were not doing what the Government told them, but others would be left to get on with their business and would not suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there are many offenders. As I have already said, out of 65 local authorities, 59 are offenders, and 28 are offenders to the extent of 20 per cent, or more. That includes the local authorities run by militants such as Bearsden and Milngavie and Lochaber, Banff and Buchan—for the edification of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). If one looks at the figures and the list of local authorities, one can see that these increases beyond the guidelines spread through local authorities all over Scotland. The highest figure of all is Shetland, which is 72 per cent. above the guidelines, and Orkney which is 40 per cent, above the guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government not punishing Orkney and Shetland? Why are orders not going out to Orkney and Shetland and to the other authorities I have mentioned, as well as to the seven? Why are there only seven on the hit list? Will there be more? I hope that the Secretary of State will tell us this morning. He has not told us so far. He has been very coy about it. But are there to be more? If there was any fairness in this situation and if the Secretary of State is not actuated, as I believe he is, largely by political malice, a large number of other authorities ought to be added to this hit list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question we want to ask the Secretary of State concerns the penalties for the current year. It was all to be discriminatory, but he is talking about clawing back £100 million, and the seven authorities account for only £63 million. What will happen with regard to the other £37 million? I think I can tell the Committee what will happen with the other £37 million. It will be a general clawback to every authority, regardless of how it has behaved. Whether an authority has attempted to meet the Government's guidelines or not, it will be punished in the current year. If that is not the situation, I hope that the Secretary of State will deny that this morning. But I believe that that is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to know what happens if the seven authorities respond to the Government. What will happen if they come back and cut their budgets by £20 million or £30 million. Is the penalty, the £100 million, reduced, or is it then distributed among the other authorities in Scotland? We are entitled to an answer. In other words, is the £100 million adjustable or is it an absolute figure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I heard the Secretary of State on the radio posing as a reasonable man. He said " If they come back and talk to us reasonably and negotiate, it will be all right. I shall not go ahead with these orders. It is all hurtful to me. I do not like doing it, because I am such a nice chap ", and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the authorities do come back and co-operate, will the penalty still be £100 million, or will he reduce it? I suspect that his instructions from the Prime Minister and the Treasury are to obtain £100 million one way or another. If it does not go on the seven authorities, it will go on all the other local authorities in Scotland. If that is not so, he has the opportunity to tell us this morning what his intentions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I believe is likely, there is to be a general clawback, there will not be a £100 million saving from the budgets in the current year. There is no way in which that can be achieved in the current year. Therefore, local authorities which have tried to co-operate will carry forward deficits to 1982-83.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to 1982–83. Some hon. Members may think that they have gone through a couple of years of purgatory at local ratepayer level and that next year will be all right. I want to disabuse them of that notion right away. First, the way in which the Government have behaved means that deficits will be carried forward from 1981-82. But, even worse, the Secretary of State is saying to local authorities " We intend to take another £60 million off your grant for 1980-81 by reducing the RSG for 1982-83." So they will have deficits brought forward and a reduction in their grants for next year, even before taking account of inflation or the expenditure limits set by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be 5p in the pound on the rates even before we start in 1982-83. I hope that hon. Members understand and appreciate that and will not come bleating next year about the local authorities imposing massive rate increases. What the Government are doing will make massive rate increases next year inevitable. The deficit from the current year represents 3p in the pound—the £37 million that he still has to get—and it may be more than that. The £60 million represents another 5p in the pound, even before we start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government are already looking for further cuts. They will cut these artificial figures and make them even more artificial in 1982-83. That, among other things, will mean an inevitable reduction in local authority employment in Scotland, thus adding to the dole queues. Yet, the Secretary of State for Scotland will boast this morning—the figures have not yet been published—that for the quarter to 31 March 1981 there is a reduction of 2,500 in local authority manpower. So he cannot claim that the local authorities are not attempting to keep expenditure under control, although, tragically, that reduction of 2,500 is simply adding to the number on the dole in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is more to come in 1982-83. The figures that the Secretary of State is now asking the local authorities to work to in 1982-83 in terms of education, for example, would mean the sacking of 6,000
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
teachers. If the Secretary of State cares to deny that figure—and I challenge him to do so—I shall be very interested. He knows that that is the COSLA figure. That will be the result of keeping education expenditure for 1982-83 down to the figures which he has asked the local authorities to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a worsening of pupil-teacher ratios. The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science has the brass neck to boast about the best pupil-teacher ratios ever. We have them only because the local authorities have not obeyed the Secretary of State for Scotland and cut their education expenditure. But next year 6,000 teachings jobs will be lost. I put that as a challenge to the Secretary of State. If he denies it I shall be very interested. But he knows that that figure is accurate. It has not been denied to the local authorities, but he has an opportunity to deny it this morning. That is only part of the penalty that local authorities, public services and ratepayers will have to pay for the Government's madcap economic policies in 1982-83.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As if that were not enough, we are promised more legislation next year. The ink is hardly dry on the current Bill and the Secretary of State for Scotland is talking about introducing more legislation next year. What will this legislation do? I understand that it will attempt to hamstring local authorities even more by Government-imposed limits on rate increases and mandatory levels of expenditure on local authorities without consultation or negotiation. That is what the Gvernment are about. That is what the Secretary of State for the Environment is about, and that is what the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is following tamely along behind him, is about for 1982-83.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an interesting report in yesterday's 	<i>Financial Times</i> laying this out. Again, the Secretary of State can deny it if the report is not accurate. There is a very interesting bit in the report not just about limiting the rate increases and so on, but about the Government having another wheeze up their sleeve. Desperate and successful as they have been so far, they have another great idea for clobbering local authorities. What they intend to do in this legislation if the report is accurate—and the Secretary of State can deny it if it is not—is to say that before a local authority can impose a rate increase above a certain level, it will have to call a referendum of the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very interesting. I think that kind of idea is attractive. Why not extend it a bit further? Why not have a referendum on the £3 billion tax cuts in the current year that have arisen from the Chancellor's failure, against all the promises of the Tory Party, to raise the income tax allowances? That put a £3 billion imposition on income tax payers in the United Kingdom in the current year. Let us have a referendum about that before the Finance Bill goes through. Let us have a referendum about the petrol price increase, and let us get the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East to lead the " No" campaign in Scotland. Let us have a referendum about the unemployed figure, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
going up to 300,000 today- Let us have a referendum; about the whole miserable policy of the Government. The best referendum that we could have would be an early general election so we could sweep the Tories out of power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Younger)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a slendid self-portrait of the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) this morning. He is deeply shocked that anybody should disagree with local government as to what it wants to spend. He is shattered to find that unrealistic cash limits have been set, to which local government has to work. He is astonished to find any Secretary of State trying to reduce the manpower levels of local government. In general, he is terribly upset about it all. It must be very disturbing to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we must ask ourselves who invented the system of cash limits for local government in Scotland. The answer is that it was the right hon. Gentleman himself. Who was it who placed an abatement on local authorities' spending because he thought they had overspent beyond what he thought was reasonable? It was the right hon. Gentleman himself. Who was it who first had the record of setting what he regarded—and everybody regarded —as an unrealistic cash limit of 5 per cent, in his last year in office? Everybody, including the local authorities, told him that it was wholly unrealistic. It was wholly unrealistic. It turned out to be so. That is what the right hon. Gentleman did. Yet, he is telling us how shocked, amazed and horrified he is that anyone should do such a terrible thing as to set an unrealistic cash limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just in case the right hon. Gentleman feels that I am being unfair to him, he might like to remember what the actual levels of expenditure are. The amount of expenditure which local authorities in Scotland are budgeting to achieve this year—and from which I am trying to get them down—is higher by 2 per cent.—no less—than the figure that the Labour Government were planning. In their last White Paper they were planning for less expenditure than is now being budgeted for. So much for the idea that we are being unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman waxed indignant about a level of spending which he says we should not be getting local government in Scotland down from —a figure which is 2 per cent, higher than the figure he was planning in his White Paper. Are we to believe, from the self-portrait that the right hon. Gentleman has given us this morning, that, if he were Secretary of State and with local government spending as it is now, he would sit meekly back and do nothing about it? Is the right hon. Gentleman telling us that he would do nothing, that there would be no question of any abatement, or any exhortation to local government not to make these extra budgets? Of course not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman proved when he was in office that he had to do this sort of thing, and he would have to do it again if he were in office at the present time. He will perhaps remember, as many
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
of us do, what he said about the subject during his term in office when introducing the rate support grant debate in 1977-78. The right hon. Gentleman said that the February 1976 White Paper on public expenditure stated that the substantial rate of expansion in recent years in local authority manpower and spending could not continue and that any increase in individual services had to be offset by reduced levels of provision in other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman spelt it out not only as regard expenditure, but as regards manpower. So the right hon. Gentleman has put a completely bogus and sham case before the Committee this morning. He knows perfectly well that if he was in my position now he would have no option whatever but to do his best to persuade local authorities to keep within the Government's spending policies. He did it when he was in office and he would have to do it again now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to what the right hon. Gentleman said a few moments ago when he was blowing a triumphant trumpet about the so-called increases which the Government have brought about in expenditure in Scotland, would he care to say whether, as a result of these so-called increases, the situation in Scotland is better now than it was during the time of the previous Labour Government in terms of services, facilities and everything to do with the social, political and economic life of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain of the point that the hon. Gentleman is getting at, but it is perhaps best answered by reminding him that the figure down to which we are trying to get local authority spending is still higher than actual spending in 1977-78. That was a figure that the right hon. Gentleman regarded as perfectly satisfactory and which he is now inviting us to think is quite unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, any Government must take action in this area. I shall try to explain as briefly as I can why we have had to take this action and why we are quite certain that it has to be done, and done in the fairest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When public expenditure is difficult to find, it is difficult for everybody to run services. It would be the easiest thing in the world to run local government if we could spend whatever we wanted. It would be the easiest thing to run central Government if we could spend whatever we wanted. However, that is not the world we live in, and it was not the world the right hon. Gentleman lived in when he was in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that of the total expenditure which the Scottish Office controls, over half—52 per cent.— is paid out in assisting local government. Therefore, any Government must look at this very carefully. If I were not to keep some control on local government spending, I would have to make vastly greater reductions in the other parts of my spending programme, or the Government's economic strategy, or what the country could afford, would be greatly exceeded. No Secretary of State can turn a blind eye to this situation and no Secretary of

	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
State has done so. That is the reality behind what we are discussing this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested in some quarters that local authority expenditure in recent years has generally been satisfactory. It is quite true that in 1978-79 and in the immediately preceding years their current expenditure was broadly in line with rate support grant settlements, but in 1979-80 relevant expenditure was 1 per cent, above the settlement assumption and the cash limits on local authority capital expenditure were exceeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 1980–81 the provisional capital expenditure outturn is more encouraging, but the outturn of relevant expenditure appears to be 4.9 per cent. above the rate support grant settlement for that year. Local authorities were warned of that repeatedly during the year, but they did not do anything effective to deal with it, in spite of the fact that COSLA assured me that that is what they were doing and would do. For the year 1981-82, we face a budgeted excess of about 8-8 per cent, over the RSG settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this background and the constant appeals that have been made for local authorities to trim their spending to what is more reasonable, I have been obliged to take the new powers, which have been put before the House, to ask local authorities to revise their budgets. I very much hope that in the interests of everybody—not least the local authorities themselves—they will now revise their budgets urgently, because the excess which is budgeted for is something like £180 million. This is why some action has to be taken, unless everything is to be exceeded by a very large amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F.Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State must be aware—it will have been drawn to his attention—that only half a dozen authorities throughout Scotland have managed to keep within his guidelines and well over 50, representing all parts of Scotland and all political complexions, have been obliged to go well above his guidelines. Is there not even a seed of doubt in his mind that the judgment of all these different councils about what is necessary to spend in their areas may be right and his solitary judgment of what we need to spend could possibly be wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, guidelines are not the only criterion. I have been urged by COSLA not to regard guidelines as being the only criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, someone has to decide what the national economy can afford. It would be the easiest job in the world if we could ignore that. The hon. Gentleman and I could agree on everything we ever wanted to do, if that were the case. I think that he is a spokesman for the Opposition on the Finance Bill. Whether he likes it or not, if he were ever translated into the position of doing that job in Government, he would have to tell his right hon. and hon. Friends that an excess of this sort could not possibly be tolerated. Of course he would do that. But he never will do it, because he will never be in the position and will never have the chance to do it. He had better watch it, because, if he
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
ever is in that position, he will have to do it. He will do it, I can assure him, if he ever gets in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the year we have just completed we probably have an excess of overspend of about £83 million. That will also have to be acted upon. This is why I have had to ask for revised budgets and why I intend to reduce the rate support grant payable this year by £100 million—not as much as the £180 million that the budgeting is showing. However, if the outturn figures for the year just ended show an excess of £83 million, I shall have to reduce the rate support grant otherwise payable in respect of that year by £60 million under powers which have been available to all Governments since 1966. They were put through by a Labour Government in that year and therefore presumably approved by them. I think the right hon. Member for Craighton was a member of that Government, so he would no doubt approve of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned manpower and I want to say something about that. Ever since I came into office. I have been exhorting local authorities to start reducing their manpower levels. Despite this, by September 1980 numbers were about 8,000 more than when we came into office and 15,000 more than there had been two years before that. I am glad to say that at last the message seems to be getting through, although somewhat late in the day, and a downward trend is now emerging. Figures fell by about 2,000, or 0.8 per cent., in the quarter from September to December last and figures to be published later this week will show a further similar fall in the first quarter of 1981. I very much hope that the downward trend will continue. Yet, I must emphasise that, even with these recent reductions, the present manning levels are less than half of 1 per cent. below what they were a year ago. Over the same period, local authority numbers in England fell by 40,000, or 2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that this downward trend in Scotland will accelerate and that local authorities will show, albeit belatedly, the same response as they showed to the Labour Government and the right hon. Gentleman when local authorities under his persuasion succeeded in reducing their numbers by 11,000 over the 18 months from June 197 to December 1977. Again, it was the right hon. Gentleman who was so indigant about the idea that any Government should persuade local government to reduce its numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State not find it somewhat ironic that he and his colleagues in the Government weep crocodile tears every day about the level of unemployment, yet what he is advocating now is the creation of additional unemployment, throwing more and more people out of work in Scotland when there are almost 300,000 out of work already? How on earth could he morally defend that position at a time when his colleagues are pretending that they have sympathy for those who are presently in the dole queues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not recall the hon. Gentleman berating his right hon. Friend in 1977 for deliberately reducing local authority numbers by 11,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall him doing that. Perhaps he did. Perhaps he did behind the scenes. I do not know, but I do not recall him doing that. In any event, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not disagree with me that the cost of paying for the extra people employed in local government falls directly and absolutely upon the ratepayers and upon the businesses which are trying to employ the people who are unemployed. That is where the money comes from. The hon. Gentleman must realise that if he tried to expand these numbers in order to mop up unemployment by that means, he would be creating far more unemployment by other means among the people who would have to pay for it. The hon. Gentleman has not got that straight. I hope he will get it straight before he gets the chance to take any decisions of this sort. He will not get any further until he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this background it is quite obvious that it is simply not an option for the Government to sit back and do nothing. If the Government tried to do so, they would not only upset the entire ability of the country to pay for the services which are being expanded at this difficult time, but they would let down the ratepayers who are having an extremely difficult time in affording the rate increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned the £100 million penalty a few minutes ago. He seems to have left that. Is he going to answer my question? Is the £100 million a fixed figure? If the authorities respond, will it be reduced? If so, how will it be reduced? Will there be a general claw-back? These figures are absolutely crucial to this debate, yet he seems to have passed all this by. We want answers to these questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not passed all this by. I am just coming to it. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman will be disappointed. It is against this background that I have to consider the measures set out in the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1981. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that the provisions of that Act erode local democracy. The ability to reduce the grant to authorities which incur excessive and unreasonable expenditure has existed since 1929. My new power enables me to reduce the grant payable to local authorities which are planning to incur excessive and unreasonable expenditure. The new procedure preserves all the safeguards that were put into the 1966 Act, which were approved by the Labour Party. I believe that there is wide support for the opportunity that this affords for the ratepayer to see that someone is doing something to prevent him or her having to meet increasingly excessive demands for services which are expanded at a time of great national difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already notified seven authorities—the right hon. Gentleman mentioned them—of my intention to
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
reduce their rate support grant, and I await with great interest their representations in reply. I understand from what has been said in various quarters that they intend to make a response to my request. I shall look at what they have to say very carefully and with an absolutely open mind. The occasion to deal with these seven individual cases will arise if and when, after considering their representations, I lay before the House any reports for the approval of the House. For the time being, I want to make it quite clear that the consultation process is genuine. I hope that, if they have strong arguments to put, they will put them. They will certainly be listened to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is true that, as the right hon. Member for Craigton said, by one or other of these means we have to achieve the reduction in expenditure which I have outlined. The first way in which I hope we shall achieve most of it is by the revision of budgets for which I have asked, which is to be done by the end of July, and which I hope all authorities are now busily engaged upon. If we can get some of the reduction in that way, it will help what has to be got by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the selective powers under the new Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act. There again, if a successful case is put by any of these seven authorities, or by any other authorities which later may be written to in the same way, there can of course be a reduction in the amount of grant that is taken away from such authorities. That is what the consultation process is all about. I have made that clear previously. I hope that will be repeated and made clear to all concerned. This is not an immutable figure. It is open to representation. It is the case that, if some of these amounts are recovered in that way, less will have to be recovered by means of a general abatement across the board from which the balance might have to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three ways in which local authorities in Scotland can avoid the necessity for further penal measures of any kind. The first is by revising their budgets. That is much the best method, if they can do it. The second is by the selective measures which I have suggested on certain authorities producing reductions which will contribute towards the whole. The third is by a general abatement across the board which may be necessary for the balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Alteram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm, in answer to some of the suggestions that have been made that he is in some way trying to claw back this money for the Government, that in the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1981 there is provision for the local authorities to make these reductions by reducing the rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes indeed. My hon. Friend is right. If a local authority—one of the seven, or any other for that matter—does have a direct abatement selectively applied to it, it will have the option of allowing the money to remain, to pay it back to the Government or to return it to its own ratepayers in the form of a rates reduction. The key to what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
we are trying to achieve here is a reduction of general expenditure so that it comes within what the country can afford. We are also trying to do something belatedly to save some of the ratepayers who are facing excessive rate increases which they cannot possibly afford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman take the opportunity to explain to those local authorities which may be considering handing back some of this money to the ratepayers who will pay for the actual cost of sending out the new rate demands that would arise? Tayside region says that if there were any decision by Dundee district council to reduce the rates and it had to issue a new rate demand, the cost to the regional council sending out new rates demands would be pushed back on the district council. That is hardly an incentive to consider that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is some cost, but it is very small relative to the sum concerned. In any case, I am quite confident that the ratepayers, who would enjoy such a great reduction, would be glad to carry any cost involved if they could see some chance of having such a reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least one thing is clear. There is nothing intrinsically new in the central Government controlling or trying to control the expenditure of local authorities in conformity with general Government policy. It has been the policy of successive Governments—there is nothing new in it—and the froth and indignation that the right hon. Gentleman tried to whip up this morning are wholly bogus and spurious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maelennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to what the Secretary of State said about there being nothing new in principle about the central Government seeking to control local government expenditure. Does he not think that the record of failure of control of this kind ought to lead to a complete reassessment of local authority financing? Is he in fact ruling out in his consultation paper the possibility of offering local government much greater financial responsibility— for example, by making open to it, as the Layfield committee recommended, the possibility of a local income tax? If local authorities are not, in his view, behaving responsibly, might he not improve the situation by leaving it to the electors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I think that I heard most of it. He is quite right that this is highlighting the unsatisfactory nature of the rating system. The rating system has always been unsatisfactory in the view of many of us, but the strain that is being put on it at the moment is highlighting its unsatisfactory nature even more. That is why my right hon Friends and I have announced that we intend to publish a consultative paper in the autumn. Some of the suggestions which I think the hon. Gentleman was making will probably be included, and it will certainly be relevant to comment upon it at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope it is clear why I am having to take this action. Planned expenditure is much higher than the
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
economy can afford. The right hon. Member for Craigton knows that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the average increase in rates by Scottish authorities in 1981-82 was no less than 35 per cent. Lest anyone should think that that is inevitable because of the Government's policies—that is what the right hon. Gentleman implied—it is twice the rate of increase south of the border, where rather tougher policies have been employed. That is the total answer to the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion that it is the way in which the Scottish local authorities have been treated that has caused this difficult. That is not the case. He knows that it is not the case and the facts make it clear that it is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate increases that make up this 35 per cent., which itself is bad enough, conceal other positively outrageous increases, such as the increase of 50 per cent, imposed on ratepayers by Lothian regional council and increases of 150 per cent, by Dundee district council, to take just two examples. By any standard those increases are insupportable for many who will have to pay them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State for Scotland has clearly indicated the three actions that a local authority could take if it wished to do his bidding. But if it exercises a democratic right not to do his bidding, what will happen? He has no power to step in and appoint a commissioner. What will happen to the ratepayers and their services? What will happen to the council and the councillors? The whole of Scotland wants to know. Instead of dodging the issue, will he tell us exactly what will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an issue not only I but hon. Gentlemen opposite have to face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is a believer in a proper system of constitutional government. He knows perfectly well that there is a place for local authority and a place for central authority. He knows perfectly well that all Governments have to try to put through their own economic policies and have to work the system as it stands with the local authorities concerned. The hon. Gentleman's question implies that the local authorities, when this Government are in power, should be entitled to run their own show, as if there were no economic policy, to let rate increases hit the roof and to ignore any Government guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. That is what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. What he has to answer—perhaps he has not answered it even to himself—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does he accept that local authorities in Scotland have to work within the general ambit of the economic policy of the Government of the day? If it displeases them, they have every

	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
right to say so and to do what they can about it. But they certainly are not right—nor were they right under the Labour Government—to upset the entire economic policy of the Government of the day. They have to work within it. They always have, and I hope that he will support them in doing so in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that he has a responsibility for allocating the rate support grant, which he has done, and that the local authorities have a responsibility for determining their levels of rates? Does he agree that he is interfering with their right to decide their rate levels? By interfering with the rights of local authorities, he is threatening them. They may go bankrupt as a result of his deliberate action. If so, what will happen? The situation is serious. The right hon. Gentleman and the local authorities are set on a collision course. Will he tell the people of Scotland what the result will be if they fail to bow to his dictation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they were to go bankrupt, not only would they be extremely foolish and irresponsible, but it would be by their own hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly what the hon. Gentleman described. If any local authority decides to go bankrupt, it will be in the same position as anyone else who goes bankrupt. It will go bankrupt. That is what will happen. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away from that. I do not know what he thinks would happen—whether he thinks a good fairy would come down from the sky and put it right or something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I am trying to answer the hon. Gentleman's question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should allow me to finish answering his question. He asked what would happen if local authorities were allowed to strike their own rate and all the rest of it. I can tell him what would happen. We could no doubt avoid many of these troubles if we allowed local authorities to spend whatever they liked. If we allowed them to put on any rate increases, whatever they liked, that would be perfectly easy to do, but no one has ever done that. The right hon. Member for Craigton did not do that, and I am sure that he will not do that if he is ever in this position again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

policy makes it difficult for them to do all they want to do. Of course they have that right. But what they do not have the right to do, and never have had the right to do, is to soak their own ratepayers and to overspend beyond Government guidelines and the advice of central Government. They have never had that right. They do not have it now, and they never have had it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation has changed. Will the Secretary of State answer the question? If he penalises Lothian region, for example, to the extent of £53 million and it carries on spending, he has prohibited it from borrowing to cover that. What happens when the money runs out? Does it close the schools if it cannot pay the teachers' wages? What is going to happen at that stage? Presumably the Secretary of State did not put through the legislation without taking that possibility into account. What is going to happen? Is he simply going to stand back and allow that to happen? Will he just answer that question " Yes " or " No "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority were to do that, it would be grossly irresponsible. I do not know if the right hon. Gentleman disagrees with me—perhaps he does not—but that would be a grossly irresponsible thing to do. I think he will be fair enough to agree with me that, just like he did, I have the right to say to local authorities what I think they ought to be spending. Does he or does he not agree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority, in his terms, is grossly irresponsible enough to do that, what is the Secretary of State going to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.

If any local authority were so foolish as to do that, then it would be failing in its duty—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course it would. It would be grossly irresponsible. This could happen at any time, not necessarily because of this or any other case at all. The right hon- Gentleman knows perfectly well that that is the case. I do not know what point he is trying to make at the moment, but it does not make any sense to anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes a good deal of sense to the people in Lothian Region. The Secretary of State keeps going round in circles. The local authority has a statutory responsibility. It is supposed to educate children, but it cannot do that if it has run out of money to pay the teachers' salaries. What happens? Do the schools close down? Do the social work departments close down? Does the authority stop maintaining the roads? The Secretary of State has put local government into a strait-jacket. When the straitjacket is tightened round it and services begin to close down, what does the Secretary of State propose to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman has studied what happens when a local authority fails to carry out its statutory obligations. That is the situation that the right hon. Gentleman

	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
is trying to spell out. This would be more reasonable if I were asking the local authorities to get back to a level of spending which was impossible to achieve. But he knows quite well that that is not the case. I very much hope that the right hon-Gentleman is not, in what he has been saying this morning, trying to encourage local authorities to be irresponsible in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I will in a moment. I hope the right hon. Gentleman is not trying to encourage local authorities to behave irresponsibly in this way, because he knows perfectly well that, whether one likes it or not—and I accept that he does not—it is perfectly legitimate for the central Government to give guidelines to local authorities and to ask them to remain within them. He must agree that that is so. If he does not, he is not being true to himself in the past, or to anyone else for that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am asking the Secretary of State is to consider that for the first time, because of this Government's legislation, it is possible for local government in Scotland to break down completely in particular authorities. Local authorities will run out of money and they have no power, except by the consent of the Secretary of State, to borrow money to keep the services going. Does he seriously ask us to believe that in that situation—talking about responsibility and irresponsibility—he will allow schools to close in Lothian Region? Is that what he intends? If that is not the intention of the legislation, what is he doing? He is putting provisions in that prevent local authorities from borrowing, so they will run out of money. He has produced that result; he must know how he intends to deal with it. Why does he not answer the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to answer the question. The right hon. Gentleman is totally ignoring the way that is perfectly open to the local authority to right matters, which is by reducing its spending. As far as borrowing is concerned, as the right hon. Gentleman will remember, the new Act allows the local authority that cannot borrow to replace this money with the consent of the Secretary of State.

At a time when we have over 	<i>2\</i> million unemployed in this country, when we have mass unemployment in Scotland, where the majority of school leavers have no hope of finding work this summer, he can gloat about the destruction of jobs. This Government were elected on a policy which said that if they cut taxes it would release productive energy and create new industries

and new jobs. That policy has demonstrably failed; the only alternative is a massive programme of public spending and investment to avert the spiral of decline which is affecting the economy of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are proud of the level of service in the Lothian region. As someone whose family uses these services regularly, I can say that we derive great benefit as a whole community from the standard of service. We are proud that the old people of Edinburgh can travel free on the Lothian region buses, a great facility which the Under-Secretary of State singled out for criticism in the debate last week. We are proud of our standard of educational provision, which was brought out in 	<i>The Sunday Standard</i> survey of education the Sunday before last. I am proud of the level of social services, especially the home help service for our old people. We are in no way apologetic in Lothian region for what is being achieved by that Labour group. The £5-75 per week which the average ratepayer spends for these services is very good value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important thing I want to do this morning, however, in the limited time available, is to bring home to Ministers that they really will have to accept the enormity of what they seek to enforce on the Lothian region. When I challenged the Secretary of State at Scottish Question Time last Wednesday and when I raised it again last Thursday with the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), it was quite clear that either they are ignorant of the facts or refuse to spell out the actual position in relation to a cut of £53 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said, in response to my intervention,
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would advise the hon. Gentleman to speak not to his Labour colleagues, but to the officials of Lothian region."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that, if I did so, I should be in no doubt that
	<br><blockquote><p>"that region, if it had the will, could make cuts runnning into many millions of pounds with minimal redundancies and minimal effect on the vital services to the community. The vast majority of the people of the Lothian region have come to a similar conclusion."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18 June 1981; c. 11.]</p></blockquote>
I will come to the latter point about the views of the people of the region later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary that Lothian regional council officials have prepared a detailed statement of what the cut would mean. On the basis of an objective pro rata cut across the board, the effect would be absolutely devastating. It could only be done by making thousands of public service workers redundant in the Lothian region this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take education, the biggest spender and the most important service. I will quote from the official document, since the Under-Secretary was anxious that we should know the position of officials.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In terms of EDUCATION, this represents a pro rata share of the budget of 15·5% or, in real terms £27½ million. To put it in perspective, this sum equals the TOTAL Education budget for Dumfries and Galloway.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>However, bearing in mind that loan charges amount to some £19 million of the Education budget, to achieve the target of £27½ million means finding 17% from the rest of the service"</p></blockquote>
I will not spell out all the details, but it goes on to explain how these cuts could be made across the board.
	<br><blockquote><p>" Possibly £8 million could be found under non-staffing headings (i.e. increased school meals charges etc.) and possibly a further £2 million from non-filling of vacancies."</p></blockquote>
Let us be quite clear. We are not talking about loading all the money onto redundancies—on the contrary, the council is increasing charges where it can.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In terms of jobs this would mean:</p></blockquote>
	<table class='table table-striped'>
	<tr>
	<td>Primary</td>
	<td>— 1,700 post</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Secondary</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Further Education</td>

	<tr>
	<td>non-filling of vacancies</td>
	<td>— 950 non-teaching posts</td>

	<tr>
	<td>360 teaching post</td>

</table>
	<br><blockquote><p>As the budget had already made allowance for a reduction of 400 posts due to falling school rolls,"—</p></blockquote>
hon. Members should ponder that when we hear these allegations of profligacy on the part of the Lothian region—
	<br><blockquote><p>" this would imply a reduction in the Education establishment alone of some 3,500."</p></blockquote>
The Government want to destroy 3,500 jobs in our education service in the Lothian region. The document goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>" There is no need to spell out the consequential effects on service provision, class sizes etc.".</p></blockquote>
That is a document produced by the officials of Lothian regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Will he confirm that the figures that he has just given—which, indeed, were published in the press as the figures of the Lothian Labour group— demonstrate that it is possible for Lothian region, without a single redundancy, to make savings of £10 million in its education budget alone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—if the council is prepared to slash the level of provision. If it is prepared massively to increase school meal charges; if it is prepared to cut—and that is what it means, actually to halt—all purchases of equipment for schools— and I am glad the hon. Gentleman is nodding. It is true that one can make some savings without laying off workers. But even with the most extreme savings of that nature, there is no alternative to paying off thousands—3,500 jobs in education alone—so the Government cannot continue to bury their head in the sand. The least they can do is openly to admit the implications of that £53 million cut for jobs and services in the Lothian region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Lang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sceptical of such assertions. Of course I accept that businesses do not like
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
to pay more rates. Of course I accept that there must be a small impact across the economy as a whole. But every study has shown that the number of businesses going bankrupt and the number of workers being paid off are just as high in some of the authorities that are cutting services as in those that are trying to maintain a level of service. Public expenditure is much more cost effective in terms of creating employment than are tax cuts, because people use tax cuts to buy Japanese recorders and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the level of educational provision is clearly controversial between the two sides of the Committee, would my hon. Friend have regard to the section supplied by the official responsible for water supply in the same document from which he quoted, in which that official states that a pro rata cut in his budget will mean that he will be unable to maintain proper standards of fresh water provision, resulting in significant health hazards to the public? Does my hon. Friend accept that that ought to be a consequence of the Government's policy towards Lothian region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that would be the effect of a pro rata cut across the board, and the only way to avoid that would be to make even more savage cuts in the educational service or in the transport service. May I just say to the Under-Secretary that some of his own colleagues in local government in Lothian have been rather more frank and forthcoming about these matters. May I quote an example—and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for drawing my attention to some of the quotes in the East Lothian papers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Councillor Norman Hall (Conservative, Traprain), predieted that the struggle over the rates was going to become "very bitter ".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amount the Secretary of State is asking to be cut is patently impossible"."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to explain why that is impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the cuts that the Government are trying to enforce on East Lothian district council— which also covers part of the Edinburgh, East constituency—are also impossible. I quote from the 	<i>East Lothian Courier</i> of 19 June:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The leader of the Conservative group on East Lothian District Council said yesterday it would be ' impossible' for the local authority to meet the threatened £1-35 million rate support grant cut in the current year."</p></blockquote>
The proposed cut in East Lothian district council is massive. It is well over half the total rate support grant and is clearly preposterous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government are fully aware of what they are entering into here. They are asking us, as the Labour movement in Lothian region, to make cuts in services and to make people redundant on a scale which is unacceptable. We will resist that with all the power we can muster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) was right to highlight the attack that this represents on local democracy. It is not fully understood in Lothian region, even by the teachers whose jobs are at stake, that when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
Lothian regional council fixed its rate at the beginning of this financial year, the public expenditure level that it fixed had no effect on the level of central Government support for Lothian regional services. That support consists of a needs element, which is not affected by it, and a resources element, under which we get nothing in the Lothian region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland has already discriminated against us. We believe that the recasting of the distribution of the resources element was partly motivated by the desire to deprive the regional council of money. We get nothing under the resources element. The Government are penalising our elected regional council for choosing to spend some of its own money, which it raises from its own electors, independently of central Government money, to try to provide a decent level of service in the Lothian region. I remind the Under-Secretary of his remark, which I quoted earlier:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The vast majority of the people of the Lothian region have come to a similar conclusion."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18 June 1981; c. 11.]</p></blockquote>
Let them come to that conclusion. We shall have an election in less than a year. We are spending all our own money. A local paper has highlighted the effects of the rate increases regularly and consistently, every week—indeed, almost every day. Let us have a real democratic election on it. But to interfere in this way is wholly provocative. It represents a wanton and blatant attack on the rights of democratically elected local councillors to provide an adequate level of service in their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help feeling that the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) is a sad one for the ratepayers of Lothian region and Edinburgh in particular. I was surprised by the vehemence of his claim that they would resist the Government's strictures with all the power that they could muster. In his remarks on the Floor of the House during the Report stage of the Local Government (Scotland) Bill—he can deny or confirm this now— he certainly gave the impression that he hoped that, if the Lothian region were faced with this choice, it would take the route that would achieve a reduction in the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the hon. Gentleman said today, it seems he has departed from that sensible position, and it is sad for those of us who have at heart the interests of Lothian and Edinburgh in particular that he seems to be encouraging—as did his right hon. Friend—the regional council to take steps which will hurt everybody in that region.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, I hope that I shall be able to answer that question during my speech, but I do not wish to delay the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) was right in a way which perhaps he did not appreciate when he started by saying that local government finance was in a state of crisis. In many ways we have reached a watershed in terms of local government financing, and severe lessons are having to be learnt as a result. His view of the crisis is different from mine, but I believe that we are learning from the crisis that the system of local government financing is outdated and in many ways unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of financing—the rate support grant plus the rates—basically depends upon co-operation and responsibility from local authorities. If that is lacking or if it is deliberately destroyed for political reasons, the balance between them cannot last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National Governments are accountable to the taxpayers for the money that they give to local authorities in rate support grants. Unfortunately, local authorities are too often not accountable, because those who pay the full rates, or nearly the full rates, are a minority of the electors and can be disregarded by local authorities without any electoral consequences. In the end, all they can do is to bear the brunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It defies belief to accept the right hon. Gentleman's argument that the Government should cough up whenever local government wants to increase its spending—the blank cheque philosophy. Fair enough, there are statutory obligations that local government is bound to fulfil, and national Governments must take them into account in setting the level of rate support grant, but, beyond that, there must be restraint and common sense, and local authorities should not be able to turn to the ratepayers for increased rates year after year as an alternative to trying to make their services and administration more efficient and less expensive. In the end, they will be robbing Peter to pay Paul.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East may say, that has a devastating effect on jobs. Businesses go to places where the rate burden is less. Local authorities are operating the law of diminishing returns by increasing rates by the amount that they were increased in Lothian region this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian region is a central case in point. I have been highly critical of the regional authority in the past, but I have always hoped that it would eventually come off its political high horse and come to terms with economic realities. It is being given the chance under the Local Government (Scotland) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981, to make amends for the mistake it made in February and to reduce the swingeing and disastrous rate increase imposed at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman not agree that he is introducing Aunt Sallys into the debate by telling us that he is dissatisfied with the structure of local government in
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
Scotland, when it was his party which, against opposition, pushed through the whole reorganisation of local government? We are confronted with massive problems of finance and the hon. Gentleman says that everything is not going so well, but his party was responsible for the reorganised structure of local government in Scotland. It is monstrous to introduce such Aunt Sallys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not introduced that. I hope that when we debate the Stodart report I will have the chance to introduce such topics. The hon. Gentleman can repeat that intervention then and it might have more justification. So far I have not spoken about the structure. I have talked about the form of financing which, as I understand it, is what the debate is about. I intend to limit my remarks to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, even at this late hour, the Lothian region will understand the consequences of its continuing intransigence and will come to the table and talk to the Secretary of State about where reductions can and should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not encouraged by the signs, and even less encouraged by the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East. There is every indication that the council is running a propaganda battle in which it claims that every cut will hit direct services and in some cases—the hon. Gentleman almost said this— will destroy them. The Council is adopting the cynical argument which says, " If we are to be asked to cut, let us not look for areas of waste or areas where we can make these cuts responsibly. Let us hit the most vulnerable sections of society and then say that it is all the Government's fault." That is how they hope to win the election next year. I do not believe that the people of Lothian region will accept that argument. They have eyes and ears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East's argument about the effect of the cuts is right, he is effectively arguing that the Lothian region is 100 per cent, efficient and cost-efficient, that there is no waste, no duplication, and no employees who are not required. He only has to look at the facts, and I shall use the example of education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way any more, I have given way enough. I have given way twice and that is enough. I want briefly to look at education —the hon. Gentleman mentioned education—and remind the Committee of one or two matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eduction budget for this year is about £172 million, an increase of £39 million over last year What has been happening in Lothian region during that time? Over the past two years there has been a decrease of 7,315 pupils and an increase of 1,127 staff. Conservative Members find that unjustifiable, particularly as many of the increases were in no-teaching staff. At a time of falling school rolls, I find that difficult to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About two weeks ago, I read in the 	<i>Edinburgh Evening News</i> that another 70 non-teaching staff had been taken on by the Lothian region at a cost of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
£350,000 a year, at a time when reductions are being looked for. Perhaps the Secretary of State had better put that into his manpower lists. These are facts which people in Edinburgh know about and they know that there are many areas in the education budget where cuts can be made without effectively hitting or destroying the services of education provided to children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that these are facts, but the figure he has given of increased non-teaching posts is not a fact unless we know what those posts are. Is he suggesting that education exists only with the classroom teacher? Are there not other things attached to it? Who are these people? They may be essential. The hon. Gentleman must not dismiss figures in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman attended the debates on the local government Bill he would have heard a breakdown of the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave them and I will repeat merely one. Nearly as many non-teaching staff as teachers were appointed last year. There is no system or business in this country where one non-teaching administrator is needed for one teacher and even educationalists like the hon. Gentleman must be able to appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way. I have given way on three times; I will not give way again. There are vast areas of surplus in all areas of Lothian region—which can be cut before the essentials are threatened and if the regional council really cares for those it was elected to serve its primary duty must be to achieve cost effectiveness, just as any business has to achieve it for the shareholders who pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government and its financing are on trial in Lothian. Intransigence holds more threats for the system of local government than for our national Government and I plead with the Lothian regional councillors to see sense before it is too late. I would be interested to know whether that same plea is to be made by the right hon. Member for Craigton whose position of responsibility within his party would demand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never felt the system of local government finance to be satisfactory, for the reasons I have already stated. Lothian highlights that, because no system can be satisfactory when it simply milks the ratepayers dry and uses them as a nut in a nutcracker in a political argument with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local Government provision on finance and expenditure has been helped by the Local Government (Scotland) Act, but it is helping only in these particular circumstances, and I say to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that it is no substitute for reform of the system. I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement that will have a consultative paper soon on local government finance. We must
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
find a way in which the burden of local government financing is more fairly and more accountably shared and which is based on the ability to pay rather than simply upon bricks and mortar. I am pleased to see that the Social Democratic Party has a representative in the Committee who seems to follow me on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get away from the blank cheque mentality, away from the necessity of Government intervention, by reforming the system, away from the milking of the minority of ratepayers that is taking place at the moment. Local democracy—like all democracy—depends on accountability and acceptability. Unless we move soon we shall have neither, and local government as a useful stratum of democratic administration in this country will have failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dick Douglas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must return to the very pertinent issue that was raised with the Secretary of State by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) I think the Committee must have answer to that issue this morning. Not only should the Committee have answer, so also should the people of Scotland including the people running the local authorities there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, if he uses the powers in this Act, would drive the local authorities whom he considered in default into a corner. If they do not conform to his strictures what will he do? Local authority finance at the end of the day—the guarantee that people think they are getting when they invest in a local authority—is tantamount to a Government guarantee. Therefore at the end of the day—and perhaps the Under-Secretary might apply his legal mind to this—the Government have to pick up the tab. Is the Under-Secretary saying " No "? I will give way if he wishes. The Government have to pick up that tab. Take the analogy of New York. When New York, for other reasons, defaulted the United States Government had to come in and assist in picking up the tab.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing that it was on the basis of reductions; the Under-Secretary is giving me my point. In finality, this is tantamount to a Government guarantee and no Government could let a local authority go into bankruptcy. If right hon. and hon.

I will now turn to the issues that confront us. My right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton said that local government finance is in a state of chaos. I accept that, but I think we have to go further than we have gone this morning. We naturally have to take cognisance of the issues of the day,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
but we have to go further and look at the reasons for the present situation, because central government imposes on local government certain financial spending responsibilities because of what we do in this House. Much of local authority expenditure is preordained by us, and the local authorities have to carry out the functions. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) indicated that we ought to have a new and more bouyant system of local authority finance. Layfield reported on this in, I think, 1976 and what the Government promise us now is another consultative document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not here necessarily to defend the Labour Government, nor will I defend the changes in local authorities that in some cases we supported. If we had carried out the wishes of the Government of the day my area would have been divided, and what a division. We might have been in Tayside region and in Lothian region. God help Fife in those circumstances. Were we not lucky in Fife that we did not take the strictures imposed on us by some people in my party, because—and I want the Secretary of State to turn his attention to this— in Scotland we have no adequate auditing function. We look at a mere regularity audit. There is no efficiency audit. There is no value for money audit. When local authorities therefore say, " We are providing the best service", the Secretary of State cannot contradict them, cannot say that here is a local authority in essence that is more cost-effective in education or in housing than another local authority. We have no machinery to do that. But if we are looking at the reform of local government finance, we have to go back to look at the structure of local authorities themselves. We have produced, as Layfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a varietly of two-tier organisations with diverse and overlapping responsibilities which present serious obstacles to the creation of a financial system providing clear accountability."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making the point which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) denied.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it was pushed through by the Government of the day. But, with respect to my hon. Friend, I cannot say that we are absolved from the responsibility of agreeing to a ridiculous situation in Scotland where half the population is pushed into one region like Strathclyde. I know the amendments that we moved. I was there at the time. But, as parties collectively, we were bemused by the estuarial argument and that meant that we got up the creek in relation to planners. We were making a structure without laying the financial foundation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bothwell)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. Friend should, as it were, give any indication that local government reform went through the House with the acquiescence of the Labour side. The Tories put it through when they were
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
the Government. Furthermore, the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Secretary of State for Scotland did not agree with the then Secretary of State for Scotland but he did not have the courage to align himself with those of us who put forward a different concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should forget that intervention. I think that we should now move on to the subject under debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Gourlay, but the subject under debate is, of course, local authority finance. I do not think that we can talk about finance without talking about the structure. Therefore I am arguing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The structure does not come within the Estimates which are being discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am suggesting, Mr. Gourlay, that if we are looking at the rates and the rate support grant, we are looking at a source of revenue. Therefore we have to plead with the Secretary of State at this juncture to look at a more buoyant source of revenue. There is really no need to have consultative documents at this juncture. Layfield is a massive report which outlines quite clearly the possibility, indeed the probability, of having a local income tax. I suggest that we do not need to wait for England and Wales to catch up. It is easier to do it in Scotland because we are computerised, but I recognise that we could not do it solely for Scotland without a commitment that England and Wales would follow. We need a clearer and more buoyant source of local authority finance. Rates are a bad tax. No Socialist can argue that we should finance local government on the basis of such a regressive, stupid and antediluvian tax. Therefore we ought to be committed quite clearly to raising local authority finance and revenue from a more buoyant and equitable form of direct taxation. I hope that when we have further debates on this issue we shall get off this collision course because such a tax makes the people who provide the service at the end of the day much more accountable to the electorate and gets away from the barnstorming that we have had today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about accountability. I have considerable sympathy with his remarks. An approach based on an efficiency audit would be of considerable benefit. It would be of the greatest benefit to local government if all collectors were also making a contribution to the costs of their local authorities. One of the reasons why a few local authorities are going overboard on expenditure is that they know very well that the burden of their excessive expenditure, harmful as it is to the nation as a whole, is falling on a relatively small number of shoulders and not on the main body of those who elected them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the right hon. Gentleman who opened the debate failed to take credit for what must have been the only really notable success of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
his period as Secretary of State for Scotland. In the 18 months between mid-1976 and the end of 1977, the staffing of local authorities in Scotland dropped by 12,000. That was the cut which the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) managed to achieve in 18 months with local authorities in that short period. It is surprising to hear him say today that central Government should have no say in the overall expenditure of local authorities, when he has a background record of that kind. He ought to glance at the Scottish joint manpower watch survey, which clearly brings out the way in which these figures developed. It would be legitimate, with his record under the Labour Government of slashing local authority staffing by 12,000 in 18 months, for him to criticise my right hon. Friend for the fact that since this Government came to power local authority staffing has increased by 6,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that a large part of that increase is due to the fact that the police force has generally been brought up to strength, that we have recruited more maths and science teachers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman hazard a guess as to why the former Secretary of State for Scotland was so successful without having statutory powers to clobber local authorities on their heads, and why the present Secretary of State will be totally unsuccessful with his power of coercion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. It is the nub of the matter. The big difference between these two Governments, as represented by the two right hon. Gentlemen, is that the right hon. Member for Craigton did what he did because the IMF and his right hon. Friend, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, made him. There was no option, because the country was going bust. But the reason he was so successful was that all local authorities—no, most local authorities, because there were a few bolshie Labour ones even then—gave him substantial co-operation in the national interest in achieving those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference on this occasion is that a relatively small number of local authorities have quite significantly, and with malice aforethought, decided to go right overboard and increase their expenditure as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we should have a little silence to allow the Chair to hear what the debate is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contrast overall is that where there are Labour district councils there has been an average increase of 40 per cent, in rates. On other district councils there has been an average increase of 14 per cent, in rates. If this shows nothing else, it shows that the determination of the level of rates has less to do with the intervention of Her Majesty's Government and more to do with the political complexion of the authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
It is a truly remarkable contrast to look at the seven Labour local authorities which head the list if high spenders, ranging from a 55 per cent, increase by Kirkcaldy district council up to a 150 per cent, increase by Dundee district council. On the other hand, of the seven Conservative local authorities, the lowest is North-East Fife with no increase in rates—it shares that distinction with Berwickshire —and the highest is Bearsden with a 20 per cent, increase. So, the highest Conservative-controlled local authority has had less than half the increase of the seventh on the list of Labour local authorities. That is a very remarkable contrast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman not said that public expenditure is necessary in this country? Does he not understand that local government money is necessary to pay for services, which are essential to working people, particularly young and old, disabled and handicapped? Of course, the Conservative Party is not concerned with those people. It is more concerned with landowners and bankers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the hon. Gentleman has shown that his understanding of the affairs of Afghanistan is considerably wider than the affairs of Scotland. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am seeking to answer the point made by the hon. Gentleman. The point is that the amount of money provided through the rate support grant for local government expenditure this year in real terms is higher than it was in 1977–78 under the Labour Government. If they were not providing adequate services for the people of Scotland, that is for him to argue with his right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the difference between this Government and the Labour Government is that the Labour Government did not face either a Shadow Secretary of State or a combined Opposition opposing plans for savings? In fact, they had constructive opposition to bring about the savings that were made possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. There are many remarkable contrasts between the responsibility of the two main parties, and not the least of the contrasts is seen by looking across from one end of the Tay bridge to the other. The North-East Fife authority has no increase in the rates this year. But, looking across the Tay bridge, we have Dundee with a 150 per cent, increase in the rates this year. It is at this point that I urge my right hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grange mouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way. I want to make this point to my right hon. Friend arising out of this debate. The fact of the matter is that a few local authorities, by really going over the top on major expenditure, are in effect stealing from other local authorities out of the total that is available in the public purse. I expect my right hon. Friend to make sure that those local authorities which have had a consistent record of reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
care for their own expenditure do not suffer at the hands of the big spenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point I would like to come back briefly to the question of accountability. Under the present system of raising local authority finance—that part of it which is found by local ratepayers—only £1 out of every £3 spent by local authorities is raised on rates. That is quite a small proportion. It hurts the ratepayer a lot, but it is the smallest portion of total local government expenditure. It is a major injustice in that that burden falls on a few ratepayers, not on all the electors. There is representation without taxation, and until that is cured we will continue to have a problem of local authorities not being as responsible as they would be if all electors were paying on the basis of local taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to seeing the consultative document promised by my right hon. Friend in the autumn. There has to be substantial reform of the rating system. We have to remove domestic rates and for my choice I would ask my right hon. Friend to direct his attention particularly to a poll tax. I know there are difficulties about that. There are problems with all the alternatives to the rating system. The one thing which the rates system has going for it is that it is quite clear who is due to pay and to which local authority—the one in whose area the ratepayer lives. No other tax basis provides that opportunity. I hope that, in trying to bring greater sense and responsibility to local authorities, my right hon. Friend will get a good hearing now in the present local authorities for his major efforts to bend over backwards to be reasonable with reasonable authorities. I also hope that in the longer term we will find a fairer way to make sure that the electorate generally will have a direct say in the kind of spending local authorities carry out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments in this debate, because during it my local authority has been attacked on a number of occasions. I say " my local authority", conscious of the fact that there is another hon. Member present this morning in the Committee who attempts to claim to represent one half of that city. It is significant that in none of the debates, either here or in the House, have we heard from that hon. Member exactly how he feels about the attack being made on the local authority. We have not heard whether he supports the local authority in its actions, whether he supports the Government, or exactly what he intends to do. It will be interesting to see whether he manages to catch your eye, Mr. Gourlay, so that we can find out exactly where he stands in this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
say this in the hope that I might catch the Chairman's eye—that the debate on industry and employment is as important to the City of Dundee as the question of local authority finance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local employees who are threatened by the £2-75 million cut in the rate support grant, which the Secretary of State has suggested we should consider in Dundee, would be interested to know where the hon. Gentleman stands. Perhaps we shall find out in the next few days. It would be interesting to know whether he supports the elected authority in its attempts to preserve jobs in that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must challenge the word " overspend ". The Tories are talking not about overspending but about cutting as far as they can the right of local authorities to decide what is best for their electorates. The Tories are concerned about alleged overspending, but the electorate can decide on that issue in a year's time. I am certain that the current Labour representatives on regional councils will be returned then. I know that those Tory local authorities which have been cutting massively the services they provide, particularly Tayside, will find it very difficult to justify what is happening, and their attacks on local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Secretary of State a couple of questions, the answers to which we are entitled to know. Indeed my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton is still awaiting an answer to his question. Are rents an option? Certainly the director of finance in Dundee district council questions whether rents are an option. He refers to Scottish Office circular 7/1981 and certainly questions whether rents are an option. I should like to have an answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really would like an answer from the Minister on the assertion made over the weekend by Tayside regional council whether if Dundee district council accepts the points made by the Secretary of State for Scotland and decides to hand back some money or to cut the rates, and that involves the regional council in issuing new rate demands and charging the district council for issuing them, that would be fair. Does he think it is any sort of incentive. Is it the type of attitude that he would support from a Tory-controlled local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Act is quite clear. Where a district council decides to use its option of reducing the rates and the regional council as the collecting body has to carry out that exercise, the regional council is entitled to be reimbursed by the district council for the administrative costs of that exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has made that clear. Does he now think that that is either fair or is any incentive to' any local authority to consider it? What concerns Dundee, as it concerns all local authorities, is that the Government are talking about cutting back on employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State had a taste of exactly how the local authority workers in Dundee feel about his attack on Dundee district council when he was in Dundee yesterday. A meeting of 3,000 local authority workers heard from their elected
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
representatives exactly what the £2-75 million would mean to their job prospects. The right hon. Gentleman tried to evade the prospect that not only would it mean 500 employees being sacked in a full year, but, because the cuts would have to take place halfway through the year, 800 or 900 employees would be made redundant on the Secretary of State's option. One person on the labour exchange costs us £6,000 a year. If we are to put 500 on the labour exchange, it will cost the Secretary of State and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment £3 million a year. We do not see that as making any economic sense whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the real problems which face the Committee, which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) raised—industry and employment. Today, the figures for employment have been announced. The total of unemployed in Scotland has risen to 305,000—an increase of 19,000 over last month, at an added cost of £114 million. That is double what the Secretary of State is trying to claw back with his attack on local authority spending. Clearly, those are the economics of the madhouse, which no member of the Opposition is likely to urge local authorities to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is time to make only a few brief points. It is a fact, unfortunately, that debates on local government finance in this Committee usually leave the air hot with humbug. It was rather like that today as one observed the Secretary of State and the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) butting each other like two ageing bull elephants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolute humbug to suggest that the Government, by cutting expenditure in the way they are doing, are doing something unique. The Secretary of State was on a fair point there, because, if one looks at the Government expenditure White Paper and examines the table which shows local authority expenditure in Scotland at 1980 survey prices, we find that from 1975-76 to 1981-82 in real terms local government expenditure was cut by 16-3 per cent., and of that, in the period of the Labour Administration from 1975-76 to 1978-79, there was a reduction of 8-5 per cent. So we are seeing the continuation of a process that has been going on for some years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that Liberal Party policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. Unfortunately, I have no control over these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us about your policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate should be conducted through the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly think that, if I had a policy, it would make the situation any worse than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second piece of humbug is to suggest that increases in rates and/or reductions in services have nothing to do with Government, and that they are a matter of local government discretion. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
story that is all over the place—that overspending by local government is the fault of the regional authority or of the district authority—when the plain fact is that, by reducing rate support grant, the Government force local authorities either to raise the rates or to cut the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third piece of humbug is to suggest, as many Conservatives do, that legislation, such as the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act, in no way affects local democracy. That legislation is a direct attack on local democracy. I do not think it is far short of the truth to say that central Government now exercise a degree of control over local government which virtually destroys the original intentions of reorganisation. Those are not my words; they are a paraphrase of the words of the Earl of Minto in the debate in another place. In other words, it is not only Labour, Liberal or Nationalist Members making that accusation; it is made by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly Liberal policy to seek to strengthen rather than to weaken local democracy. We believe that a new finance system should give greater—not less—responsibility for raising revenue for services at local level. If the Government's consultative document is to be meaningful, it will have to give local authorities more, rather than less, financial responsibility. Therefore, it must set out the means for widening the tax base of local authorities. It seems to me that the road which the Government are now following would lead to 100 per cent, block grant and complete central Government control. The Government have increased the degree of detailed supervision of local government expenditure, and this—if hon. Members remember Wheatley—is completely against the doctrine of local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At every election I can remember the Conservatives have said that they would reform the rating system. They always say this at elections. Then the election comes and goes and we still have the same system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would echo the question asked I think, by the hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Douglas): in what respect do the Government believe that their consultative document will be different from Lay-field? That is a very reasonable question. Does the Secretary of State know whether there is to be a separate consultative document for Scotland, or is there to be just one for the United Kingdom? Will there be legislation before the election? The Liberal Party believes that the rating system is regressive and should be replaced. I personally see no way round having a local income tax as a central part of any financial reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would conclude—because I know there is pressure of time—by giving support to the idea of an efficiency audit, which was raised by the hon. Member for Dunfermline. He might be interested to know that a Liberal councillor from the Borders region—John McKerchar—has just persuaded that authority to establish a committee to review performance. That is an example of the kind of reform that we are seeking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State in his opening remarks, in an attempt to erect some sort of smokescreen to give some sort of respectability to his arguments, plunged into history and arrived, quite conveniently I think, in the year 1929. The Committee will remember that 1929 was the year of the great crash and the start of the great recession. I must confess that when I look at the unemployment figures which have just been circulated around the Committee, it seems to me that harking back to 1929 by a Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland is entirely appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to use too much time, but can I— and I am sure that I speak for all my hon. Friends —record our absolute dismay at seeing unemployment spiralling to 305,000 in Scotland. That is certainly the worst figure since the war. I believe that that figure will rightly haunt the Secretary of State and be a standing testimony to the total failure of his economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate has been very much dominated by section 14 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1981. That is inevitable, because it represents a sustained and obsessive attack by Conservative Ministers on local government independence. It strikes at the very essentials of local democracy. What the Secretary of State is trying to do, despite the denials of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), is to substitute accountability to himself and to his whim for accountability to the electorate. He is saying that his prejudices are going to be substituted for the assessment of genuine local needs by genuinely elected local councillors. It really is an extremely serious and damaging development. It is a form of reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is Younger's law of reaction, I suppose, because what local authorities are being told is that they can do what they like as long as what they like is what the Secretary of State wants. If we get to that situation, we shall have many councillors on both sides of the political divide saying that they are not prepared to soldier on in those circumstances and have their limited power of maneouvre finally eroded where it matters most—the ability to rate and vary their expenditure according to what they see as in the best interests of the people they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy of it all is that I do not believe that he is doing this because he personally believes in it. I believe he is doing it because the Treasury has told him that he must do it. That is a particularly sad state of affairs. He has erected this doubtful theory in an attempt to justify something that has been imposed upon him in exactly the same way as he is trying to impose it upon local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main argument that he has used is, I suppose, what he calls the runaway train theory—something he has whistled up for the event. Of course, the runaway train theory is just not true. If one takes local government expenditure as a proportion—I am talking here in United Kingdom terms, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
suspect Scotland would be very similar—as a proportion of gross national product, one sees that since the mid-1970s—1974 for example—it has fallen from 15.1 per cent. to 11.1 per cent. in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State likes to go and look at the COSLA critique—the booklet which I am sure he has read and studied, which was produced by a committee which included two prominent Conservatives, although political pressures on them subsequently made them nervous about what they had done—he will see simply set out that overspending by local government has been nothing like the overspending that has been perpetrated, if that is the right word, by central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is true to say that in the last year a gap between guidelines and estimates has emerged, but the reason is that the guidelines themselves have no objective validity. The guidelines are the judgment of the Secretary of State and his colleagues. The guidelines have been moved—moved very substantially—into a position which leaves local authorities in a hopeless position as regards their duties to the population they represent. Because they have not been able to meet these unreasonable targets, the Secretary of State has turned round and shouted from every housetop he can find, every soapbox he can stand on, the charge of irresponsibility. But it is a false charge brought about fraudulently by the v/ay in which the guidelines have been manipulated by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the figures are in the COSLA critique, I should be interested to know whether the Under-Secretary accepts the figures in that particular document. I believe most of them came from parliamentary questions answered by his right hon. Friend. But if the figures in there are to be common ground, it would be as well if the hon. Gentleman would confirm the fact so that we may have a useful basis for future debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "hit list" is an arbitrary list which is almost certainly vindictive. When I first saw it I assumed that all I would have to do would be to go to the guidelines and pick out the seven top authorities. But that is not so. My right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) made the point—and I think that we are all aware of this now —that a number of authorities, Banff and Buchan, Moray, Caithness, a whole range of impeccable true-blue or " independent" authorities are over the guidelines. Indeed they are much more over the guidelines than, say, Dumbarton which is 27-4 per cent. over. To tcke one example which will interest the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston)—and I thought that his attacks'and remarks about rogue elephants were a little unfortunate in view of his rather effete statement of his own party's position a few minutes later—he has a district council, Locha-ber, which is 35 per cent, over the guidelines and I presume that he will not say that it is irresponsible and has acted in a way which is a betrayal of the interests of the people who put the councillors in the council chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, naturally and understandably because he must, hurried to say that guidelines are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
the only criterion. It is difficult to understand exactly what the criteria are. We know, because we have seen the letters that have been sent to the individual authorities, that there are such matters as expenditure per head, volume change in expenditure and so on. But until we receive that information from all the other authorities in Scotland, it is difficult to see whether there is any rhyme, reason or consistency in the pattern of selection which has emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes, for example, expenditure per capita, Dumbarton, at 27.4 per cent. over, is in the ruck as regards exceeding the guidelines, but its expenditure per capita is only 11 per cent. over. That is extremely low compared with, for example, Moray which was 35.1 per cent. over guidelines and is 23.3 per cent. above the average in terms of per capita expenditure. One begins to see that one can start picking here and there and finding all sorts of inconsistencies and difficulties in what the Secretary of State has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a number of written questions designed to elicit exactly the information which has, apparently, been used in deciding which authority should be on the hit list. I was told that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost, but ' Rating Review' published annually by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Scottish Branch), contains some of the information requested. Copies have been made available in the Library."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 June 1981; Vol 6, c. 419.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider that and write to me with the information, because I say bluntly that I do not believe that the information is not available in his Department and it is unsatisfactory that I should be told that it cannot be provided because it would involve disproportionate cost. If I am to believe that, it means that the exercise of comparability, which is the essence of a section 14 designation, was not properly carried out because the information that would have allowed it to be carried out was not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the Minister, I do not think that that is the case. I believe that a decision was taken to withhold the information and that we can draw sinister conclusions about what would become apparent if that information were available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must leave the Minister time to reply, but I stress again one or two of the specific questions to which we want answers from the Under-Secretary, having singularly failed to get them from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we want to clarify the point about the £100 million. I am right, I hope, in thinking—it was rather opaque, but I thought I detected this from what the Secretary of State was saying—that there are three ways in which the £100 million can be found, and one is by budget review—if local authorities review their budgets and reduce their estimates accordingly, the reductions will be taken out of the £100 million. It is important that there should be no misunderstanding about that, and I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary will confirm that the Secretary of State made that point and that that is the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman say something about the authorities that are not on the " hit list"? We know that they have to find about £36 million, which is the balance between the £60 odd million which is coming from the seven and the £100 million target. If we have budget reviews or a compromise figure that is acceptable to the Secretary of State in terms of the section 14 clawbacks, will the shortfall resulting from that compromise be taken off the other authorities in a general reduction in rate support grant in the current year? The Government must know the answer, because even they must have done some contingency planning. We want a specific answer this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other challenge made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton was a specific one. He said, and I wish to repeat, that we have information in documents circulated by the Scottish Office and COSLA that there was discussion, and that there was a figure from COSLA that the proposed cuts would mean a reduction in teaching jobs of 6,000. That figure is certainly given currency by COSLA. Is it accepted by the Scottish Office? When that question was put by my right hon. Friend the silence from the Secretary of State could be described only as deafening. We are entitled to know what is implied by the cuts. That is a specific example. We want a specific reply to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add a simple question of my own. If orders are laid before the House to cut back on the rate support grant of certain authorities under section 14—let us assume that there could be as many as seven—will there be an individual order for each authority? That is important. We think that it is constitutionally inadmissible to do it in any other way. It is clearly essential that the House should be able to pass judgment individually on the varying circumstances that must apply in the case of each authority. I want to put that on the record. I want to know from the Secretary of State—I presume that it will be a mere formality—that there will be no question of one order covering more than one authority, and that the House will be able to debate and vote on each. I hope that that will take only 10 seconds of the Minister's speech as he hurries to confirm that that is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question is on the point that was made time and again to the Secretary of State and to which we had no satisfactory answer. What will happen if, in the terminology of the Secretary of State—which we do not accept, but which we are prepared to use because of the muddle to which we wish an explanation and an answer—a local authority is irresponsible and does not offer the sort of concession—or any concession—towards the total which the Secretary of State is demanding? What will happen to the statutory services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that any argument produced by the Secretary of State will be prefaced by the remark that he hopes that it will not happen and that the local authorities will capitulate to his force majeure. That is fair enough. I see that that must be his position. But it would be totally irresponsible if the Secretary of State were saying that he has made no contingency plan for central and statutory services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
If the right hon. Gentleman believes in informed debate and in open and honest government, he owes us an explanation of v/hat will happen if that sad situation results from the Government's policy. The Secretary of State said that there was machinery for councillors who were in default. Are the Government thinking, for example, of section 211 of the 1973 Act? What is in their minds? Would they step in to ensure that the old were cared for, that the young were educated, and that the statutory services were maintained? Or is this a remarkable example of Pontius Pilate politics—of putting on the table an impossible demand and, if people cannot meet that demand, sitting back and watching the whole of Scottish society being enveloped in chaos? That could happen if we went down the road with no positive reaction from the Secretary of State and no positive steps to save the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not, as the Secretary of State has suggested, a simple matter of " local authorities won't"; it is in many cases, we suspect, a case of " local authorities can't " meet the full demands of the Secretary of State. There are genuine difficulties about finding cuts totalling 17 per cent, of the budget of an authority in something like six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude on that point; the whole thing is a monument to Ministers' obstinacy. It is a campaign that has been conducted in the name of the ratepayers, but at the end of the day the ratepayers will be faced with disorganised services, massive redundancies and a legacy of bitterness between central and local Government which will probably not evaporate for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, because we shall have all the problems of deficits and future rate support grants. Ratepayers will be facing even larger rate burdens and rate bills in the coming year. It is a nightmare scenario.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the Under-Secretary the phrase that was used by the Secretary of State. He said, perhaps by a slip of the tongue, but I hope not, that he would be trying to persuade local authorities. One cannot use force or blackmail in such situations. One has to work by persuasion, or the Government will be the loser as surely as will be the ratepayers and local democracy in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that my right hon. Friend's choice of the year 1929 was appropriate. Indeed it was appropriate; he will recall that two years later the Labour Party went down to the greatest defeat in its electoral history. I have no doubt that that comparison will be more than adequately fulfilled in two or three years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me a specific question about what would be the effect of local authorities reducing their spending on the £100 million announced by my right hon. Friend. The Committee should be aware, as was made clear in the statement, that the £100 million overall reduction was based, according to existing budgets, on a volume overspend of £180 million. If either the selective
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
authorities reduce their expenditure or Scottish local authorities as a whole revise their budgets, as has been requested, the volume excess will come down from £180 million and we will clearly wish to take that into account in determining what should be done about any remaining excess, if, as seems likely, any excess remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craighton (Mr. Millan) and others suggested that the Government have used the powers of the new Act in an arbitrary fashion, because certain local authorities are above the guidelines and are not included in the initial list of authorities that have been written to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear that there is the possibility of a second list, but in any event I stress that, as local authorities and hon. Members have requested from the beginning—and the Government have conceded the point—guidelines are not the only criteria that will be taken into account. As letters to local authorities have made clear, we have looked not only at guidelines, but at growth, expenditure per capita, whether there are special demographic considerations and rates poundages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may refer to some of the local authorities that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, I do not exclude the possibility that they may be included in any subsequent list. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned previously West Lothian, a Labour authority excluded from the original list, although it is 30 per cent, above the Government's guidelines. One of the factors to take into account has been the major population changes in West Lothian. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Banff and Buchan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants us to include West Lothian, we will take it into account. I will not give way, because I have a lot to say. Hon. Members will forgive me if, on that basis, I do not give way. It has been made clear that demographic changes are one of the considerations. I simply mention that in the case of West Lothian. It has had significant population changes. In the case of Banff and Buchan we have to take into account the fact that its proposed budget involves a 7-7 per cent, cut compared with last year and it had no rate increase in the current year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Myles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I would rather not. In the case of Moray district council, we have to take into account that rates were reduced by 20 per cent, for the current year. That also is a factor that we have to take into account, because we all agree that guidelines should not be the single consideration in determining which authorities should be written to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other major points that have been raised by hon. Gentlemen. They asked what will happen if a local authority refuses to consider any reduction in its expenditure and, as a consequence, there is a substantial loss of rate support grant and a problem for the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
First of all, I should make it abundantly clear that a local authority that loses rate support grant and does not get the Secretary of State's consent to borrow has no alternative but to reduce its expenditure. The only question is whether it does so voluntarily at an early stage in the year or docs so involuntarily, but much more painfully, much later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what happens if a local authority goes bankrupt. First of all, let us be quite clear. When we use the term " bankrupt" in the case of a local authority, it does not mean that the authority's liabilities are greater than its assets, which is what the term normally means. What we are talking about is the situation where a local authority runs out of cash to pay its bills. I say, quite clearly and unequivocally, that the position of those who lend to local authorities is utterly and entirely safeguarded. The lending to a local authority in Scotland, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, is and will remain a first charge on that local authority. Therefore, irrespective of whatever happens, those who normally, legally and lawfully lend to local authorities are not in one whit affected by any proposals. Their position is entirely safeguarded. They need have no fear and no concern as to the implications of a situation of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>MrRifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way, because I have a number of other points that I want to make on this matter and we are running very short of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what the Government's position would be if a local authority completely refused to contemplate any reduction. Clearly, a local authority, if it were to consider such an irresponsible course of action, would in a fairly short time be unable to meet its bills. The local authority would then have to make reductions in its spending [HON. MEMBERS: "No,"] Hon. Gentlemen must appreciate that once the Government have withdrawn—if they do withdraw—rate support grant from an individual authority, the Government will no longer be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not the slightest possibility of the Government bailing out a local authority that has throughout this whole exercise refused to make a penny cut in its expenditure and, as a consequence, later in the year it cannot meet its bills. If local authorities are concerned about redundancies and the effect on vital services, they must appreciate that the later in the year any necessary reductions are made, the greater will be the effect on jobs and vital services. That is a simple fact of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have said to local authorities is that if at this stage in the process they come to Government and say " These are the savings that we think can be made and these are the savings that we are prepared to make ", we will listen and try to respond flexibly and responsibly to representations that are received. It may then be possible for a solution to be accepted—at least as the basis of a necessary agreement between the various parties. The local authorities concerned simply cannot say " We refuse to do anything now. We refuse to make any approach
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
to the Secretary of State. We refuse to contemplate any reductions in expenditure."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They can do it, but they must accept the consequences. The consequences will be between them and their employees and the local community. That is one of the facts of life for local authorities, as it would be for anybody else who refused to consider any reduction in expenditure regardless of the economic circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) made various claims about what would happen in Lothian regional council. What was significant about the hon. Gentleman's contribution was that, even on the Lothian regional council's figures, which it is prepared to publish at the present lime, he was conceding that on education alone-half the budget—£10 million can be saved without any effect on jobs. If that is half of the budget, then presumably £20 million can be achieved, taking the whole of the budget, without even considering jobs. When we consider that Lothian region in the past 12 months actually increased its manpower by 600 and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) mentioned, is still making new appointments and recruiting new employees, the hon. Gentleman cannot expect us to take that sort of point too seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not, I am sure, wish to mislead the Committee. The fact of the matter is that the £10 million he mentioned that can be saved includes a lot of maintenance and capital expenditure. Certainly, one can cut that for one year, but it is not the kind of revenue expenditure one can indefinitely lose. It means more, not less, expenditure next year if one cuts the backlog in the maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon Gentleman is advising his friends in Lothian region to come to the Secretary of State and make their proposals for reductions in expenditure. We shall then be able to examine these claims in better detail. When hon. Gentlemen say how distressed and concerned they are about possible job losses as a result of the Government's actions, they fail continually to take any account of job losses caused by excessive rates increases. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East mentioned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says " No evidence ". I will give him some evidence. I will not give way, because I want to give the hon. Gentleman the evidence that he talks about. He mentioned the Lothian region, for example, and the effect of rates increases. I can tell him that my right hon. Friend received a letter from a freezing and cold storage firm in Broxburn saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Our immediate reaction has been to dismiss two, and put three of our staff on short time working of one week in every three. The remaining staff, including our management, have taken a 20% cut in salaries."</p></blockquote>
That was the response of one company in Lothian region.

Another firm, in Newbridge in Lothian said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The additional burden in this rating year, in Lothian Region alone, will be in excess of £35,000 or the equivalent of 10 jobs."</p></blockquote>
A potato merchant and grower in Musselburgh, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, has said that, in the event of rate increases of this kind, he will be required to change the whole structure of his business, to make staff redundant and to close his potato store. That is multiplied throughout the whole of the Lothian region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

rates increases proposed in local authorities. Excessive rates increases have the most direct and inevitable implications for jobs. Hon. Gentlemen know that they cannot conceal that fact. But they are trying to produce a smoke-screen to try to conceal the implications of excessive rates increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis on which rate support grant is provided to local authorities allows for a teacher-pupil ratio in Scotland which is higher than it has ever been before. On that basis the Government have no apology to make for their recommendations on education. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South was right to point out that many of the job increases in local authorities over the past few years have been not in teaching, but in non-teaching posts, thereby being of little benefit to the pupils.

A council tenant came to see me at my surgery last Saturday. She said that she had been told as an employee of Lothian regional council that one-third of all jobs in Lothian might go. Her reaction to that was to say that she was aghast. I said " Why are you aghast? " She said " It is because I see the waste that goes in in the local authority. If it has to make savings, it can make them without the consequences for employment that Labour councillors are going round making scare-mongering claims about."
