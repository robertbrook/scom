	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from col. 356]</p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee was suspended I was referring to the Warnock report, paragraph 10.109, which explained how discretionary payments were given to youngsters who applied to the Supplementary Benefits Commission. But the Committee also explained that it was disturbed to see that only 700 handicapped people were receiving benefit on the grounds outlined in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asking the Minister whether any action had been taken as suggested in the report which urged the local offices—the DHSS I presume—to consult
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local careers officer and the Disablement Resettlement Officer as to whether or not a handicapped young person is likely to be able to enter open employment."</p></blockquote>
There must be some figures available in the Department and I should be grateful if the Minister could give us not only that information but up-to-date figures on the number of people who are currently in receipt of these payments. The paragraph from which I have just quoted gives the 1976 figure. If there are any more up-to-date figures, I should like to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I think is valid in the context of amendment No. 78 is the reference to Scotland in the report. Paragraph 10.108 explains:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Scotland responsibility for the financial support of handicapped young people who wish to continue their education is divided between the education authorities and the Scottish Education Department. The Scottish education authorities have discretionary powers to assist persons, including handicapped pupils and students, who are ordinarily resident in their areas."</p></blockquote>
The report does not give any figures and I wonder whether the Minister has any figures, collected nationally, of the number of people who are in receipt of those discretionary payments. If he does not have those figures, I should: be interested to know the limits to which local authorities have to agree. Are the limits completely discretionary or is the sky the limit? I suspect not. I suspect that it depends upon the means, or otherwise, of a local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point which sums up our case is the report's reference to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Financial support for young people to continue their education".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 10.103 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our recommendations for increased opportunities for young people with special needs to continue their education will be to little avail unless adequate financial assistance is available to attract them to stay on at school or to undertake courses of further education."</p></blockquote>
That is the crux of the matter. We may have the best intentions in the world but if we do not provide
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
the wherewithal to translate those intentions into positive action it is a confidence trick. I warn the Minister that when we debate clause stand part, we shall devote the greater part of the debate to that matter. In the evidence given to Warnock and the Special Standing Committee that sat on these matters during the last few weeks, almost every organisation involved with the welfare of those people makes the same point. It is no good the Minister repeating his points. The brief comes out of No. 10 and he may as well have the same old gramophone record which he could switch on saying, "We do not have the resources." We do have the resources. It is just a question of how they are distributed and what our priorities are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the amount of money involved in the amendment or, indeed, in the implementation of the Warnock report is chicken feed compared to figures that we can produce in other areas of Government expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that when we were discussing the Social Security (No. 2) Bill, I had the Blue Book on defence. We can tell him where to get the money if the Government are genuinely concerned with the welfare of the disabled and the handicapped. The resources are there, but the will to redistribute them is missing. Politics are about priorities and ours are totally different from the Minister's. He says that the Government have a mandate, but they do not have a mandate on this issue. Let them go to the country. We are prepared to go to the country and fight on the priorities involved in this Bill compared with other areas of endeavour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us some of the information that I have asked for and will try to answer some of the questions raised in this debate. In this debate we are working against a background of the slashing cuts that will be made in the education budget over the next few years according to the expenditure White Paper. We have to see the intentions of the Bill in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that we are all for helping the handicapped. That is like saying that we are all against sin; it does not get us very far unless the resources to tackle the problem are provided. That is the main burden of our complaint. So long as the resources are not there, it is so much eyewash to pretend that there will be measurable differences in the provisions for those people as outlined in the Bill. Unless we have the resources— the teachers, buildings and other facilities—it is a waste of time for the Committee to talk about the matter at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had another interesting debate although it was split up by the fact that we broke for a Division and for food and other sustenance. Three Opposition Members have spoken in the debate: the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who is currently leading the Opposition, the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) whose speeches we always admire because of his many years' experi
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
ence in the House and his knowledge of the technicalities ol how the place operates. However, I shall try to answer the points raised to the best of my ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that we are again back to our good old friend the resource element or the injection of finance which is another way of saying, "Spend the taxpayers' money." The hon Member for Fife, Central was right to say that it is a question of priorities and that we could cut this and cut that. That is a matter for argument between the two parties and it does not affect the Bill or the amendments under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said—the same old gramophone record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion. The fact remains that if the overall resources are not increased, something else has to be cut. I know that the hon Gentleman feels that we should cut defence and so on, but this amendment covered the whole extent of resource.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would the total cost have been if the Warnock recommendations had been implemented in full?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister would be out of order if he even attempted to answer that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for West Stirlingshire spoke similarly on the same subject. On the points that he and the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) raised about supplementary benefits and discretionary grants, I shall get the figures. I shall either write or have them by Thursday. I cannot give the hon Members the information tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to tell the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that we do not know what the Scottish figures are, but no limit is fixed by the Government: it is completely discretionary. I have taken note of the hon Gentleman's quotation from page 197 of Warnock, which has certain financial implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the gramophone record from the Government, I had to sit for five long years in Opposition and I heard the other side of the gramophone record with (the same notes and the same brief. There is nothing new there in the way in which Parliament works. I do not think that that point was of great material benefit to the debate. After all, on the hon Gentleman's final point about whether we fought and lost or won, we fought on our manifesto and won.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the hon Member for West Stirlingshire was such a great devolutionist. I thought that he was rather anti-SNP. However, in the United Kingdom, the manifesto upon which we fought was carried substantially. No doubt, if they want the redistribution of resources,
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
hon Gentlemen can fight in a different way next time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the important point about supplementary benefit, will he comment on the allegations in the Wamock report which, with reference to the supplementary benefit for disabled students in Scotland, suggest that there is a disparity between different areas of the United Kingdom in the application of discretionary awards to the detriment of people in some areas of Scotland? Will the Minister give us an assurance that, he will write not only to me and to the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) but, more importantly, to every voluntary organisation in Scotland concerned with the disabled, backing up the letter with a pamphlet outlining the rights of parents and those of young people in this context to claim supplementary benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared, as I said earlier, to write to the hon Members for West Stirlingshire and Fife, Central on the matters about which I said I would write to them. I am not prepared to say that I shall write as widely as the hon Gentleman has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon Gentlemen the information that I agreed to give. If they wish to circulate it, that is up to them. I shall certainly not commit myself to a wider circulation of the information that I promised. However, before I leave this point, I would remind the hon Gentlemen that Warnock recommended—it is there to be read—that education authorities should make generous provision for grants to the 16-to-19-year-olds but did not recommend mandatory grants. This is Consistent with our approach: it is advice, not a statutory duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, will the Minister not concede that, in the absence of mandatory grants, the allocation of discretionary grants tends to be uneven and that on a matter such as this it would be desirable that local authorities have a duty rather than simply a power, given 'the importance of such financial awards? Furthermore, in the present climate it is desirable that the funding should come from the Government and not be raised at the discretion of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that we should implement Warnock to the best of our ability. Warnock is clear on this matter: it did not recommend mandatory grants but said, basically, that grants should be generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister does not mind being pressed on this matter. It is important to recognise that Warnock recommended a far more generous allocation of discretionary grants by local education authorities. Will the Minister ensure that education authorities have enough resources to be more generous in their distribution of discretionary awards to students?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are back to our old friends injection of capital, taxpayers' money and redistribution of resources. I must repeat for the third and final time to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire that Warnock did not suggest mandatory grants. Generous, yes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More generous—I accept that, but not mandatory, and that is what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities already have powers to make awards to help young people to stay on at school or to undertake further education. Those powers do not distinguish 'between those with disabilities and others and in my view that is right and fully consistent with the recommendations of the Warnock committee. While everyone must sympathise with the difficulties of young people with handicaps, there is no reason for providing that they must be given higher school bursaries, irrespective of the circumstances, and especially of the financial circumstances of their families. I am satisfied that in practice no strengthening of the present position is required in this respect. But the guidance we shall issue about young persons with special educational needs staying on at school will call attention to the financial implications. I therefore ask hon Members to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer was, as my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said, like a broken record. The tune has gone; it has no meaning, it is cracked and his remarks do not make any sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps saying that all the Opposition want is the expenditure of more money. We are saying—I said it in reply to his previous contribution—that we are not asking for more money to be spent on education. We are asking for the same sum to be spent, because with a declining school roll that money will be spent on a smaller number of children and therefore each child will receive more money. That seems to be the way in which we can improve the education service while not spending more public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have tabled an amendment which suggests a course of action. If the Minister says time and again that it will cost money and the Government are not prepared to spend money, he ought to be able to tell us how much it would cost and be prepared to give us hard figures on this and other amendments. We could then judge the commitment, or lack of commitment, by the Government to the disabled and to those with learning difficulties and compare it with other costs in the public sector that we do not consider so essential and which we might be prepared, whether or not Conservative Members agree, to see cut or even abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a responsibility to give us figures so that we know what the estimates would have been. If he cannot do that, we shall have to make our own estimates and give our own comparisons and he may find that that will be more damaging
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
than if he were to give them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to press the amendment to a vote. We are not impressed with the Minister's reply. We are no more impressed than we were with his other replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a good reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) had been listening to the reply—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may have read his hon Friend's brief. It is shameful to use Warnoek in this manner as an excuse for inaction when the report does not request action, and as an excuse for ignoring something because the Government cannot afford it when it does require action. That is a despicable way of using the report and we should like the amendment to be pushed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment. The Minister talks about politics being the language of priorities, and that is so. But if the Minister in turn were to consider consulting taxpayers about the subject, I think that he would find that an investment of this type would be more agreeable to them than would many other items of Government expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a stage in life when one has to pay for things that are worth while, when one has the chance to put forward a statutory solution giving powers and when those powers can be reinforced with investment so that the job produced at the end of the Committee proceedings is not botched or half-hearted. We can create a new system which will have the investment behind it to make it work adequately. The fatal flaw in the Government's proposals in relation to the Warnock recommendations is their lack of willingness to put in the necessary investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister looks exasperated, but it would be interesting if he were to put that point to the electorate in a limited	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> referendum—although we know that that is not possible. But judging the subject by our own litmus paper, and by our own standards as politicians, I am sure that people would go along with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the feelings of the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). It has not been my habit to intervene much, or to speak at great length. Provided that the same amount of cash resources are available for the current year, I wish that hon Member would tell us where he would find the money. The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) told us quite clearly that expenditure would be saved from defence. Will the hon Member for Dundee, East say where he will remove it from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be taken from the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take money from the assisted places scheme would be an excellent way of saving it, but in the context of my political background I should say that Scotland is the last country of which one could say that it does not have the money. We shall produce £4,000 million worth of oil this year—yet none of that will be available for investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked me a question. If he wants to take money from United Kingdom funds, savings from the assisted places scheme would be an excellent way of doing it. If he wishes to look at the question from a purely Scottish point of view he can take the money both from oil and from the assisted places fund, because that fund is something which people in Scotland do not want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 14, line 22, leave out "Record" and insert "Statement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small amendment, but if the Government accept it, I imagine that there will have to be about 80 consequential amendments to change the wording in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the amendment is well known to members of the Committee. The Warnock report recommended that the document should be called the "record". When I first read that suggestion in the report, I did not think that it was the best name that could have been chosen. For the English Education Bill, currently being considered in another Standing Committee, the Secretary of State for Education and Science decided to change the word from "record" to "statement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled my amendment in the hope that my hon Friend might consider changing "record" to ^'statement", for two reasons. First, the word "record" has certain connotations	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup -->—"helping the police with their inquiries", and records of that kind —although I accept that the word "statement" has some equal drawbacks. Secondly, as not many people are involved in or affected by this area, I think that it would be better if the same title were used both north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon Friend to give the matter serious consideration, even though there would have to be an
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
enormous number of consequential amendments to nearly every line of this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) has said. We may think that the nomenclature in this part of the Bill is of secondary importance, but such matters can be of importance in the eyes of many people. If we look at recent Scottish educational history, or even the contemporary scene in Scottish education, we find that some of the terms used are unfortunate. The Minister should look at some of the terminology used in Scottish education, because it creates prejudices in some people's minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, the term "list D school".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a very narrow amendment. I hope that the hon Gentleman will restrict himself to the words in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understand that. The hon Gentleman wishes to replace the word "record" by the word "statement". I gave the example "list D school" to show how important terminology can be. What is a list A school, a list B school, or a list C school? Where did "list D" appear from? And now here is this business of a child having a record. As the hon Member for Argyll clearly insinuated, a record could mean something quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman have a record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have no record of which I am aware, but perhaps the Minister should ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland or the Criminal Records Office—although it has often been proven recently that the Scottish Criminal Records Office has made mistakes. It may be that I am on its records. I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman suggested the word "statement" rather than "record". The word "statement" has different connotations. Most of the statements that have been made in Parliament recently have been such rubbish in content that the term "statement" has been virtually discredited by the Ministers who have made them.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the terminology suggested by his hon Friend and my own suggestion that the word "assessment" should be used rather than "record". Perhaps on Report the Government can bring forward a suitable amendment. It is perhaps not the most important thing in the Bill, but in some people's eyes it is, nevertheless, important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come into the debate now simply to support what was said by the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay)—a very unusual thing. I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that you will allow me to 	<i>give</i> an example of why I think the hon Gentleman has brought something very important to the Committee's attention, particularly when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
we are talking about Warnock and children who will be in a special category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me about this whole debate is that we tend to use the words "disability" and "handicap" as though they have the same meaning. I am not disabled, but one of my handicaps—I have admitted this in a Committee before—is that my experience of educational matters is not as great as that of other hon Members on both sides of the Committee who are members of the teaching profession. In this International Year of Disabled People it is important that we get the terminology right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of children start with enough disadvantages anyway. If we add the word "record", we do not help those children in any way. Like my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), I think that the word "statement" might also not be the best word, but perhaps the Minister will say that he will consider the matter and suggest a word on Report. I do not think that the word "assessment" is an improvement, because it still has connotations that people who are starting off under a disadvantage might not like. Even the first page of the Warnock report gives us new terminology to use in talking about this group of children and young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this may be a short debate, it is very important. I thank the hon Gentleman for bringing this matter to the Committee's attention and I hope that when the Minister replies he will recognise the category of young people and children about whom we are talking and will say that on Report he will produce a more suitable word than "record".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that to some extent my hon Friends and the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. Mac-Kay) are indulging in semantics. This is not such an important change that we need to have a long debate on it. The word "record" may have a certain connotation for some people, but, with all due respect to my hon Friends, we all know that, however one changes the names of certain people or functions, they will continue to be called them by the old name. People still go to the "Buroo" even though it is now the social security office, the unemployment office or whatever it might be. People still use the old name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may put one serious objection, which is a language objection. To me the word "statement" implies finality—that there is a final point: one makes the statement and that is it. A record, however, is something that is maintained and added to, and continues. For that reason, if for no other, to get the language right I cannot vote for the amendment on the basis of the word "statement", even if I accept some of the points that my hon Friends and the hon Gentleman have made about the term "record".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon Friend is not suggesting that we are putting the amendment forward flippantly. He said that the old words would still be used, but the summary of the Warnock recommendations introduces the term "children with learning difficulties". I hope that everyone in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
Committee and in the teaching profession will use that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we so determine in the Committee and the House agrees that the word "record" should be changed, I hope that those outside in the teaching profession will accept it and use that terminology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much take my hon Friend's point about learning difficulties. As I said earlier, we are talking about children with learning difficulties, which is not the same as disabled children or children with mental disabilities. We are talking about some children Who at a specific point in their lives, for whatever reason, are having difficulty at school. That is what learning difficulty is. Some of those children, for instance those who suffer from dyslexia, may have considerable learning difficulties, but many of them have IQs way above average. They are in no way mentally handicapped, except in that one sphere. Therefore the term "learning difficulties" is a very good and exact phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that if we use the word "record", that is the terminology that everybody should use. But "statement" to me implies finality, whereas "record" implies something that is continuing and therefore can be added to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) shakes his head at that. I know that I should not refer to them, but the Minister's advisers are all nodding in agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is well briefed on the amendment and will not talk about increased expenditure, because the amendment is blatantly inflationary—nine letters instead of six, repeated many times in the Bill. The public sector borrowing requirement will "Go for a Burton" as a direct consequence of accepting the amendment and having to reprint the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman can make a speech if he feels so moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when the mental health legislation was going through the House the original Bill referred to the establishment of a mental health board. The first amendment to the Bill was to leave out "board" and insert "Commission". The arguments adduced then were more or less those that have been adduced now—that the parents of those affected by the legislation are highly sensitive about the terminology used about their children. The word "board" smacked of the nineteenth century and it was eventually eliminated from the legislation, which now refers to "Mental Health Commission". The same applies here. The word "record" has almost a criminal connotation. It may not be felt by us, but if one has a child and somebody says in a sneering way "That child has a record", the parent immediately wilts under such a smear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not as trivial a matter as some hon Members might assume. I hope that the Minister will give us a reasoned argument showing Why he will accept or reject the amendment and will have no regard to the public sector borrowing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
requirement or to any built-in inflationary tendency inherent in accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that we have touched a very sensitive note in this matter of records. If we are concerned about the number of letters and are looking for brevity, I suggest that the word "log" might be appropriate. It is used in many other ways. All aircrew keep logs, which are the records of what has happened when they have been flying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that you will appreciate my dilemma. I know that it is not your duty to help me. I am about to side with the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and to oppose my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). That is a tricky position for me. I shall try to explain why this has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Argyll said that it might involve eight consequential amendments, but in fact it would require 83. Although it would possibly not take the PSBR much higher than it is now, it might have some minor financial effects. I agree with the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that at last—and it is a Government amendment—there is an amendment with substantial financial implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is that the words "assessment", "record", '"log" and various others have been suggested. When working on a Bill such as this many views are expressed about words that should be used, and I think that we have probably achieved the best word. In this respect I agree with the hon Member for Cathcart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) made a good point when he said "The police require you to make a statement". As the hon Member for West Stirlingshire pointed out, there is some difficulty whichever word one uses. If one considers "record"—what about a record high jump? It depends on one's interpretation. If one took all the words suggested in the debate, depending on the connotation that one gives them, one could come up with different answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Argyll, who is in the educational profession, has thought about and studied the matter seriously. If I may deal with the merits of his amendment, I suggest that it seems to be a matter of personal taste, perhaps even of literary taste. There are erudite Members on both sides of the House who, unlike myself, can talk about such matters at length. I shall confine myself to the mundane arguments of the practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who object to the word "record" seem to associate it with a criminal record, but it might be an athletic record or some other form of record. That is by no means a necessary association of thought, especially in relation to children in Scotland. Thanks to our system off children's hearings, of which I believe all of us on the Committee are proud, children do not have that kind of record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word! has many positive and agreeable associations. It puts many people in mind of world
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
records, Olympic records, gramophone records, the records of learned societies, the 	<i>Guinness Book of Records,</i> and even the records of the lengths of speeches that some Opposition Members have made in this Committee. We are all familiar with the process by which words that at first are positive, or at least neutral, become conditioned by the thing to which they refer. Thus, reformatories have to be renamed, and the hon Member for West Stirlingshire mentioned approved schools, list D schools— and I dare say that many may think, that it is time we sought another name for them. If the hon Member has another suggestion for list D schools, no doubt he will pass it to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The records about which we are talking in the Bill are a new facility, designed to improve the lot of children with serious disabilities and to show how they can be helped and, through time, how they have benefited. So far as I am concerned, any word applied in that way will acquire good connotations, not bad ones. It is literally a record of how we are dealing with and trying to improve and help the child's circumstances and education through the record that we are recording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a brief but interesting debate. I am sorry that a better word than either of those on the Amendment Paper was not thrown up. The word "log" means something mathematical to me. I am left in the dilemma that I still do not approve of the word "Record" but, equally, I am not happy about "Statement". I was not happy when I put it down, but that was the word which was used in the English Bill. Therefore, I ask my hon Friend to continue to consider the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted what the hon Member for Argyll said when urging the Minister to think seriously about the matter between now and Report stage. Possibly, when the Warnock committee was set up, there was some discussion about the terms of reference and about the terminology that should be used to describe those children. The report eventually referred to children with special educational needs. Therefore, now that they have been so identified, is it all that difficult to continue to refer to them as children with special educational needs rather than referring to them as children with a record, or recorded children? I urge the Minister to think about that. To impress that on him, the Committee should not allow the amendment to be withdrawn, because there is nothing better to concentrate his mind than forcing the matter to a Division. If the hon Member for Argyll sticks to his guns—we shall give him as much support as we can muster on this side—perhaps we shall defeat the Government for the first time in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 14, line 30, leave out from "authority" to end of line 36 and insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 105 and 106.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 89 is purely a drafting amendment related to amendments Nos. 105 and 106. Amendment No. 105 will enable the Secretary of State, when making regulations governing disclosure of the records, to distinguish between those to whom an education authority will be obliged to disclose the record, and those to whom it will be enabled to disclose it. The Government intend that the former category will certainly include the parents, as recommended by Warnock, as well as the professionals who are involved in reviews of the records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 takes account of the need to distinguish between those, such as parents, with a right of unrestricted access to the record, and those who may be granted access in particular circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I> beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 15, line 1, after "assessment", insert "by teachers and others".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 80, in page 15, line 1, after "assessment", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"by teachers and other members of a multidisciplinary panel".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were tabled independently, although their effect would be the same. Amendment No. 73 came out of representations from a variety of groups who felt that the restrictiveness of the assessment procedure which covered only educational psychologists, medical people, and so on should also include teachers, because, in many instances, teachers were closest to the youngsters. They probably spent more time with them than any other group or individual, and it was felt that they had a positive contribution to make and that that should be formalised by inclusion in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is almost self-explanatory. We should be interested to hear the Minister's reasons, if any, for objecting to it. I do not think that teachers will require a fee for this work. I recognise that members of the medical profession are inclined to charge for specific services over and above what they would regard as the call of duty, and I am not sure whether they would be liable to extract extra charges from the Exchequer for this purpose. But the impression that we have received from members of the teaching profession and teaching organisations is that
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
they were very keen to be included in the Bill in a formal sense and we should be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, which is entitled "Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill", refers specifically at the top of page 15 to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"process of assessment including a medical examination and a psychological examination for the purpose of affording to the authority advice as to his"—</p></blockquote>
that is a child's—
	<br><blockquote><p>"special educational needs and whether or not they ought to record him".</p></blockquote>
If this is an education Bill, surely it is very strange that no reference is made to the educational assessment of a child by an educationally qualified person. With no disrespect to the medical profession and the educational psychologists, who I am sure do a good job, in many cases the professionally qualified person closest to the child for the greater part of the child's waking day, is the teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is statutory provision for examination by a doctor and a psychologist, why is there not statutory provision for the kind of multi-disciplinary assessment referred to in the Warnock committee report? "Multi", in case the Minister does not know, means "many". This is not a multi-disciplinary assessment —it is a bi-disciplinary assessment. Only two professional people are mentioned: one medical and one psychological. There is no mention of the educational professional—the teacher—or any other professional who may have something to say about the matter, such as a paediatrician or a psychiatrist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought to read again what Warnock has to say about multi-disciplinary assessments. It is a gaping loophole in an education Bill to make no statutory provision for the teacher to play a role in what should be a multi-disciplinary assessment process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only I who say that, but the largest teaching union in Scotland. The Educational Institute of Scotland supports the principle of these amendments. The institute states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present statutory provision for assessment and recording which the Government proposes to retain and which bases assessment finally on medical and psychological examination, supported as appropriate by reports from teachers, are highly unsatisfactory."</p></blockquote>
The institute has among its members many professionally qualified teachers who have spent most, if not all, of their working lives dealing with such children. When the institute has formulated a policy on these matters, it has done so after listening to the views of the teachers in our special schools and in ordinary schools who deal with children with special educational needs in an integrated structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Examinations by psychologists and doctors vary considerably in effectiveness while the education service itself has only a consultative or supportive optional role."</p></blockquote>
I think that that is wrong. I think that the Government have got their priorities the wrong way round. The Minister says that he wants to implement Warnock. Warnock was about children with special educational needs, with the emphasis on "educational".
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
The Bill is called an education Bill. Not to include the educationally qualified person who may be in daily contact with the child and has far more opportunity to assess the child's progress or otherwise in this multi-disciplinary panel of assessment seems a glaring omission in the legislation. It is no wonder that the EIS concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The teachers with whom a child spends much more time than with a doctor or psychologist know much more about the child and it is only common sense to involve them in multi-professional assessment schemes."</p></blockquote>
I am not saying that the teacher is an expert on other things. The teacher is not an expert on the medical needs of a child, nor may he be an expert on the child's psychological assessment. But very often it is the teacher who sees that there is something wrong. I am not talking only about children with special educational needs. It is often the teacher who sees that there is something wrong with the child, such as illness, whether temporary or otherwise. Sometimes the teacher observes that a child's disability or handicap is impeding his or her educational progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is often the teacher who sees the link between the child's impediment and his educational progress, or otherwise. It is often the teacher who suggests bringing in the doctor or the psychologist. To exclude the teacher completely from the team to assess the child—I know that the Bill does not say that but it has statutory inclusion of the medical and psychologist professionals but not statutory inclusion of the educational professional—is an insult to the teaching profession. I hope that the Minister will look at this carefully and consider an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to hear a reasoned speech from the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) on matters which he knows about from his own experience. 1 accept much of what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put some of the Government's views and suggest a possible long-term remedy to this problem. In regard to amendment No. 73, we have no quarrel with the intention underlying the amendment. We entirely recognise and accept that the assessment of special educational needs is a matter in which teachers are essentially involved. The recommendation of the Warnock committee, however—which we accept—is that every assessment should be a multi-disciplinary assessment. This means that the precise make-up of the team will vary widely from child to child and will include not only teachers, doctors and psychologists, but also professionals from a wide range of health services and social work services and others. For that reason we have not attempted to spell out in the Bill the range of contributions to be made by different groups, beyond mentioning the components at present included in the current provisions for ascertainment, set out in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is to give guidance on all those matters once the new provisions become law. I shall not go further at present, but shall turn to amendment No. 80. Again, I recognise the feeling that the Bill is insufficiently explicit about the role of the educationist in
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
assessment and about our commitment to the multi-disciplinary approach to special educational needs. Assessment is a complex process—and the make-up of the assessment team will vary from child to child—and we think it preferable that the entire matter should be the subject of detailed guidance once the new provisions become law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of necessity, we have retained the references to the medical and psychological components which at present contribute towards ascertainment and which require the physical presentation of the child for examination. We do not want to be too prescriptive beyond that point. We would be willing to consider the matter further. We may not reach a different opinion, but it is entirely open to Opposition Members to raise the matter on Report because we shall definitely consider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's assurances, I think that I speak on behalf of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) when I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Government amendments Nos. 108 and 109, we are trying to do what the Opposition are asking for in amendments Nos. 83 and 87. Most of the amendments are concerned with the question of the "named person".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 108 is intended to ensure that a parent who is told by an education authority that his child is to be assessed to determine the extent of his special educational needs is automatically provided with a contact point in the authority who can give him information and advice and, where necessary, reassurance about the assessment process. I am sure hon Members on both sides of the Committee will welcome this amendment as a positive step to assist parents and alleviate any anxieties they may have at a time when they may be beginning to come to terms with the fact that their child may have special educational needs. This is, of course, an extension of the Warnock proposal that there should be a "named person", once the needs are known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our original thought with regard to this was that it should be left to be dealt with in regulations. But there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
is clear evidence from many quarters of a desire that it should be dealt with in the parent statute, and I am happy to accede to the representations that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of Government amendment No. 109 is to require an education authority to supply a parent with the name and address of a person who can provide him with advice and information concerning his recorded child's special educational needs and to do the same for a recorded young person. We introduce it in response to the wide support given to the Warnock committee's recommendation of a "named person" to assist parents. This person need not be employed by the authority. We have left the position open so that it may be a health visitor, social worker or other professional person. The important thing is that he or she should be acceptable to the parents or the youngster. I know that this proposal will be welcomed generally by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know why the draftsmen of the legislation did not include the proposal in the first place. Without pressure from Opposition Members, I doubt whether the Government amendment would have appeared. It is significant that amendment No. 83, which stands in my name and proposes a named person, was tabled before the Government amendment. The Government amendment is starred and may be technically better drafted than mine. I would be willing not to press amendment No. 83 provided that the Minister can give us some assurance in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"name of the officer of the authority from whom advice and further information may be obtained".</p></blockquote>
That means, presumably, the education authority. What if the named person is not an employee of the authority at all? That named person may be a health visitor—an employee of the health board—or he may be an employee of the regional or islands council. But if he is a social worker, for example, he will be in a different department. Is amendment No. 108 well-enough drafted? It must have been drafted in a terrible hurry. Our amendments did not appear on the Amendment Paper until Monday. We know the tremendous stresses and strains that are put on people at Dover House and St Andrew's House because of the incompetence of Ministers and the fact that poor civil servants have to cover up for mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure us that the very hurriedly-drafted amendment is good enough to encompass the situation where the named person is not necessarily an officer of the education authority, but may be a health

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to diminish in any way the efforts of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), but I suspect that this is one piece of legislation that was left out intentionally. So far as I can see, there are always crumbs of comfort which can be brushed from the Government's table into the lap of the Opposition. I suspect that at all stages there has been a fairly cynical plot on the Government's part to provide an opportunity for a concession of this nature, because this is an omission in the original Bill which was almost unanimously condemned by virtually every pressure group which approached us. Nevertheless, we should be thankful for small mercies and accept the Minister's concession with whatever grace we can summon up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 90 rectifies an omission in the drafting of the clause. I say to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) that it is not always the poor wretched Ministers who are concerned. Now and then those who help every British Government have to tolerate the inadequacies of whoever is occupying both Front Benches. We must be fair to the Civil Service in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment rectifies an omission in the drafting of the clause by providing for a time limit within which the parent may express views on the terms in which the education authority proposes to record his child. The Government consider it desirable to avoid unnecessary delays in the assessment and recording procedure, which could easily become unduly protracted. If the parent is unable to agree the terms of recording, he should take his case to the appeal committee rather than engage in delaying tactics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The most significant word in this part of the Bill as drafted is "any" before "education" in subsection (3). I want to delete that word because, while it remains, the education authority is under no obligation whatsoever to provide any form Of education for the child before the child reaches school age, and I think that is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing is pointless. The subsection provides only that, if the authority provides any education at all, the quality of that education should be geared towards the special educational needs of the child. But the local authority can escape that obligation simply by providing no education whatsoever for the child before the child reaches school age. I am therefore strongly in favour of the education authority having a statutory responsibility to provide suitable education to cater for the child's needs as soon as that child has been identified as having special educational needs—in other words, as soon as the child has gone through the multi-disciplinary assessment process and it has been decided that the child should be recorded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Mr. JOHN HUNT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>10.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was addressing the previous Chairman before the interlude, so in order to refresh my memory and to give you the advantage of knowing what I am talking about, Mr. Hunt, perhaps I may begin again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 tabled would mean that subsection (3) on page 17 would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an education authority record a child or young person they shall thereafter ensure that education is provided by them for the child or young person including provision for his special educational needs before and after the child has attained school age; and the Secretary of State shall provide sufficient financial assistance to education authorities to enable them to fulfil their obligations under this subsection."</p></blockquote>
Before the Division in the House, I was saying that the Government are setting up a legislative framework for early identification of children with special educational needs and for early assessment of those children, including the multi-disciplinary assessment referred to in the Warnock report. But what is the point of all that assessment if the Government are not going to do something about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Former teachers, former pupils or anyone with anything to do with education know that its aim is not assessment. Assessment is a means towards an end in education. Surely if the Government are to have all this early assessment of the child—I do not quarrel with that—but stop there and make no provision for the child's educational needs after assessment, we are wasting our time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the word "any" before "education" in line 4 on page 17 of the Bill specifically means that there is no statutory obligation on the education authority to provide pre-school education for the child. The Government would do as well to delete the whole of subsection (3) because if it contains an obligation, it is there only when the education authority is providing
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
education. But if it chooses, the authority can refuse to provide any education before the child reaches school age. In other words, before the child reaches school age, the education authority can escape any statutory responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not see what subsection (3) means. If it is to make any sense, it must be toughened up by the sort of amendment that I have proposed. On a previous amendment, I mentioned some of the advantages of pre-school education for these children. Warnock says that there should be parental involvement in the child's education. I agree with that. But the Government should be particularly concerned about children who have been recorded before they go to school. I use the word "recorded" in its meaning in the Bill, but I hope that on Report the Government will change the terminology from "recorded" to "specially assessed" or some such term. That remains to be seen— we do not want to get bogged down in terminology at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should be making a far greater effort to encourage local authorities to provide for the educational needs of these children as soon as the needs have been identified. I referred earlier to the relatively small proportion of children receiving pre-school education in either nursery schools or nursery classes. I said that Warnock referred to the situation in Scotland, which is marginally better than in England and Wales, with education in Scotland available in nursery schools and nursery departments for 16.6 per cent, of children aged three and four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures, however, may be out of date, because they refer to September 1976. Perhaps the Minister, in all his wisdom, can tell us whether there has been any improvement, or otherwise, in that situation since September 1976. That is four and a half years ago. Have matters got better or worse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must query my hon Friend's use of the word "wisdom" in relation to the Minister. The hon Gentleman may be well informed, but that does not necessarily make him wise. When we listen to him we get information, but we do not get much wisdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an old Latin saying: "nescientia initium scientiae est", which means that ignorance is the beginning of wisdom. The Minister is at the very start of wisdom, because he has shown himself to be a very ignorant man in all that he has said tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warnock referred to that figure of 16.6 per cent., which, as I said, is probably out of date already. The Minister ought to give us the up-to-date figure. It is no use our sitting here quoting figures from September 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That 16.6 per cent, refers to the total child population. The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within these restricted numbers of children receiving nursery education the proportion of children with special needs appears to be very limited. In a survey of the provision for handicapped young children in the Grampian Region of Scotland, which was carried out for us by Dr Margaret Clark, 138 out of 2,441 children attending nursery schools and classes were considered to be handicapped (5.7%) compared with 63 out of 617 children (10.3%) in the sample of playgroups studied and 54 out of 321 children (16.8%) attending day nurseries. (The children in the day nurseries were normally admitted on account of some form of social deprivation.)"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
rather than mental or physical disability.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is other evidence to indicate that in some authorities at least children with disabilities are not receiving any preferential selection for nursery education."</p></blockquote>
That was a survey done for Warnock within one regional authority in Scotland—Grampian region. That region is untypical in many respects. For a start, it has the great disadvantage of being Tory controlled. With the exception of Aberdeen city, it is a rural area of Scotland. I wonder what the results would have been if the survey had been done in Strathclyde region, which is Labour controlled and contains areas of extreme multiple deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be making no attempt to get any up-to-date statistics for us on the number of handicapped children receiving pre-school education in Scotland. It appears to me that the best way to achieve the desirable objective of maximising the provision of nursery education for these children is to impose a statutory obligation on the education authority to make educational provision for the children as soon as they are recorded, whether the recording takes place after school age or before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warnock went on to recommend:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the provision of nursery education for all children should be substantially increased as soon as possible, since this would have the consequence that opportunities for nursery education for young children with special needs could be correspondingly extended."</p></blockquote>
Warnock fell short, therefore, of absolute statutory provision but certainly recommended that the provision of nursery education should be substantially increased as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Minister do to ensure that that aspect of Warnock is implemented? How much extra money will he give to the local education authorities by way of increased rate support grant under his provision for supplementary additions to the rate support grant orders which have already gone through Parliament? If the Bill is enacted I am sure that my hon Friends and I will give 100 per cent, support to a rate support grant (Scotland) supplementary order to make additional provision for children with special educational needs so that the additional responsibilities placed on local education authorities are met. That is why in amendment No. 113 I propose that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall provide sufficient financial assistance to education authorities to enable them to fulfil their obligations under this subsection."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) as it stands means very little. It may mean some additional obligation being put on the education authorities for children who are already of school age, but it does nothing for children before they reach school age. If we are to follow the spirit of the Warnock report the Minister should accept my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member might be better off listening to Opposition speeches instead of making sedentary interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is concerned with the financial underpinning of Warnock. I should like to examine some of the areas in which Warnock recommends the expenditure of funds or if it does not recommend such expenditure certainly suggest courses of [action that would require the expenditure of funds which I consider to be the purpose of the amendment. The amendment would enable the Minister to will the means by which Warnock could be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial part of the amendment is concerned with the special educational needs before the child has a chance to go to school. In that area, page 80 of the Warnock report relates to early educational opportunities and paragraph 5.28 states
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is evidence that for children with severe learning difficulties the years before six may be critical for their grasp of language. For all children with physical or sensory disabilities or showing signs of learning or behavioural difficulties, early education is the key to their individual development and the prevention or mitigation of later disturbances."</p></blockquote>
That is the starting point for the case for educational opportunities. Paragraph 5.30 of the report states that other compensatory measures may be provided by "nurture groups" which have been started in a number of primary schools for children approaching or over the age of five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is a transition into primary education which apparently has been successful in London where they have been tried out for children
	<br><blockquote><p>"who are socially and emotionally affected by severe deprivation in early childhood."</p></blockquote>
My hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire referred to a report of the research carried out by Dr. Margaret Clark in Grampian region which took account of the fact that something like 16.8 per cent, of the children in day nurseries in Grampian—by definition children are in day nurseries because there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
a measure of social deprivation in their backgrounds— were in need of special education. Therefore, there is some correlation between social deprivation and, in some instances, special educational needs and it is useful that we should identify one of the areas in which we have to recognise special educational needs as that of social deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, in the Strathclyde region which, in some areas meets all the critical indices of social and economic deprivation, there is a strong case, if we are to provide for special educational needs, to have financial provisions made in the earlier stages. As we said earlier, if the children are in need of special educational treatment, that need, by and large, is more pronounced in the early years. As the children develop it is important that they are given every assistance. There must be assistance not only from outwith the family, but within the home. Warnock says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore recommend that reinforcement and skilled support should be provided for the parents of children with disabilities or significant difficulties in the earliest years. When a child has a handicapping condition, many of the parents' instinctive reactions are distorted. When a child with, say, a sensory disability fails to respond in the normal way with smiles or gurgles, the parents may find that, without skilled held, they are unable to give the child the stimulus he needs. So the natural difficulties of responding to the child may be compounded by a sense of helplessness on the parents' part, with serious consequences for the child's development."</p></blockquote>
That type of emotional deprivation cannot be resolved by money alone, but it can be resolved by the advice which skilled professionals can give to parents. We think that the money should be made available to assist the parents at this time. That may save money in subsequent years, when the children have overcome their difficulties. Not all the problems confronting the young people are necessarily long-standing and they may be overcome with professional help and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warnock goes on to recommend that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a range of different forms of skilled support for parents of children with special needs should be available in every area."</p></blockquote>
We recognise that in Scotland there are nine regional authorities and three island authorities, and there are opportunities within that system of local government for a fairly comprehensive yet tight programme of assistance for the parents of those children. Warnock helpfully goes on to illustrate the various forms of assistance which are available. In most cases those forms involve expenditure and fall within the terms of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report first mentions home-visiting teachers. There are occasions when it may not be convenient for children to be taken to schools. It may be that in small towns there is not a large-enough community of children with special educational needs to warrant expenditure along the lines of a special unit within a school. If that is the case, a special unit would probably not be cost effective and, therefore, it would be preferable to have some system of home visiting teachers. Obviously, they would not visit every day, but only on certain days. Some research has been done in Wisconsin, in the United States, and I think that it would be helpful to call that in aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research was called the Portage Project and it was based on a large rural area of Wisconsin where materials and procedures have been developed which
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
enable visiting teachers to teach parents in their own homes. It is not simply a matter of teaching the children, but of assisting the parents so that they can help the pre-school children or those living in isolated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those cases, not all the individuals were professional teachers. That may be leading me out of order, Mr. Hunt, because if they are not professional teachers they may not require such high salaries as those whom we in Scotland would call registered teachers under the General Teaching Council. However, both the professional teachers and those with no professional qualifications received about one week's special training and work under close supervision. If there is a devolved system of education, it is essential to have a system close supervision—it could be called moderation in some circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the research programme:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They conduct a systematic programme of visits to plan with the parents a weekly scheme of directed activities, based on continuing assessment and evaluation of the child's progress. Children with all types of disability and disorder aged between birth and six years who are shown through careful screening to have serious developmental delays are accepted. Recorded results show that some 60 per cent, of the parents have been able to follow the programme adequately, and that significant gains have been made."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. We have been listening to the hon Gentleman's speech for some time. I strongly suspect that the hon Member is simply reading large chunks from the Warnock report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly not be in order if the hon Member proposed to read the whole of the Warnock report to us.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hunt, for that guidance. It was not my intention to read the whole of the report. To some hon Members who have not read the report, it may sound like the whole report. I am merely endeavouring to illustrate some points in relation to the provision of education for pre-school children, in a way which we have not yet had them illustrated. It is not my intention to be tedious or repetitious, which is why I am choosing examples that we have not yet considered in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Portage Project in Wisconsin because if we are to spend money—which is one of the requirements of the amendment if the special educational needs are to be satisfied—it must be on the basis of the provision of adequate funds. There are semi-rural and rural areas in Scotland that would not necessarily parallel the Wisconsin requirements, but could usefully be considered as possible recipients for a Portage Project-type approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not want to go on at great length, and I read only 10 or 12 lines of Warnock. I know that Warnock is not particularly sparkling prose, and perhaps my reading is not what it should be—although it ill behoves a teacher of mathematics like the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) to say whether someone reading
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
from a particular book is boring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Portage Project is the sort of project which could be applied to the Highland region and the more remote areas of Strathclyde and perhaps even the area that the hon Member for Argyll represents. I am not trying to hold up the proceedings. I am simply beginning to look at this matter seriously, because the opportunity has been afforded us and we have reason to believe that the sitting will be open-ended. We are therefore taking advantage of the opportunity to develop the case in a more relaxed manner than we could in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the opportunity in terms of geographical needs, because in Scotland we have areas of urban concentration and areas of population sparsity. I was drawing the attention of the Committee to the areas of population sparsity, and I was also drawing the Committee's attention to a project that seems to be eminently worthwhile and has been carried out in the United States with a considerable degree of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had had the opportunity, I intended to repeat, simply for the benefit of hon Members who had not heard because of the intervention on a bogus point of order, which you, Mr Hunt, correctly dealt with in your normal expeditious manner, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recorded results show that some 60 per cent, of the parents have been able to follow the programme adequately".</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly high success rate, which merits the investment of finance for the provision of education for youngsters of pre-school age in those areas. As I said, in the United States pre-school age is between birth and six years. Nevertheless the point has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other forms of peripatetic teaching services in operation. For the under-fives and under-sixes, I would regard peripatetic teaching as probably the most satisfactory. It has, in the main, been provided for children with sight disabilities. There has been home teaching for the blind. One can see the reason for that, because blind persons have difficulty in negotiating traffic and in using public transport, so we have to make special provisions for blind children whose parents cannot take them across busy cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an area in which there have only been—if I may use the expression—faltering steps. I hope that if the burden of Warnock and the amendment are to be accepted by the Committee, we would have the funding that would enable the facility to be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return briefly to the Portage Project, because Warnock stipulates some clear areas where they would recommend action. I am referring to 5.39 of page 83 of Warnock. It talks of peripatetic teachers who would be involved in a Portage-type project within the United Kingdom. It says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"We envisage that their job would be as follows:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) To assess children's educational needs on the basis of trained observation;"</p></blockquote>
That would, of course, run at variance with the multi-disciplinary procedures on which my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire previously enlightened the Committee. Nevertheless, we recognise that in special circumstances in areas of sparse population it would be useful to have this corps of trained observers who could go around assessing the needs of those young people. The second lady would have the responsibility to work with parents towards an educational programme for the child in the light of its assessed needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that peripatetic teachers would be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
to map out a course of educational instruction and would, I imagine, be able to provide the resources that would be needed—again, something requiring finances. That would come within the limits of amendment No. 113 and we hope that educational schemes of work would be provided. Certainly, I think that Conservative Members, who are invariably strong sympathisers of the Calvinist work ethic, would be sympathetic to the idea of educationalists laying down a clear programme of what the young people, with the assistance of their parents, would be able to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The peripatetic teachers would also have the responsibility to work directly with, and teach, the children on a regular basis. The business of teaching on a regular basis requires staffing, funding, and the sort of provisions contained in amendment No. 113.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (iv) of page 83 of Warnock refers to the need:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to maintain contact with other professionals in the various services concerned with meeting the needs of young children with disabilities to significant difficulties and their parents."</p></blockquote>
That area is fraught with difficulties. It is one in which there is considerable controversy in local government. There is a prejudice against the sending of individuals on what have been called "jaunts". My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), has been single-minded in his exposure of the profligacy of certain local authorities in Scotland in jaunting around the world. This does not fall into that category, because it is concerned with the provision of special educational needs, and we should be happy to back that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central will make the point that giving professionals the opportunity to meet colleagues nationally and internationally to discuss problems of common interest is a costly business. We realise that the fourth point is expensive, but it must be taken on board if uniform education facilities are to be provided throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party is often accused of being preoccupied with the central belt of Scotland, of being the party of the council house tenant and the urban industrial worker. We recognise that occasionally the electoral pattern of Scotland suggests that, but, in the absence of productive comment from Conservative Members, we must sometimes bring the needs of the rural community to the Committee's attention. Those needs in respect of the education of youngsters between the ages of 1 and 5 could be admirably provided for if a Portage-type project is implemented in Scotland. That would be admirably suited to those in the Highlands and the western isles of Orkney and Shetland, and possibly to children in such areas as Grampian, part of which the Minister represents. We would certainly not discount the fact that money should be spent on that worthwhile project in a way which would assist parents whose children are at a sensitive stage of their development.

The report also speaks of two additional functions that have not been performed by other professional people who are helping parents—namely, to encourage and to participate in meetings of groups of parents of young children with special needs. We appreciate that it would be difficult in rural areas, and that more money would have to be provided for travelling expenses. We

are greatly concerned that travel grants should be made available. We know that it is a sensitive matter in the present political climate, but the amendment would enable the necessary funds to be provided for such assistance.

The last aspect of the matter that Warnock examined was that of putting parents in touch with toy libraries and local pre-school play provision such as play groups, day nurseries, and so on. Another problem of living in rural areas is the lack of adequate shopping facilities and range of toys. It has become abundantly clear in recent years that there is a constructive educational value in play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an infant son of 14 months, and I have been made greatly conscious of the educational value of toys —and of their monetary value, too! I do not wish to catalogue the various types of toy, but there are many with a clear educational value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One toy is a ball containing various shapes. My children have had one for a long time; and it is certainly used by educational psychologists to test a child's ability to recognise shapes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I feel that we should adjourn now. The House, including its Scottish Members, sat late last night.

That is an important issue which concerns the Minister and others who are present. Members of this Committee should do their job properly on that Select Committee—I am the only Labour Member who is concerned, but four out of seven of the Conservative Members are on the Select Committee—and they will not be able to do so if we sit here throughout the night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it possible for you to give the Government the opportunity to declare their intention? We are willing to continue until we finish the amendments. That would be acceptable as long as we could begin on clause stand part on Thursday. But it is unfair and does no one any good merely to continue to waste time. I do not mind to whom the accusation is directed, but it seems absurd.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to finish. Child psychologists use objects which are used by parents in the house as toys. 1 described the sphere and the various shapes used with it. There was laughter from Government Members because I used the term "testing". However, such objects are used to test a child's spatial relationships—that is, the ability to recognise that one shape fits into a certain square, and so on. That is commonly used by child psychologists and equally is used by parents as a toy. That is also true of other objects which demonstrate and develop the child's ability to handle toys and various objects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful illustration of the educational value of toys. I have not derived much educational value from my son's toys, but I enjoyed playing with them. That is a further criterion and one which perhaps you had in mind, Mr. Hunt, when you pulled me up some time ago on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The types of provision which could be envisaged as meeting the needs of young people with special requirements are listed under 10 headings in the Warnock report. While the usual channels are doing their work, it will be useful to examine those categories to ascertain whether financial provision would assist the extension of those facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first category—
	<br><blockquote><p>"full-time education in an ordinary class with any necessary help and support"—</p></blockquote>
requires least financial assistance and may be the one which is the most attractive to Conservative Members. We recognise that "necessary help and support" may cover a variety of things—for example, extra staffing. Some Scottish local authorities have taken on educational auxiliaries who have been of much assistance to departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we increased the local authorities' staffing levels, and that brought groans of horror from Government Members. Nevertheless, "necessary help and support" could take the form of increased resources for books and materials or, indeed, of manpower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category is the:
	<br><blockquote><p>"education in an ordinary class with periods of withdrawal to a special class or unit or other supporting base".</p></blockquote>
That provision is already found in some parts of Scotland, but it is not as widely available as we would wish. More money would have to be spent to achieve the provision which we should like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third heading in the report is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"education in a special class or unit with periods of attendance at an ordinary class and full involvement in the general community life and extra-curricular activities of the ordinary school".</p></blockquote>
Young people in that category spend most of their educational lives in a special unit; however, they play in the playgrounds, eat in the dinner halls, attend the assemblies and participate in the chess clubs, film societies and so on of ordinary schools. That involves expenditure where it is necessary to have additional materials, and often to have a special unit constructed where the needs of a greater number of young people arc catered for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth heading is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"full-time education in a special class or unit with social contact with the main school".</p></blockquote>
That, in terms of integration, is the least satisfactory
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
but it affords the widest possible opportunities for the inclusion of children with more severe disabilities. It therefore probably requires the spending of even more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next heading is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"education in a special school, day or residential, with some shared lessons with a neighbouring ordinary school".</p></blockquote>
I should have stated, for the benefit of the 	<i>Official Report,</i> that I am quoting from page 96 on paragraph 6.11 of the Warnock Report. I realise that that may save billets-doux being exchanged outwith the usual channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heading I have just quoted is a little more difficult. I imagine that it would involve sharing, perhaps, PE facilities, use of the baths and some transportation. There would be the additional costs of running two separate institutions with heating and lighting, the problems of transport between the two institutions and so on. That would be a rather expensive way of dealing with the problem and would require even more money to be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next heading is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"full-time education in a residential special school with social contact with an ordinary school".</p></blockquote>
That, again, is probably even more expensive because one is running into staffing costs and extra meal costs, the provision of kitchen facilities, possibly 24 hours a day, with special diet facilities. If all those services were comprehensive enough, great expense would be involved, and once again that would fall within the ambit of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next recommendation is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"short-term education in hospitals or other establishments".</p></blockquote>
We know that there is the hospital visiting service and that teachers are available within the health service. Economies are of necessity being made in those services because of cuts in public expenditure. Once again, therefore, if we were to have funding that such provision would necessitate, amendment No. 113 would be brought to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ninth heading is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"long-term education in hospitals or other establishments".</p></blockquote>
I have some experience in my constituency of such provision, as it contains the Royal Scottish National hospital and Bellsdyke hospital at Larbert. They deal with the long-term care of the educationally subnormal. Perhaps one of the saddest sights of all is a ward full of the educationally subnormal, where the patients are for ever suspended in childhood at an age of 2 or 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The care and expense of looking after such poeple are almost incalculable. To mention them may almost be out of order in relation to the amendment, because there are all too many people who cannot yet be cared for in such hospitals. The devotion of the staff goes far above the call of duty, not to speak of the ability to keep the staff. One can only say that the expenditure on staffing should be far higher and that the wages of these people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of the severely educationally subnormal would be within the confines of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hunt. I accept your ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warnock gave one last category: home tuition. I referred to it earlier at some length in respect of the Portage Project for rural areas and I do not think that it would be helpful at this stage to discuss it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could talk again about integration and the financial implications, but that would be flogging a horse already well-flogged this evening. I hope that my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) will excuse my use of such a metaphor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to discuss briefly the other end of the scale. I have talked mostly this evening about the problems of the pre-school child. I want to talk now about the post-school child and the words on page 167 of the Warnock report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Preparation at school for the transition to adult life".</p></blockquote>
This is the upper end of the age range. Warnock recommended in paragraph 10.19 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"both ordinary and special schools should give pupils with special educational needs more help to acquire the basic skills and to develop social competence and vocational interests."</p></blockquote>
I know that in this age of Gradgrind education it is not fashionable to talk about social competence and vocational interests. We have spent many long and weary hours discussing the Government's examination fetishism. The Opposition consider that many of those young people who are not of an intelligence which can benefit from public examinations must be given positive assistance in the search for the basic social skills, and the development of social competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. So far as I am aware, vocational training and post-educational facilities are outside the scope both of the Bill and of the amendment. Therefore, 1 hope that the hon Gentleman will not pursue this line of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I was under the impression that paragraph 10.19 of the Warnock report recommended that in preparation for adult life the schools, both special and ordinary, should go out of their way to prepare the young people by constructing courses which will develop their social competence and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That may or may not be so, but we are not debating the Warnock report. We are debating the Bill and we must confine our remarks to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again I accept that, Mr. Hunt. I was going on to refer to the financial implications. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
amendment is the only means so far with which to deal in specific terms with the implications of implementing the spirit and thrust of Warnock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept your view, Mr. Hunt. It is your responsibility as Chairman to keep me within the bounds of order, and I take the point that perhaps the problems of transition into adult life are not, in your view, the prime consideration of special education schools. I have always thought that schools prepared children for life, but I should not now pursue that any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, however, make the point to which we referred earlier this evening—in your absence, Mr. Hunt—about the need for educational support when young people reach the age of 16 and wish to continue in full-time education. Here we are talking not about the educationally subnormal, but mainly about handicapped children who are very able. Financial support for the continuance of their education is not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had you been here, Mr. Hunt, you would have heard the Minister admit that there was no financial provision for mandatory grants. Warnock itself took account of that and said that there should not be mandatory grants, but that adequate financial support should be provided by local authorities. Only through the medium of amendment No. 113 can we see the opportunity to provide the financial support that young people with ability need to continue their education. The only means by which these youngsters over the age of 16 can get that financial support is by the acceptance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote Warnock once again, because 1 want to get it right. It is wrong to talk in a slipshod way about important matters, and it is therefore essential to place on record what Warnock said. The Minister referred to it in what I thought was an uncharacteristically ungenerous way, because we know that privately he is a kind man, although in public life he appears as mean and parsimonious as the rest of his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 10.105 Warnock states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that local education authorities should use their discretionary powers generously in making supplementary grants to students with disabilities who are receiving mandatory awards."</p></blockquote>
Information that has come to me suggests that there may be some clearing of the darkness. I am not sure when the clouds will lift and I do not want to appear frivolous about this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, we should have the money to do the things that we want to do with Warnock. The amendment is the cornerstone of the construction of our provision for young people with special educational needs, who everybody freely admits are not being adequately catered for. The amendment would provide an opportuntity hitherto unconsidered by legislative, executive and local government officials, by men and women who have devoted their lives to the care of others. It would transform the lives of many young people and the parents and teachers who are concerned in the care of those with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Committee. I hope that it will be unanimously accepted. I know that I have spoken for some time, but I could have gone on much longer. I stop now only in order to quit while I am ahead. To use an expression from the 1960s, I realise that good vibrations are in the air and that we may have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
the support of some Conservative hon Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the syrup of figs that is working through the usual channels is taking effect I shall say a few words on the amendment. It is an important amendment, which concerns the second, important part of Warnock. If we are to make genuine provision of education for those with special needs and learning difficulties we must organise the education system to cope with it and provide the finance to ensure that such organisation can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend's amendment attempts to ensure that that happens. It specifies that education shall be provided
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the child or young person including provision for his special educational needs before and after the child has attained school age",</p></blockquote>
and then insists that sufficient funds shall be provided for that purpose. The Warnock report sought to ensure that there would be adequate Government finance to carry out its recommendations and improve educational provision for those with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the amendment covers a wide area. My hon Friend has already mentioned the wide nature of the education provision needed from an early age— including toys, into which subject I shall not delve again—to enable children to develop skills such as hand-eye co-ordination, spatial relationships, and so on. Such provision is required over the whole spectrum, until children are past 16. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) is making strange noises. Lawyers seem to think that no one but they know any long words or has any understanding of terminology. They think that they are the only people who understand long words. Some of us know some long words—not many, and certainly not as many as the lawyers—but we like to air them occasionally so that people will think that we are more intelligent than we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn my attention to a matter frequently emphasised in Warnock—the fact that proper education provision for children with disabilities or learning difficulties depends on teachers being trained to do that particular job. Warnock makes it clear that the report cannot be put into practice simply by throwing children with difficulties into the existing school system and expecting teachers who have never had any training in special education and whose education in the psychology and development of children took place some time ago—often many years ago—to deal with those children. The philosophy of education has moved on since most teachers were trained. The amendment supports Warnock's contention that we must ensure that existing teachers in primary, secondary, and nursery schools are retrained through in-service courses by specialists in colleges of education in order that they may be able to take on the new task of teaching children with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is not in his place. I was attacked earlier for making references to him and for disputing what he said. When I had a word with him afterwards, I found that he tended to agree with my argument. He said that those children
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
would come into the schools, but would not actually go into classes with other children. That seems totally wrong to me. If they are to come into the schools, they must go into the same classes as other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Argyll seems to think that we are setting up special units within each school to handle those children with special problems rather than to integrate them into the school system. Every teacher in a school taking in children with special educational needs will require further training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we have all been watching the exchanges with great interest, but I have no more information than the hon Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Whips, or whatever name we like to use to refer to them—I know that they are sometimes referred to by less polite names—would come to some agreement. Teacher training is an area of some interest to me. I am quite happy to develop the argument about the need for specially trained teachers, but, equally, I am prepared to say something more on the subject when we come to the stand part debate. However, I should certainly like to say a few more words on the subject now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is winking and nodding and pulling all sorts of odd faces at me, but I have not yet worked out what all his expressions mean. I do not know whether I am supposed to sit down or to continue talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have specialist to carry out the educational provision that we suggest in the amendment, we must have in-service training for all the teachers who will have to cope with the new problem. Warnock lays down clearly what that should mean, but beyond that, and in some ways more importantly, all those who are at present in colleges of education or at universities and intend to become teachers, whatever their course, must have as an important element of their training— whether they be primary teachers doing their whole course in a college or whether they are doing a postgraduate course—the special educational needs element. If they do not have that element, the integration of those children into the normal educational system will be a disaster for the children. Certain teachers will be unable to cope with the situation because they do not have the training to deal with children who will create special problems in their classes and in their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone has been waiting for me to make this plug. If the Government are serious about the implementation of the Warnock report and the need to train teachers, it is a disgrace that they can be in the process of closing two colleges of education in Scotland that could provide —and already provide—some elements of this service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are genuinely concerned for children with these difficulties, and if they are to train teachers, they cannot close existing colleges of education. If they close down two colleges serving two large parts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
of Scotland, they will not be able to provide in-service training for the existing teachers in the area. Many of the teachers in the outlying areas of Lanarkshire and those in the central region of Scotland will not be able to travel to get the in-service training they need. I am delighted to support the amendment, particularly in relation to teacher training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to make a long speech, but I congratulate the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) on making what must have been the first 60-minute speech we have heard in the Committee. He struggled on while the official and unofficial channels tried to work something out. I hope that they have succeeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my intention to be churlish in my reply and pretend that the amendment is defective and needs to be redrafted, and I shall come to it in a moment. The hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) gave us one of his usual diatribes. I shall not follow him into the realms of the rates in Strathclyde, Lothian and Grampian, except to say that the latter authority— Tory-controlled, of course—is the one that sets a decent example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire spoke for a very long time, but Warnock deals basically with the 5-to-16 age group and a great deal of the hon Gentleman's hour's discourse had nothing to do with the 5-to-16 age group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is talking absolute nonsense. On page 336, the Warnock report identified

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the amendment, which the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire was meant to be speaking about and which deals entirely, basically, with children of normal school age.

I too have been, as the hon Gentleman knows very well, to Larbert, and I appreciate the human problems in that area that the hon Gentleman described very emotionally and correctly, although in something of a digression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. The Minister has suggested that the Warnock report was not concerned with pre-school education. I have looked at the terms of reference, which were written by no less a lady than the Prime Minister herself. The terms of reference of the committee, quoted on page 1 of the report, were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To review educational provision in England, Scotland and Wales for children and young people handicapped by disabilities of body or mind, taking account of the medical aspects of their needs, together with arrangements to prepare them for entry into employment; to consider the most effective use of resources for these purposes; and to make recommendations".</p></blockquote>
Those terms of reference make it quite clear that educational provision need not be delayed until the age of 5. Pre-school education is not discounted. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
what the Prime Minister herself wanted, and that is what she got.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get involved any further in this matter. We know what the Warnock report is about and what Mrs. Warnock and her committee discussed. I was merely talking about the difference in the power and the duty of an education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister must withdraw his erroneous statement that Warnock has nothing to do with children under 5. To attempt to get off the hook by saying that he meant the amendment has nothing to do with children under 5 is also an untruth, because it clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"including provision for his special educational needs before and after the child has attained school age".</p></blockquote>
The Minister cannot get away with that. He must withdraw his statement, which will appear in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will not withdraw that. We are dealing with the Bill and the amendments to it. It is easy for me to read out exactly the Warnock recommendations for children below and after school age. I am talking about the Bill and the amendments to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) referred to certain matters to which I shall come shortly. It will be interesting on clause stand part to hear his discourse on teacher training colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that I have made throughout this evening's debate. Opposition Members used no fewer than eight queer euphemisms when they were talking about spending taxpayers' or ratepayers' money. They used the following terms: "will the needs", "financial injection", "make funds available", "expense of money", "monetary support", "cash underpinning", "resource provision", and "provide finance". In other words, tax, tax, tax. All the time we have Labour Members talking about how they will spend money, but they say nothing about how they will raise it. That is always the weakness of their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment. As I said to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), I could churlishly find fault with the drafting, but I shall not do so. The Bill provides that an education authority may record a pre-school child, and where it provides such education it must provide for his special educational needs. I am sure that without the imposition of a duty to record pre-school children the amendment will have precisely the opposite effect from that intended. For example, where the provision of education for a very young child is not immediately necessary, an authority will simply decide not to record until a later date, desirable though it may be for it to have an early note of his needs. In those circumstances, 1 ask my hon Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reply is one of the most unsatisfactory and nonsensical that I have ever heard from any Minister, even in this rotten Government. The only reason why my hon Friends and I did not go into the depths of an alternative economic strategy on where the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
money would come from was out of respect for the Chairman, who would probably have ruled us out of order if we had gone into the transfer of expenditure from defence, the introduction of a wealth tax, more tax on bank profits, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this is an education Bill, but even within its terms we can transfer the necessary funds to the disadvantaged children with special needs by scrapping the £3£ million that is going to private fee-paying schools, which will continue by means of the assisted places scheme, and will probably be much more in future years. That money should go to the children who are far more deserving than are the privileged few in private fee-paying schools. The resources element in the amendment is extremely important, and it can be met within the financial measures of this legislation. We should, therefore, press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 17, line 36, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) It shall not be lawful for corporal punishment to be given to any recorded child in any type of school.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment appeared on the Amendment Paper with "not" omitted. That was a printer's error. Although it is only a three-letter word, it alters the sense of the amendment more than slightly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it a printer's error or a Freudian slip?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that those hon Gentlemen who voted against my amendment with regard to parental rights on corporal punishment this morning will see fit to vote for this modest amendment. We are considering children with special education needs, some physically handicapped, some mentally, and some with both handicaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that most teachers can be trusted not to use corporal punishment on such children. Nevertheless, we should blind ourselves to reality if we believed that that did not happen at all. There have been instances of corporal punishment being given to handicapped children. I can remember when I was at school that a physically handicapped boy was regularly belted by the teacher, despite the fact that he was partially paralysed right up one side of his body almost from birth. I do not know what damage it did to the boy, but it did emotional and psychological harm to others, judging from the expressions on the faces of those who had to
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
witness that almost daily ritual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that wee girls in the class who had done nothing wrong were made to witness that was completely unacceptable. If anyone thinks that such occurrences have been phased out, I have a statement from a mother in Glasgow, which I should like to quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A one-handed 11-year-old boy at my daughter's school was on two occasions given six strokes of the belt on his one good hand. Normally when children are belted, they rub their hands together to ease the pain but, of course, he wasn't able to do that. I complained to the 'guidance' teacher who had belted the child. He said: 'How dare you question my professional integrity!'."</p></blockquote>
I submit that that sort of incident, which may be very, very rare in our schools today, should be outlawed completely. That sort of behaviour is sick, obscene and absolutely unjustifiable on any educational or moral ground. Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to take up the Committee's time. I merely refer to the Special Standing Committee which was concerned with the English Education Bill. My hon Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) questioned the Minister of State, Department of Education and Science. He asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do not you feel that when a statement about a child has been made it would be inappropriate for anyone to use corporal punishment on that child?"</p></blockquote>
The expression "statement" is the English nomenclature for recording that we have in Scotland. Lady Young replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you are asking me for any personal opinion, I believe that the use of corporal punishment on handicapped children is wrong."—[	<i>Official Report, Special Standing Committee, Education Bill,</i> 19 February 1981; c. 45.]</p></blockquote>
But the Minister was not prepared to carry that forward and say whether she was prepared to have an amendment made to the English legislation, which is concerned with Warnock. She merely said that a corporal punishment provision was a matter she had not considered and that she would reflect upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That occurred during the first sitting of the Special Standing Committee on the Education Bill on 19 February 1981, which is nearly four weeks ago. I imagine that both the English and the Scottish Departments would wish to act in concert on these matters, as they have had plenty of opportunity to reflect on them during the past four weeks. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment as being a most satisfactory means of dealing with what is a very vexed question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that probably only on very rare occasions is corporal punishment used by teachers on children with special educational needs. However, having said that, the strains which are imposed on teachers by children with special educational needs are such on occasions that those teachers may be driven to the point where they seek to use the sanction of corporal punishment. I can appreciate that people under strain may resort to that type of sanction, but I feel that in a humane society there should be provisions whereby that option is not open. Such provisions are embodied in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would hope that, in the four weeks which have elapsed since the Minister with responsibility for education south of the border was confronted with that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
problem, perhaps the Ministers in the Scottish Office will have had the same opportunity for reflection, and that both will now give support to what we consider is a humane and civilising amendment. We do not believe that it will make a great impact on education, and I believe that my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) will agree that the dedicated teachers who work in this area on very rare occasions only, and even then in extremis, will resort to that sort of punishment. However, we feel that as a country we should legislate to make sure that nobody ever has the right to beat by any means a young person who requires special educational provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give my support to the amendment which the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) has brought before the Committee. It seems self-evident that it discloses a position that should have been covered some time ago by legislation. If there is no statutory provision to prevent handicapped children from being treated in that way, that protection should be offered to them under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that those events are so rare that it is hardly worth while legislating for them. But I believe that any incident of that sort is one too many. For instance, even if the Minister were to say that there were no such incidents to his knowledge, it would be worth while putting a provision of this kind on the statute book merely to take care of the possibility of such incidents occurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that if we allow handicapped children to be beaten we are distorting the aims and ideals of our society. It brutalises it to an extent that most people would find totally unacceptable. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment to provide that in future no teacher in Scotland will be able to administer corporal punishment to any handicapped child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of corporal punishment generally was considered earlier today under the provisions in clause 1 concerning the availability of information. A lengthy and serious debate took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the points made by the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) when he moved the amendment, as well as those of other hon Members who spoke in its support. I know that Labour Members do not like to be told that consideration is being given to these matters—that was revealed this morning—or that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is completing its report on corporal punishment, or that everything must be taken into account. But such facts must be considered not only in the context of corporal punishment but in the context of school management. As the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) knows, schools in Scotland are managed by local authorities which have to be consulted by the central Government before any edict on a matter such as this can be even considered, let alone issued, to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) knows, teachers and their unions are also anxious and make constant representations about the subject. Corporal punishment in schools is an issue that they want to be consulted about in view of their professional judgment and the job that they have to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
Therefore, the Government do not have the power to put into the Bill an edict about the abolition of corporal punishment in any category before consultation has been completed with school managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a real squirm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a squirm but a matter of fact. I know that the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has little time for facts. I would not describe him as having a precise mind. Nevertheless, consultations have now nearly ended. Progress has been made on the delicate subject of corporal punishment—including that for children with special educational needs—and I believe that it would be in everyone's best interests for agreement to be reached between the school managers, the local authorities, the teachers, through their representatives, and the Government who have an overall interest in education. We want an agreement to come about voluntarily, and I can assure the Committee that we are as anxious as anyone to see the question resolved. This Government have not wasted time or delayed the matter. But when an agreement can be reached, it will be reached voluntarily among the various parties concerned, and legislation will not be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also say to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire that the amendment is too general and pre-empts the conclusions or alternatives to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear from the Minister's remarks that we are on the brink of a concordat between local authorities, central Government and teaching organisations about the special question of corporal punishment for children with special educational needs. If that is so, may we ask the Minister to seek to expedite the consideration of the matter so that on Report we can see some concrete evidence of that agreement, such as a code of practice or a new clause enabling us to have confidence that the matter is being dealt with as quickly as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make clear that it is not in the Government's hands to lay down, on Report or anywhere else, the form of an agreement that is the subject of discussion between central Government, local authorities and teachers. I do not object to returning on Report to the question of corporal punishment, particularly for those with special educational needs, but it would be misleading to suggest that by that time we shall have the recommendations of COSLA and that an agreement with the teaching profession and other interested parties will have been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As matters stand, Opposition Members are free to urge the convention to expedite its consideration of those matters. The convention represents collectively the managers of the schools—including special schools —in Scotland. My information is that the convention hopes to submit its report to the Secretary of State by the end of the year. If that is too slow for Opposition Members, I suggest that they urge the convention to produce its conclusions more rapidly, but it is currently undertaking those studies and it would be incorrect for this or any other Committee to try to establish in

	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
legislation what the answer should be while discussions are taking place and when consultation is required on the scale that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can hardly believe my ears. If we have reached a stage where the Government cannot legislate to stop the corporal punishment of handicapped children—particularly in the International Year of Disabled People—I honestly do not know what Governments are in business for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is time that the hon Gentleman found out, because the local authorities are the managers of our education system and if he had to come to the House to learn that, he must have a great deal to learn about education, central Government, local government, corporal punishment and almost everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), who always tells us that he is a learner in every matter affecting the Committee, I repeat that the education authorities are the school managers and, as such, are responsible for discipline in schools. They are anxious to reach an agreement with the teaching profession about the future of corporal punishment, and they are particularly anxious to find an alternative. I think that most teachers would agree that it is not enough to abolish corporal punishment but it is important that a suitable alternative should be found. That is where the discussion takes place. That is where the difficulty lies and where consultation is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making out that I was not aware of the situation. He has explained it on previous occasions, and of course I am aware of it. I should like to learn from the Minister—because he is a learned person and I am here to learn—whether he has specific evidence that these bodies are discussing this important matter in relation to handicapped children. Are they concerned about corporal punishment that is being inflicted on handicapped children? If they are, it is even worse. It might be happening on even more occasions than those outlined for us by my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), horrific as they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The working party is considering the question of corporal punishment and trying to find an alternative that will allow teachers in the class to impose discipline on unruly children who cannot be put aside by a lecture from the teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon Gentleman must be aware, there are some children who need more than just a lecture from a teacher. What is exercising the minds of the working party is what alternative can replace corporal punishment. If the hon Gentleman, in his new-found wisdom, has any suggestions to make about what could replace corporal punishment, I am sure that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities will be delighted to hear from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are beginning to lose our sense of proportion. As we said earlier, this is not a big problem, because the number of teachers who use corporal punishment in this area is limited. The circumstances in
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
which they use it are also limited. The sanctions available are equally limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can imagine the problem of asking a badly behaved child to turn his wheel chair to the corner and look at the wall. There could be problems in asking a child who is educationally subnormal to write 200 lines of Shakespeare. There are problems, but they are not great. If the Minister had the guts to face the problem he could resolve it at a stroke, because the discussions that are going on between COSLA and the education unions are not bogged down on the problem of sanctions against handicapped children. If the Minister had any guts he would take an initiative and it would cause no ripples in the educational pond. He is creating obstacles that do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is looking for advice, and he needs it— we grant him that—because he does not seem to be getting any from the Education Department in the preparation of briefs on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon Gentleman to give his alternative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall make the point that I do not think that corporal punishment is necessary under any circumstances, or indeed desirable. 1 do not think that the Committee needs to consider other alternative violent sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had the time or the inclination to visit the schools and speak to the teachers he would find that, in the main, they do not use corporal punishment. If they do not need to use it, they should not be allowed to use it, and it should be struck from the record. That is the point that we are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition accept that corporal punishment is used against handicapped children on only a few occasions, but even those are too many and too frequent. If those who deal with handicapped children are not capable of handling them without recourse to corporal punishment, they should not be in their jobs. It is up to the education departments, the General Teaching Council and the local authorities to find out why they are employed if they need to have recourse to that form of punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position is indefensible. To put up these feeble-minded bureaucratic arguments in defence of their position is typical of their complacency and the basic indifference of the Minister to the needs of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon Gentleman again that the schools to which he refers are managed by the education authorities, which are the local authorities. They are the school managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hypocrisy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not hypocrisy; it is a fact. They are the school managers. They manage the schools and they are currently consulting the EIS, of which the hon Gentleman is probably a member, like his hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). The EIS has been constantly opposed to the abolition of corporal punishment without an alternative to replace it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in special schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The EIS is opposed to the abolition of corporal punishment until a suitable alternative is found to replace it. That is the position. The managers and teachers are in discussion, and this Committee can wait until they give their report, because no legislation will be required if proper agreement is reached between the local authorities and managers of the schools, which employ the teachers, and the teachers' representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could be clearer than that for the party that supports consultation at all levels, participation at all levels, and trade unions and managers talking together? What could be more reasonable than that the managers of the schools and the trade unions representing the teachers should sit down and reach agreement on a question of this kind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister provide us with one shred of evidence to suggest that the EIS is in favour at present of the continuance of corporal punishment in special schools for children with special educational needs? The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr Walker) is waving a piece of paper. I defy him to find in that piece of paper any reference to the EIS being prepared to support corporal punishment in special schools for children in need of special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I shall not make the points already made by my hon Friend, but I must say that the Minister's answer in terms of this matter having to do with consultations between teachers and the managers of schools, and management being in the hands of the local authorities, is the biggest cop-out that I have ever heard from a Minister since I have been in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was clause 1 of the Bill about if it was not about imposing a duty and responsibility upon the education authorities in terms of how to manage their schools? If the Minister can do it for clause 1, he can do it for this amendment. If he is talking about consultation and always proceeding by way of consultation, what on earth has he got in the Bill? Has he not got clauses in relation to new negotiating machinery for teachers on which there has not been one meeting between the Minister and the relevant trade unions? If he can cop-out on consultation in that area, on this important issue he can certainly do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government have imposed duties on education authorities and on other local authorities. They are quite happy to do that, but because it happens to suit his purpose tonight the Minister, on this amendment with its important moral implications, has taken this cop-out, and it is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Negotiations, particularly between management and employees, tend to get bogged down, and sometimes a new initiative from an outside body is required. That is why we sometimes refer trade disputes to ACAS—to get an outside independent viewpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS is demanding the right to discuss with its employers, the regional councils, the question whether corporal punishment should continue in schools. But the EIS is not discussing the matter as it touches upon special schools or children who suffer from a disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
We ask the Minister to clear the air and clear the lines. If he says tonight that it is the Government's intention that corporal punishment should not be used, as the amendment seeks, I am sure that the EIS and the regional councils would accept that without feeling that they had given up their negotiating positions on the question of ending corporal punishment in schools which are not special. That is what the Opposition are asking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the proposal, though we do not agree with it, and we tried to amend the Bill in that way this morning. We do not agree with corporal punishment in schools, but we recognise the unions' right to have those discussions with their employer. The two issues are linked. The discussion about the ending of corporal punishment generally must be seen in the context of the current negotiations. But on the subject that is covered by the amendment under discussion, the Government could take a decision which we are certain would be acceptable to the EIS, the other unions concerned and the education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clearly distinguishing between the two aspects. We lost the vote on the amendment this morning. We shall continue to pursue that point during later stages of the Bill and on Report. On this issue there is room for the Minister to state clearly with regard to special schools and children with disabilities that corporal punishment is not an acceptable form of punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with some interest to the rather heated exchange that has taken place. It is rather unfortunate that the emotive language used by those opposed to corporal punishment tends once again to bring the teaching profession into disrepute. I do not know whether hon Gentlemen intend to do that but that is the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I left the Room for a brief moment, I heard a story which related to some years ago when the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was at school. But I failed to hear either then or since I have returned to the Committee Room any evidence that the strap is used in special schools. I do not know whether it is used. I do not know whether my hon Friend the Minister has any evidence about that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon Gentleman heard the part of my speech which related to a statement from a mother whose daughter was at a school in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A special school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon Gentleman's point, but I think that a most unfortunate picture was painted or developed at some stage, if we were expected to conjure up the picture of a teacher taking out a strap to a child sitting in wheelchair. I find it very hard to believe that any member of the teaching profession in this day and age would do that.

The teachers have the difficult task of disciplining the children. It is not easy, and for hon Gentlemen to try to pretend that it is easy does not reflect what really happens in schools. Their ex-colleagues must wonder
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
what kind of dreamland they lived in when they were at school if they think that discipline in schools is easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the only way forward is for the teachers to be encouraged and helped to find ways via COSLA and the unions to phase the strap out. It would be resented if this House were to intervene and impose a solution on the people who have the difficult task of controlling unruly children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his considerable experience in teaching, will my hon Friend comment on the problem which is possibly more in my area of responsibility? We have heard so much today about the necessity for the integration of disadvantaged children into the normal education system. My hon Friend must know from his experience that we deal with cases of violent children. At what stage do we cross the barrier for control of violent children to what some hon Gentlemen call "corporal punishment"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that, apart from at second hand, I have had little experience of a child who was violent. One would have to control that child not by the use of a strap but by getting a colleague or two to pin him down until medical help arrived in those violent circumstances. That is very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, of all the children who attended Oban high school who had any disability, I never heard anyone suggest that they would use a strap with them. The teaching profession was very sympathetic towards the special problems of those children. Tt is the insinuation —a good deal more than an insinuation—that many teachers are virtually belt-happy and would strap even handicapped children that I deplore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the hon Member was not here for all of our speeches and he probably did not hear me intentionally make the point that we were dealing with a small number of punishments. That was one reason why I advocated an amendment to the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not seem to appreciate that, if there are children who are physically violent in a school, it would be difficult for a teacher to quell them for long enough to say "Stop. Put out your hand and accept the punishment of the belt". The belt is the last thing that would be used in such circumstances. We are not talking about such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what evidence the Minister has, and what the experience has been of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay—who seems to have spent his teaching career in a sleepy hollow in the Highlands—of difficult children who live in violent homes and whose only means of expressing themselves is by physical force, directed not only at their fellows but at their teachers. In most instances, the last sanction used by schools against such individuals is corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion. The hon Member has, by his last few remarks, proved that his amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astounded by the hypocrisy of the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) in his comments on corporal punishment and the handicapped. It is obvious that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
has no experience of a school where the handicapped are trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency—Aberdeenshire, East—I have a large school where the handicapped are trained daily. Moreover, my own brother for the last 20 years has been the headmaster of a school for the handicapped in Norfolk, where I have had experience of seeing how the training is carried out. To use the emotive phrase "corporal punishment", conjuring up in one's mind a poor person in a wheelchair being attacked by whip or lash, is the biggest load of rubbish that I have heard since I came to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the Opposition are trying to attract the attention of people outside the House in relation to the amendment. No one who has any responsibility for the handicapped at school gives them other than the greatest love and affection. I have witnessed that myself in the school in my constituency and in my brother's school. It does neither the Committee nor the Bill any good that Opposition hon Members should castigate teachers who in their daily duties offer that love and affection to those who by their misfortune are not natural in their living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Opposition should look at the other side, go to such a school and see how the children are attended to by those deeply loving and caring teachers. Seeing that the children have that kind of attention, they will want nothing to do with this emotive subject of corporal punishment and suggestion of the lash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply one of the most incredible, prevaricating replies that I have ever heard from him, and that is saying something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is after midnight, and the Minister may be getting tired. I warned earlier that that might happen if the Government tried to sit through the night. The Minister has made a statement that can be described only as yet another falsehood. I have already picked up his pal the Minister responsible for health for making a false statement. That will be in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow. If hon Members look in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow they will discover another falsehood told to the Committee by the Minister responsible for education. The gist of what he said is that the Government have no power to outlaw the use of corporal punishment for handicapped children. He then attempted to pass the buck to education authorities, trade unions and so on. When I see Tory Ministers trying to pass the buck to trade unions, I am immediately suspicious of their motives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth is simply that the EIS, probably the hon Gentleman's own trade union, is firmly opposed to the abolition of corporal punishment until a suitable alternative acceptable to them is found, and that the education authorities are charged with managing the schools. As I have said several times, it is for the school managers and the teaching profession, represented by their trade union negotiators, to try to resolve the problem of finding an alternative. If a suitable alternative is found, I am sure that both sides will be happy. However, the teachers want to be satisfied that if their right to use the belt is removed, which the vast majority of them would be happy to see, an adequate protection for them in performing their duties should be provided. That is what is taking the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unaware of any EIS policy in favour of retaining corporal punishment for handicapped children. If the Minister writes to Mr. John Pollock, the general secretary, and can produce evidence to back up his claim, I shall be interested to know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get the matter straight. The Committee has the right to make amendments of this nature to the Bill, and Parliament has the right to make the practice in question unlawful. The Government have the power either to support this amendment or to bring forward their own amendment later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman comment on a document that I have been reading—the EIS submission on the referral to the European Court of Human Rights? Paragraph 5.4 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish parents expect teachers to exercise a pastoral role and indeed, take it for granted that they do; and by implication they accept that teachers acting in this capacity as surrogate parents have the same common law right that parents have (and that only teachers and parents have) to use a reasonable measure of physical chastisement if necessary in disciplining the children in their care. The punishment they are allowed to inflict is limited to blows on the palm of the hand with a leather strap."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member is talking about corporal punishment in general. The amendment deals with the specific case of corporal punishment for handicapped children. Hon Members on the Government side have said that such punishment does not take place, despite the fact that some instances have been unearthed, and despite my account of one parent whose daughter was forced to witness corporal punishment being inflicted upon a handicapped boy with only one hand. I believe that such instances are probably very rare—although the Minister cannot even be bothered to collect the statistics, which shows his lack of interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon Gentlemen think that such corporal punishment does not go on, they have nothing to fear from voting for the amendment. They may argue that it is unnecessary, but my reply would be that if no corporal punishment is ever given to a handicapped child the amendment is harmless, so why should hon Gentlemen bother to vote against it? Therefore, I appeal over the Minister's head to his Back Benchers. They will receive no guidance from that unholy trinity of violent men on their Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) tried last year during the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill to give the courts the discretionary power to impose corporal punishment on convicted criminals. I do not know whether any other Conservative members of this Committee were also members of that Standing Committee. However, the hon Gentleman's amendment was defeated, so there must be some enlightenment, even in the Tory camp, on the issue of corporal punishment. If Conservative Members voted against administering corporal punishment on a convicted criminal—perhaps on someone who had committed a heinous crime—surely that should be extended to disabled children. If not, disabled children are being put at a disadvantage in comparison with convicted criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon Gentleman agree
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
that we are considering not corporal punishment for disabled children but chastisement being applied if they behave in an undisciplined manner? As I said, bearing in mind the love and affection given by the teachers, there is no question that they will apply a whip or a lash, or anything of that sort, to the children, but there may be a need for some chastisement to try to give them a sense of responsibility. That is what happens in schools for handicapped children, not corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman is referring to non-violent chastisement, why will he not vote for my amendment? There seems to be a strange reaction from Conservative Members. Either they say that the amendment is unnecessary because the practice does not go on, or that they do not believe that corporal punishment should be used on disabled children. Why on earth do they not vote for my amendment? The question before them is whether they want it to be made unlawful for handicapped children to be subjected to corporal punishment or whether they want to make that barbaric practice legal. If they claim any standard of civilisation, there is only one choice for them— namely, to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said this morning when replying to the hon Gentleman that his amendment was inadequate because it was too general. The issue must depend on a child's condition and the extent of disability. If a teacher in a special school—as we still call them—occasionally finds it necessary to inflict corporal punishment, the general nature of the amendment makes no distinctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement of principles and code of practice produced in 1968 by the liaison committee on educational matters specifically states that corporal punishment should not be inflicted on any pupil who suffers from any kind of physical or mental handicap or persistent and serious emotional handicap. In other words, the code of practice tried to distinguish between one kind of handicap and another as regards the use of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not hesitate in subscribing to that view, and I am sure that many of my hon Friends feel the same. The hon Gentlemen's amendment would ban corporal punishment in those schools, regardless of the circumstances. On clause 1, the hon Gentleman proposed a similar amendment to ban corporal punishment altogether. I have tried to explain more than once this evening why the hon Gentleman's amendment is totally unacceptable to the Committee, to COSLA and to the teachers' unions. That is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 82. I understand that No. 74 is not being moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 25, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) In cases where the report under subsection (1) above includes a recommendation that the child would benefit from school education after he ceases to be of school age and the parent of the child wishes the child to receive such school education, the education authority shall have a duty to provide it.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(9) The Secretary of State shall provide extra resources to education authorities to enable them to fulfil their duties under section 65(6) of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the need to cater for the post-school education of recorded young people. The Warnock report referred to the need to extend educational opportunities for handicapped youngsters beyond the statutory school-leaving age of 16. The amendment proposes to continue the statutory responsibility of local education authorities beyond the statutory school-leaving age in the case of recorded children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
The amendment refers specifically to the case of parents wishing their child to stay on at school. When the parent expresses a wish for the child either to continue at the school which he attends or to continue his education in a further education establishment, the education authority should have a duty to provide it. It is similar to previous amendments to which I have spoken referring to the need to extend the statutory responsibility at pre-school level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If youngsters have special needs and by the time they reach the age of 16 it is thought that they could benefit from continued education, the education authority should have that responsibility. But that again brings in the question of resources. We shall have the usual Treasury lecture from the Minister responsible for health and social security saying that he has no money in the kitty and that the Government are bankrupt. The Government may be bankrupt of ideas but, surely, it is not beyond their wit to try to get resources to make provision for these deserving children, either in existing education establishments or, if necessary, by constructing new educational establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears to me that Ministers often use falling birth rates and the resulting drop in the school population as an excuse for contracting the whole education system. They ought to be looking at the extra accommodation that may be released in certain education buildings to make provision for areas in which there is at present little, if any, provision. Surely, that is a top priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the statutory obligation that I am proposing could probably be met with little, if any, capital expenditure. It would probably mean more staffing, particularly specialist staffing in existing education establishments, but the Government allege that there is now a surplus of teachers—young teachers coming out of colleges of education, some of whom are getting little, if any, job opportunities. Some of them, who have the skills, could be trained or retrained in the specialist skills needed to look after the educational needs of these children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although by the new subsection (9) the amendment would place a duty upon the Secretary of State to provide extra resources, I do not imagine that those resources would be huge in comparison with some of the other things on which the Government are wasting public money, such as Trident, cruise missiles and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary, the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), will consider the amendment seriously and perhaps even consider giving us a concession in accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief while doing justice to the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who expects a reasonable, fair, calm, cool and collected reply on his amendment. I shall certainly not give him a list of all the financial provisions. In fact, I heard a minor sedentary remark from the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who is leading for the Opposition, that I should not go through the list again. Therefore, I shall include only the two new ones that have come in this time—extra resources and money in the kitty. My list now comprises 10. I shall build up this encyclopaedia of new names for rating the British people. The new ones tonight are extra resources and money in the kitty.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82 makes explicit the right of a handicapped child to continue school education after school-leaving age. This is already implicit in the general duty of education authorities to secure the provision of adequate and efficient education for their area as set out in the Education Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All children capable of benefiting from continued school education after they reach school-leaving age are entitled to such education if they desire it. This was recognised by the Warnock committee, but it was not perhaps as widely understood as it might have been. The amendment would add nothing to what is already in statute and ought not to be carried. I can give the assurance that, in giving guidance to what we have come to call the "pre-leaving assessment", we shall stress the right to continue education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of resources, I am sure that education authorities will continue to meet the needs of the over-16s who can benefit from continued attendance at school and will develop to the best of their ability, in association with the other agencies concerned, provision for those whose needs are best met elsewhere than at school. But we are long past the days of specific grants by means of which the Government determine and control the direction of local authority policies. Our view is that education authorities should be free to determine their own priorities in the light of their detailed knowledge of local circumstances and needs. On the past and present record, we are satisfied that the provision to which the amendment relates will not be neglected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the Minister say that the amendment added nothing to what is already in statute? In other words, will a young person of 16 or 17 years old who is handicapped to such an extent that in future he will be categorised as a recorded young person have the right in statute to stay on at school indefinitely?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their right to stay on at school, like the right of other children to stay on at school, is surely covered by the educational future, the facilities, the intention, the views, the parents, the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
There is no difference. Only two hours ago Opposition Members were talking about integration. Now the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) is talking about de-integration. Their rights are the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get this straight. Does the education authority at present have a statutory responsibility to cater for young people with special educational needs who are over the school-leaving age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the object of the remarks of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), they concern whether a young person who is disabled—now a recorded child, if I may call him that—can stay on at school after 16, 17, 18 or 19. I am not sure of the answer, but I should have thought that he came in the same group as any other young person. I know of some pupils of Oban high school, to name but one school, who managed to stay on considerably after their eighteenth birthday. Indeed, I can think of one who just about managed his twenty-first birthday at school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
