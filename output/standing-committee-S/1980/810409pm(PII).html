	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from col. 814]</p>
	<p>8.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is much more charming than his colleague, but, even so, his answer was unsatisfactory. It is not good enough, when we are talking about industrial relations matters, to say "That is what is in existing legislation, that is what is done now, so please let us carry on doing what we are doing". Since the previous legislation was drawn up, there have been changes both in the law—apart from this law—in industrial relations, and, more importantly, in the spirit in which we handle industrial relations these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would not be agreement if it were left to the two sides of the committee to come to a decision on what the arbitration should be, the matters in respect of which the committee should have arbitration, and how the settlement should be formulated. It is not impossible. I sat on a salary negotiating committee at its formation which did exactly that. We sat down—admittedly over a reasonably lengthy period—and settled the ways in which arbitration should be carried out. We decided that there had to be clear agreement that agreement could not be reached. Once that point was reached, it was up to the chairman to rule on the matter. If the chairman ruled that agreement could not be reached—he clearly did not do so until after lengthy negotiation—it went to arbitration. Which matters were put to arbitration was again settled by agreement—with difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that it is easy, but it is a better way of solving the problems of arbitration and thrashing them out than the method that the Minister suggests. Not only does such a method come to a conclusion that is at least agreeable to every person on each side in the machinery —the best agreement to reach is clearly that to which everyone on the committee agrees—but, if we examine what the Bill says, we see that the method that I suggest would take less time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Secretary of State cannot act until the machinery is set up, for he does not know exactly which bodies will be represented on the committee until he has set it up. That is what new section 97B(2) states. He cannot, therefore, start to consult about the arbitration procedure before then. When he does so, it is not with the two sides of the committee that he has to consult but with the various bodies that will make up the committees. That is a different matter from discussing the issue within the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time the Secretary of State had had meetings with each of the six different unions, the various local
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
authorities, the governing boards of colleges of education and the governing boards of central institutions, and has tried to reach a consensus of all of them as to the right approach, I am convinced that it would take him longer than the procedure outlined in my amendment. The amendment shows a better way of solving the problem, both because it is done by agreement, consultation and discussion and, because, in my view, it would be more efficient than the method that the Minister suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it insulting to people who are experienced negotiators—much more so than the Secretary of State, his Ministers or, with respect, his advisers—from local authorities and trade unions and who have spent a long time on the subject and know what they are talking about, for the Government to say that they are not capable of reaching agreement. Although it is not an easy task, it can be done, and I have seen it done. The Minister should reconsider the matter to see whether the method that I suggest might not be better, and not simply cry "This is the existing law and the better way of proceeding". Agreement should be reached in the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is so soon after our one-and-a-half-hour dinner break, I shall break my earlier promise not to speak twice to the same amendments. Another reason is that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has spoken twice to these amendments. 1 gave him a clear and definitive reply and explained why we rejected the amendment, although of course I do not expect him to agree with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only new speaker since then was the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr McKelvey), who is temporarily absent. He made two interesting points about a wider matter—namely, that of AC AS. He thought that we were running into a period of more arbitration. I have always felt that it is better for two sides in any joint venture to agree between themselves. When something goes to ACAS it means that there is a dispute and that the two sides cannot come together. In my view it is a pity that the matter has to go to ACAS at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that of course it is better for the two sides to reach agreement. But in the past few years many trade unions—including those of teachers—have been prepared to go through proper arbitration procedure rather than take industrial action, which is much less welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. But what the hon. Member for Kilmarnock said worried me—namely, that there would be a period of more arbitration and less negotiation. Meanwhile, to save the committee's time I ask the hon. Member for Cathcart to seek to withdraw his amendment; otherwise, 1 must ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to confess that I am in some difficulty, as not many of my hon. Friends are present. However, it is an important matter, and I must press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 46, line 9, after "arbiter", insert "or arbiters".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill says—but perhaps I am misinterpreting it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the award of an arbiter".</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that in many cases having a single arbiter is the way in which to handle an arbitration. The Minister has made great play of what is to be done under the existing arrangement. On the teachers' side the existing arrangement is that there will always be three arbiters: one approved by the management side, one approved by the teachers' side, and one independent arbiter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill reads, it would appear that there is to be one arbiter only. In my view, for a full discussion, and a proper balance, that is not sufficient. I am not saying that in some cases a single arbiter—wh'ch is why I did not take out the word "arbiter"—will not be right because there may be cases referred to arbitration of a minor nature, but important to small, individual groups, and a single arbiter might be the person to resolve them. But in the main arbitrations there ought to be more than one arbiter. Therefore, I propose that at least the clause should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"the award of an arbiter or arbiters",</p></blockquote>
in order that we may have the flexibility to allow the appointment of more than one arbiter to look at a particular dispute. That would go some way towards easing some of the trade unions' worries about the Secretary of State's plans for arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary. I accept that an arbitration might be taken by more than one arbiter, but we have covered that with the word "arbiter". There is precedence for this in section 5 (4) of the Employment Protection Act 1975.1 am sure that the hon. Member will agree that that was an excellent Act, with brilliant draftsmen and a first-class Bill team behind it. Therefore, there can be no mistake there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has said that the words "an arbiter" can mean more than one arbiter, 1 beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 254, in page 46, line 18, leave out from beginning to end of line 12 on page 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take amendment No. 264, in page 46, line 22, leave out from "and" to "accordingly" in line 39 and insert:
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Secretary of State informs the committee that he accepts the award, the committee shall give the effect to the award as provided in section 96(1).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>When the Secretary of State informs the committee that he does not accept the award and subsequently each House of Parliament resolves that national economic circumstances require that effect should not be given to the award he, after consultation with the committee in question, shall determine what changes (if any) in the remuneration of teaching staff as it then exists are not appropriate in the circumstances, and such determination shall have the effect as if it were a settlement formulated by the committee and sections 97A and 97D of this Act shall be construed accordingly.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crux of our argument on the whole question of arbitration, and one of the major complaints that teachers' unions have about the new clause, is that the Secretary of State appears to be having his final bite of the cherry. He first of all—set up the committee. He was a member of it, and he decided whether somebody should come off it or go on it. He then decided what the arbitration procedure would be, who the arbiters would be. Having done all that and been part of the negotiating machinery, he wants the power to overturn what the arbiter says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is scandalous. The Secretary of State is a party throughout the procedure. We are talking about the whole procedure by which the Secretary of State can overturn the arbiter's decision. What I am saying is that, even when the Secretary of State has been party to the management side's decision about what is and what is not offered, he can still object to the arbiter's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has been involved in negotiating machinery—I know that my hon. Friend the Minister for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will support me on this— knows that the Secretary of State's nominees are the most powerful members of the management side. They virtually decide what will and what will not be awarded. Thus, when negotiations have broken down, when the two sides—including the two nominees on the management side—have agreed to go to arbitration—and when an arbiter and his terms of reference have been decided, the Secretary of State can say that if he does not like the arbiter's decision he will overturn it. Yet the Secretary of State belongs to the management side that has agreed to go to arbitration. I accept that he will have to overturn the decision by order of the House, but I cannot accept that, having been through all that, he can still say "If I do not like it, I shall not accept it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trade union were to go to arbitration and then say that it would not abide by the decision, can you imagine, Mr. Hunt, the outcry from Conservative Members or the press? They would find it scandalous. 	<i>[Interruption].</i> I agree with an hon. Member who is saying that some unions do not abide by such decisions, but what do Conservative hon. Members say about that? They say that trade unions are not prepared to accept the correct procedure; yet that is also true of the Secretary of State. He wants to be involved in the negotiating machinery from the very beginning and he wants to have his say all the way through the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone will spend a great deal of time and effort on this lengthy procedure. It is hard work flogging hour after hour over minute figures and percentages, working out data and undertaking research. It is arduous, and many people will be tied up for a long time. But the Secretary of State can then say that the arbiter was wrong. He can also say what the award will be. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
think that that is acceptable in the context of proper negotiating machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill was presented by a Government that went to the country on the understanding that there would be a return to free collective bargaining in trade union negotiations. If this is free collective bargaining it is a joke, because one man can overturn decisions by saying that he does not accept the negotiating process that has been gone through, that he does not accept the free collective bargaining aspect either—even though he was a part of it—and that he will impose the award that he thinks is suitable. How can it be suggested that that is the way to conduct industrial relations? It is totally unacceptable to the unions, and I do not think that it is acceptable to management either—my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire may help me on that aspect —because management will see no reason for going through that procedure either merely to find that what it has done has been overturned, Therefore, the Government should look at the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that there are some circumstances in which a Secretary of State may have to have some powers, but that should arise only in a dire economic crisis that would require such draconian measures. The Secretary of State should take such powers only when an emergency occurs. They should not be part and parcel of the normal procedure established by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has understanding and experience of the negotiating machinery, in which he has played a part, that has enabled him to present extremely competently a series of important amendments. Many of those amendments have been fairly technical, so the rest of us have felt able to leave it to our hon. Friend to argue the case. There has been no need for substantial debate. In this case, however, the issue is so important that we should have a real debate about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend rightly surmised, the management side feels the same as the teachers. When the management and the teachers agree about an issue there must be something in it. My hon. Friend explained the position in Scotland that made the Secretary of State a kind of Pooh-bah—procurator fiscal, judge, jury, court of appeal, and everything else in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the scenario of a simple salary negotiation. The teachers' side puts in a claim based on an assessment of inflation, a reasoned estimate of what is needed to keep up with the cost of living. Then the management side, including the Secretary of State, makes an offer and there are negotiations. The negotiations may break down because of the difference between the claim and the offer, so an arbiter is necessary. In my experience, the Secretary of State's representative on the management side is the least likely to move towards the teachers' claim. He will say "This is all the money available, so this is the highest settlement that I shall allow to be financed"—although theoretically the local authorities have a degree of independence. An arbiter is then called in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to recall an occasion in my experience when three arbiters were appointed, presumably under the heading "an arbiter may be appointed". The arbiters were an independent chairman, one person nominated by the management side and one by the teachers. I recall that occasion only too well, because I
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
was not too happy about the person nominated by the teachers. I was the prospective candidate for South Ayrshire and my predecessor was the person nominated by the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When arbitration takes place those three people— presumably nominated because of their expertise—hear the evidence on both sides and come to a decision. I should like to ask the Under-Secretary to explain under what circumstances—I have been trying to think of them myself—he imagines the Secretary of State will step in to overturn the decision carefully arrived at by the arbitration body after looking at all the evidence and hearing both sides of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may step in because the arbitration procedure has produced an award higher than the management offer. The Secretary of State, as part of the management side, will not like that, so his representatives will not agree to it. If he uses his statutory powers merely to ensure that his will, which he did not manage to enforce through the negotiating procedure and could not convince the arbiters to follow, is done, that is despicable, disgraceful and an affront to all natural justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that the negotiations are a farce, a waste of time, and that people will not participate meaningfully. It means that arbitration is a waste of time and that arbiters might as well not bother to spend their time on it. I believe that those who acted on the last occasion gave their time voluntarily. They will not act in that way if they know that their decision, reached after careful consideration, if the Secretary of State does not like it he can step in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to think of other circumstances that might justify that and of what might constitute a reasonable reason for stepping in. With all the wise advice that he has received from his civil servants, can the Minister give the Committee a list of the categories of circumstances that are envisaged in which the Secretary of State will have to use those powers? The hon. Gentleman may be able to convince us. If he can, and if he can give reasons, no doubt my hon. Friends and I would want to consider them. However, I cannot imagine what they could be. I look forward with keen, eager anticipation to the catalogue of instances which the Under-Secretary of State will give us, and, in each case, the reason behind the Secretary of State having the power to step in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, was concerned when I considered the amendments. In the difficult area of negotiations in industrial relations I wondered whether it was clever to appoint an arbiter and to have a longstop in the event of his producing a finding which was unacceptable to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appeared that something was perhaps not very satisfactory. Then I thought about the matter further and realised that the Secretary of State would need to come to Parliament for approval of his decision and, therefore, that it would be exposed to all that would be required in public. If the Secretary of State had acted in a way that was not clever or very enlightened, a way which produced a reaction within the country so that people said that the Secretary of State was not acting in the best interests of education, I would think that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
would be uncomfortable in trying to get an order of that sort through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dealing now with a specific, single issue. We are dealing not with a question of overall policy but with one matter that has gone to arbitration. I know that Opposition Ministers like to tell us of their vast experience in these matters. If they have been to arbitration, as I have on many occasions, they will know that there is representation from both the trade union and employers' sides. I have been a director of personnel as well as a union negotiator at different times of my life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be circumstances in which the Secretary of State considered an award and said "We do not like that, because certain parts are not in the best interests of meeting education needs". That could happen in instances where there was a shortage of science teachers. Much play was made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) of the matter of free collective bargaining. As I understand that matter, supply and demand always come into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) shaking his head. I can only presume that he has not been involved in many instances of free collective bargaining. That would not surprise me, because most of the people who talk about it have never actually had to do it. It is a different matter when one is doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made the right comment. All the instances I have been involved in have been on the teachers' salary and conditions of service committee, where it is not free collective bargaining, for the reasons we outlined earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention speaks for itself. The hon. Gentleman said exactly what I expected him to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to follow the line that the hon. Member for Cathcart in pursuing on this issue, he commented on the question of free collective bargaining. He underlined it. He stressed it. It is important. Therefore it is just possible, in the circumstances, that the Secretary of State could say "We are short of science teachers. The award has been given for them as a result of arbitration. In my judgement it is not satisfactory and I shall amend it". That could happen, and I can think of institutions where it may happen. Therefore, I suggest that the amendment is not a good one and I shall certainly vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 264, which is somewhat more restrictive in its content. As my hon. Friend the Minister for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said, we are not talking about free collective bargaining here, because if the Government are both indirectly the employer and ultimately the paymaster, the free play of market forces does not come into the matter. The amendment is concerned not so much with that aspect but with the situation, which is now changing. Until now, it has been the responsibility of, or it has been incumbent upon, the Secretary of State, in the instances when he has sought to set aside arbitration awards, to come to the House of Commons to justify his decision. By the new procedure envisaged in the Bill, he will not have to come to the House of Commons to justify his

action, It will be the responsibility of hon Members to justify to him the need for change, or to maintain the arbitration award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am at a loss to know why that had to happen. If it is because the Secretary of State simply wants to do away with yet another parliamentary obstacle in his path, fair enough, let the Minister be candid and say so. If there is another reason which has escaped our attention, we shall be grateful to him for telling us. The purpose of amendment No. 264 is simple. It will require that the Minister comes to the House, as he does now, to justify the setting aside of an arbitration award, and that it is no incumbent on hon. Members to have to justify a case which has already been argued by the teachers, and in some instances the management side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State wants to have dirty work done, it is up to him to justify it. It is not up to the House to seek to defend the interests of people who have already had their say, and in many instances had that say agreed to by the people whom the Secretary of State himself appointed as arbiters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the views of both sides in this instance are clear. They do not like the procedure. They regard it as an affront to their integrity. If they enter into negotiations, albeit technically or in reality negotiations involved in free collective bargaining, in the end they are nevertheless entitled to be treated with respect by the Minister. For the Minister to come to the House and say "I want to ignore this arbitration award, and, what is more, I do not need to tell you why I want to ignore it. It is up to you to justify the views of the arbiter", is offensive to the House of Commons and to the people who do a difficult job both on the management and union sides. They enter into these negotiations in the best of good faith. That good faith has been treated with contempt by the Secretary of State. That is why we want our amendment to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two questions about this change from a positive to a negative procedure. I admit that I am a little at sea on the general subject, but I think that I have learned enough about the matter to begin to see exactly the distinction between the two procedures. In the first instance, I do not think that this power, which has been a positive resolution, has been used often, if at all, in the case of teachers. I do not know the answer to that, but we might find it out, At the present moment the Secretary of State has to come to the House of Commons and resolve positively that effect should not be given to the recommendations of the arbiter. I wonder how long he has in which to come to the House once he receives the arbiter's award, and actually make that resolution before the arbiter's award is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the Secretary of State could come to the House and table a statutory instrument which becomes effective unless either House annuls it by praying against it. I understand that the Secretary of State has 35 days in which to lay the order, so that four weeks could elapse before a decision was known either way. Even if the Secretary of State was going to accept the arbiter's award, he could wait for four weeks before he did so. Furthermore, even if my hon. Friend put down—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am slightly misreading the Bill, but is the hon. Gentleman correct?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
I am not sure that it could not run to 56 days instead of 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am open to correction on the subject, but I think that this is the procedure rather than the particular issue of the teachers' negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State laid an order which amended the arbiter's award, it would then have to lie on the Table of the House for 40 days before somebody could pray against it. Therefore, something like 11 weeks could elapse, if he amended the order, until the order was actually implemented—five weeks that could elapse during which the teachers would not know whether the Secretary of State had accepted the award. Then a further 40 days could elapse before my right hon. Friend could implement whatever amendment he had made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One imagines the situation in which a matter has gone to arbitration. To add on a further 11 weeks, even another five weeks, would cause great agitation. I suggest that the time could be cut a little so long as we have some type of guarantee that the Secretary of State, once he received the arbiter's award, would make clear one way or another within a few days what he intended to do. If he intends to accept the arbiter's award, within a few days he can say so and the procedure can be put into effect. If he does not accept the award, he can say that as well, laying his order and at least cutting down the 11 weeks in that unlikely event—and I gather from the shaking of heads that it has not actually happened. But if we have arbitration, which is the more likely event, which the Secretary of State accepts, I do not want to see five weeks elapsing before people know for sure that he has accepted an award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend to give some indication, in the framework of the new system of negative procedure needing a Prayer, that the Secretary of State would give a decision within a few days one way or another. Then, as in the past, accepting the arbitration, the employers would be able to get on and pay the teachers. If we did it another way and allowed delay, all that would happen would be that the teaching profession would become more frustrated. There would be more anger and more problems than there might be otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill goes through unchanged in respect of this provision, we shall be planting seeds of future trouble. I cannot understand why the whole process of arbitration is being affected in this way. I concede from the outset that pure arbitration in the education sector has not been known for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of arbitration, as I have always understood it, is that where there is a deadlock which cannot be solved by the parties, either to break that deadlock or to prevent industrial action, the problem is referred to neutral parties. Although the parties might be represented with one arbiter each, one out of the three would have the casting vote and be neutral, and the decision which came from that process of arbitration would then be final. This is usually the case in industrial and commercial organisations, and there is little point otherwise in having arbitration. Indeed, it would be far better to go through the process of conciliation. It would probably be more honest if the Secretary of State or the Minister were to abandon the proposals for arbitration
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
contained in the Bill. It is just a subterfuge to conceal the fact that the Secretary of State is the real party to the whole proceedings of pay negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would perhaps be more effective if the Secretary of State came into the negotiations right at the beginning and made it clear that he was the negotiating party, instead of the management side—whose hands are virtually tied and which is not able to negotiate properly because ultimately it cannot decide how much cash will be on the table. Indeed, the management side is probably placed in an impossible position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If arbitration were to proceed, it would be far better if the Secretary of State would agree to come into the process of arbitration, either by nominating an arbiter in the same way as the other parties or by having the ability to put evidence to the arbiters about the amount of money available, how it should best be distributed from the point of view of recruitment of teachers in certain areas, and so on. At the finish of the evidence stage, the Secretary of State's legal advisers would be able to sum up and submit to the arbiters the views of the Secretary of State himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The format which has been described by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), whereby the Secretary of State, while appearing not to be in at the proceedings is yet involved all the way through, surely does not hold water. It is as if the Secretary of State casts himself as the supreme autocrat of all the Scotias but is not prepared to accept responsibility for what he is doing. Even then, the terms of the Bill do not provide even the slight protection that was available before the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside some of the more general objections to the bastardised form of arbitration that has been in vogue before and will be continued under this Bill, it seems to me that the Minister can afford to make a concession in relation to the parliamentary procedures. I think that the Ministers—or his advisers, anyway— would accept that, where there is a substantial decision on revocation of an award of an arbiter, it would be necessary for the matter to be brought before the House. The negative procedure—the lodging of a Prayer— does not necessarily mean in technical terms that such a resolution would be brought before the House for decision. I ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be a better guarantee to members of the teaching profession—and, indeed, to the management side, which is often faced with an impossible situation—if the affirmative procedure were adopted, as it has been adopted before. What will the Minister lose? Does he really wish that the matter be not brought before the House because of the change to the negative procedure, or does he say right from the outset that this is such an important decision of principle and procedure that he would have to bring it before the House anyway? If he has to bring it before the House, he may as well keep the previous formula of having the Commons decide on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that technical ground, even if the Minister is not prepared to make any concessions over the improvement of the arbitration system or to go further and more radically to have a standing independent pay commission for the teaching profession, he should at least consider going back to the form that has worked for years, which has at least given some guarantee of security to the teaching profession, namely, the right of

	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
the Houses of Parliament to decide the issue democratically at the end of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the final point made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). I think that there are very strong arguments on constitutional grounds for never moving from the affirmative procedure to the negative procedure unless a very strong case is put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The affirmative procedure is a democratic safeguard; it means that there will be a debate and people can question the Executive's decision. As the hon Member pointed out, the negative procedure does not guarantee that. I have had experience—as, I am sure, have hon Members on both sides of the Committee—of trying to use the negative procedure to get an order discussed, and failing to do so. Usually the official Opposition must be fairly determined before a debate takes place under the negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that my hon Friend the Minister recognises that Back Benchers—whatever their political persuasion—should rightly be reluctant ever to allow a move from the affirmative resolution to the negative resolution procedure, unless the Government of the day put forward very good reasons for so doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been another interesting debate caused by the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr Maxton). Before I reply to him directly, I should like to take up some of the matters raised by other hon Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr Foulkes) said. I understand his arguments; they are perfectly relevant and reasonable from his point of view, but no doubt he will understand if I do not accept all of them. He mentioned the circumstances for overturning an arbiter's award, which I shall refer to later, and about different categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr Walker) referred to that problem and I shall explain the Secretary of State's position under current legislation. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said that it was an offence to the House. I hope that he means that Acts passed by both parties are such offences. My reply to my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr MacKay) is that to my knowledge what he suggested might happen has never happened, but it could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This point was not raised before, but I hope to tie it in with what the hon Member for Argyll (Mr MacKay) said. He quoted the time scales for operation. I think that he was a wee bit wrong; it was actually eight weeks in all, 21 days and then 35 days. The effect could be seen as a cooling-off period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of industrial relations is that, for every cooling-off period, there is just as likely to be a heating-up period. It is a dangerous weapon to use, as the Industrial Relations Act 1971 proved. The 40-day cooling-off period was tried and it was not very successful. Experience in America tends to be completely ambivalent on the matter. That could be one of the spin-offs; there is no good case to back up the period
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
of delay after the Secretary of State refuses to accept the arbiter's award. It could cause far more trouble than it would avoid. The Minister should remember that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does remember that and he was coming to that. My hon Friend the Member for Argyll mentioned the time taken to deal with overturning an arbitration award. The Secretary of State would move as quickly as possible. In the past, he has cleared arbitration awards within days and he will continue to act quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect—namely, the Secretary of State's statutory position if he were worried about the award. The maximum time is 35 days, since both the 21-day and 35-day periods are reckoned from the date of receiving intimation. I must tell the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire that that is when the Secretary of State decides to look into an overturn of arbitration. So far, that has been within days of accepting the award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) again raised the question of whether the Secretary of State should come into the post of arbitration, as he appears to be involved in everything from start to finish. I shall comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) raised an interesting point about the arguments on negative and affirmative procedure. I take his point, though the negative procedure still allows the matter to be discussed. However, I accept that the technicalities of getting parliamentary time are that much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Cathcart suggested that the Secretary of State should accept that, in view of his representation on a committee, he should be committed to accept the award. I cannot accept that view. It follows that, on recourse to arbitration, there would invariably arise a situation where an offer to which the Secretary of State was a party was not accepted. That would create a completely new situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment. Section 94 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 already involves statutory provision for dealing with an arbiter's award, including setting it aside. Whether hon Members opposite—or on this side for that matter—agree or disagree, we are dealing with the Acts that have been passed by Parliament, whichever Government were in power. Section 94(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any recommendations of the arbiters, on a reference under section 93 of this Act with respect to any matters considered by a committee shall be transmitted to the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
I need not go on reading page after page but, if we are starting to fiddle around with it here, we must go right back to the 1980 Act, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to explain the situation where the Secretary of State is involved, about which I was asked particularly by the Opposition. The situation could arise in which local authorities, or other employers of teachers, were faced with a pay settlement, following arbitration, which could not be accommodated without increases in rates or savings which unacceptably reduced standards of service. In that event, I consider that it would be essential that the Secretary of State should be able to set aside the arbiter's award and substitute one which local authorities or other em-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
ployers could meet. Additionally, the amendment would remove the power of the Secretary of State to deal with an award even by accepting it, and would leave the arbiter with a duty to intimate his award to the Secretary of State but with no concurrent power or duty on the Secretary of State to deal with the award in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have stated clearly that this has not happened. It is not expected that it will happen daily. But these powers and this overall responsibility must be given to the Secretary of State. As I said, I do not anticipate them being used, but he must be left with his powers because situations might arise in which he had to intervene. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make only one point. The Minister said "It is already in section 94 of the 1980 Act, so we cannot do anything about it". But the beginning of clause 14 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For sections 91 to 97 of the Principal Act there shall be substituted the following sections".</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are now taking out that part of the Act. The Minister must accept that it is he who is taking out those provisions. It is not the Opposition. If we cannot then amend what he is substituting, it seems a bit much. I am prepared to accept that amendment No. 254, may be a little too sweeping. I am prepared to seek to withdraw it if amendment No. 264 is then put to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I had understood it, amendment No. 264 is trying to replace what was being taken out of the 1980 Act so that, rather than fiddle around at this stage, we would be leaving the law where it had been for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that aside, I return to the point that was raised by me and the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart)—the affirmative procedure. The Minister said, in passing, that he accepted that point, but then did not say what effect that acceptance would have on the second amendment, which would give effect to the affirmative procedure adopted in previous Acts. I feel that that is an important matter of principle. I hope that, if he is in doubt, the Minister will at least agree to take the matter back for further consideration so that we may return to it on Report if necessary. That would be within the Minister's discretion. He would not be making an innovation or introducing an entirely new formula. The Committee would simply like him to retain the formula in the 1980 Act and other Acts. The affirmative procedure is the best way for an arbitration award to be broken—if such awards are to be broken at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the request that the first amendment be withdrawn, I should like us to vote on amendment No. 264 instead. That amendment was suggested to the Committee by the Educational Institute of Scotland. It did not come from the bowels of Walworth Road or any other such source.

Where such a committee has not yet been set up, there are existing negotiating committees that already decide whether certain people are teachers. Where there is no new committee, the existing committee should take the decisions. That amendment continues the theme that I appear to have been developing almost continuously since half-past 10 this morning —that the Secretary of State has too much power under the Bill. That power may already be there, but in Committee we have an opportunity to improve the Bill rather than to say "It was there before, so it would be nice to keep it".

Amendment No. 257 is a probing amendment. I have some understanding of how pensions and allowances and gratuities payable on retirement or death are determined. However, the Committee may require an explanation. I am sure that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) would like to know how the pension rights for his service as a teacher were arrived at and which committee made the decision. He may have thought that such rights were established by the salaries committee. I know that is not so, but I do not believe that enough people know how pension rights are established. The Minister should explain to the Committee.

Secondly, in regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"compensation for loss of office or employment or for loss or diminution",</p></blockquote>
I would like to know who is to negotiate that and how it is to be negotiated. I went through a long procedure of negotiating for people in those circumstances. That is not covered by the committee that covers paragraph (i) on pensions. I hope that the Minister can explain how, if there is to be redundancy, the redundancy terms are to be negotiated.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the last two amendments on clause 14.

I am sure that in doing so he had only the best interests of Scottish education at heart. I have not been able to accept many of the amendments, for reasons that I hope he will appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle I have some sympathy with the proposition that the Committee might determine what persons were to be regarded as teaching staff. It would be inappropriate for existing negotiating bodies to decide this matter, and so bind the committee in advance of its creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, it would be impractical for anybody, other than the Secretary of State, to determine this matter. The Secretary of State would, of course, be strongly influenced in determining the meaning of the term "teaching staff" by the committee or, if necessary, by the bodies that are likely to be represented on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 257 is unnecessary. The new committees will not be set up until the relevant legislation is brought into force under the provisions of clause 21. New section 97D makes adequate transitional provisions, so that there should be no possibility of a hiatus in negotiations. I hope, however, that the new committees can be set up in time for the 1982 pay round.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very full debate on the amendments. I hope, therefore, that the debate on clause stand part will be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am disappointed—not by the debate, because, due to the initiative of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), we have had a good debate on many topics—because this is not an issue of party policy. It is not like the assisted-places scheme or the freedom of choice debate on which Conservative Members will stick to their guns. This is a technical debate in which some good suggestions can come from both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found two things disappointing. First, when Tory Back Benchers but forward sensible ideas, they do not pusue them if they are not accepted by the Minister. That is a disturbing trend. I have been here for only a short time. However, I am disappointed to see it happen on matters that do not involve party issues. In particular, few Scottish Conservative Members have the guts to say that they think their Government are wrong on any particular issue. If the issue is not one of principle or of party politics, they should be able to say that they think they are right, that they have put forward a good point, as have the Opposition, and that they will therefore support the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen that happen on United Kingdom Bills, and it is very impressive. I do not know what it is about English Conservative Members—perhaps it is the warmer climate—but if they feel strongly enough about a topic—for example telephone tapping—they will vote with the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second disappointment is related to the first— namely the reluctance of both Ministers to reconsider anything. One begins to wonder who controls education in Scotland. Is it the Secretary of State and his Under-Secretaries or is it, as many of us have believed for a long time, the Scottish Education Department? Perhaps that Department is in total control and gives the Ministers their instructions rather than the other way round. That is what seems to be coming through. The Ministers have not taken the initiative on technical matters. Clearly, they have not said, as they did on the assisted-places scheme, "Draw up some legal arrangements under which to implement the scheme".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is plain that, with regard to the committees on salaries and conditions of service, the officials have put forward various schemes after holding discussions. Yet, the Ministers do not appear to have the confidence, knowledge and understanding to be able to say "That is a good point. We shall consider it and see what we can do about it". The frustrations, irritability, annoyance and disillusionment that can be seen on the Opposition side of the Committee will be reflected outside. However, I hope that that will change at some point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that change has been long overdue with regard to the negotiating committees. As I said earlier, I did not slavishly support the remarks of the majority of my hon Friends. I agreed with the merging of these two committees, and said so. However, although change is long overdue and although we have now got some of the things that I wanted, I am not sure that we have ended up with a good system for negotiating salaries and conditions of service.

	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
still see many of the problems that we had with the salaries committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem of the Secretary of State. I remember meeting after meeting where good old J. B. Hume—he has been moved to safer pastures— Mr. Smith and all the others came along as the Secretary of State's representatives. They scurried back time after time to St. Andrew's House to get their instructions and further guidance and clarification. The Secretary of State was always there with a real veto, an effective veto or whatever. The negotiations were to some extent meaningless and to some extent a fraud and a facade. Certainly the negotiating committee could work out the details of the distribution of salary awards and say that so much should be allocated to such-and-such a category or that the distribution might be a little different, but almost no discretion, if any, has been allowed to the management side on the total amount of the award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was typical of the Minister's hon Friend not to have the courtesy to comment on the letter from the EIS. I know that the EIS has given a great deal of consideration to a standing commission on teachers' pay. It has put forward specific proposals to the Secretary of State and his Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not always too keen to accept the guidance of civil servants. That fact is probably well known by now. But the information I have is that the EIS has put forward these proposals. They need more work done on them, but they are an indication that the major teachers' union is advancing proposals for the way in which salaries and conditions of service should be discussed and negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) would agree that it is strange that we are plodding through line after line, paragraph after paragraph, of the product of discussions and consultations five years ago. Events in the real world outside these hallowed walls have moved further forward since then. I cannot speak for the Opposition. I do not say that the Opposition accept the standing commission concept. I agree that it needs further discussion. But it must throw some doubt into the minds of Ministers that the legislation they are enacting is not necessarily the right solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the subtle hint of the hon Member for Argyll, who has been in a much more generous and benign mood today than he has been on previous occasions this week, and draw my remarks to a close. We have spent much time and energy going through the proposals. I fear that what will come out of our discussions will be the sort of thing we hear about when a Committee sits down and tries to design a horse and ends up with a camel. I think that we have a strange creature so far as our negotiating procedures are concerned. I do not believe that we have discussed some of the major issues involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause, because it concerns the negotiating structure for the wages and working conditions of the most valuable resource in education—the teacher. I say that not because I was a former teacher. I know that there are hon Members on both sides of the Committee who can claim to have had the same experience. But in recent years, certainly, teachers in Scotland have had legitimate grievances, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
they have looked towards Parliament on several occasions to try to solve those grievances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always maintained that the best way to conduct negotiations is in free collective bargaining. Yet what we have now is a system which will mean the negotiations taking place in a financial straitjacket. The Government will exercise financial constraint on the employers' side of the negotiating committee. The Government will also be approving the members of the employers' team on the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last year we saw the utter chaos in Scottish education which resulted from the provocation, deliberate or otherwise, of Government policy. In consequence, there was industrial unrest in schools throughout Scotland. I have every sympathy with the teaching profession because teachers must have felt very frustrated at being offered a mere 13 per cent, initially and then a miserly increase to 14 per cent, at a time when inflation was well over 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this year they have been given 7 per cent., a rate still well below the current rate of inflation. The Government have said that their target is to bring inflation down to single figures, but they are still far short of their target and inflation is still well above the rate which they inherited from the Labour Government. Added to hyper-inflation, we have massive cutbacks in education expenditure and the rate-support grant to local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is going very wide of the clause, which is about the remuneration of teachers. I hope that he will confine his remarks to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As well as the financial restraints there are the veto powers for the Secretary of State in the clause, as I am sure you will have noticed, Mr. Hunt. Even when an award goes to arbitration and the arbiter decides on a certain percentage, the Secretary of State, in his wisdom or otherwise, will be able to veto that award. I think that that is a very unfair system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate some valid points have been put across, even by Conservative Members. Unfortunately, they have not backed up their voices with their votes, and after the disgraceful performance of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) I believe that the SSTA general secretary, Mr. James Docherty, will probably be looking for a new adviser, because the hon Gentleman has voted against the SSTA policy time after time tonight. After speaking in favour of it he has voted against it, which shows a distinct lack of political courage. However, political courage is not exactly an attribute we expect to find in Tory Members who represent Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad thing is that in dealing with the clause we have seen the Scottish Tory Party display an anti-teacher attitude. I shall certainly tell the teachers' unions and the whole teaching profession about the disgraceful behaviour of the Scottish Tory Members in the Committee unless they now have the guts to join us in voting against the clause. The clause will do nothing to set up a fair negotiating machinery which will help to get a fair deal for the hard-working and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
hard-pressed teachers who are victims, just like the children they are trying to teach, of the failure of the Government's economic policy and disastrous education policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be quite wrong to allow the clause to go by without a comment, even if it does upset my hon Friend on the Front Bench. I have been saddened by the content of many of the speeches made from the Opposition Benches. If we are to believe what has been said by Opposition spokesmen—anyone who cares to read the 	<i>Official Report</i> will recognise the fact— teachers have moved a long way from the days when teachers in Scotland were proud to be considered as professionals, and behaved as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the debate on the clause, all we have heard has been about trade unions, free collective bargaining and industrial relations. That theme has permeated most of the speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened to produce that situation? It has been brought about by the behaviour of a few teachers in recent years and by the emergence of a more militant attitude on the part of a few activists who have used industrial action—action which would have been more in keeping with manufacturing industrial militancy than with the profession of teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, that is not a good road for the teachers to travel. I hope that the dedicated professional teachers of Scotland, who are the majority, will have noted the content of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my judgment—I repeat a warning that I gave some time ago—that pressure will grow to introduce conditions for terminating employment similar to those that exist in the non-public sector and in some areas of non-professional public employment. That can only be sad for teachers and children in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The content of the remarks of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is none the less empty for the fact that they were delivered in a pompous manner. In the last two years, we have come to know the sort of stuff that we can expect from him. I am surprised that the hon Gentleman made his speech tonight, because no one is here from the press. They would have been the only people interested in it. Only the yellow press of Dundee, at best, would be prepared to print such silly nonsense. But the gross slanders of the teaching profession by the hon Member are probably best ignored. They will not help to improve industrial relations in the education service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the members of the Committee care to read the editorials of the Dundee 	<i>Courier,</i> they will see that even that paper is now dissociating itself from remarks such as have been made by the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). I am certain that members of the Committee will dissociate themselves from his comments, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon Friend's information. The Dundee 	<i>Courier</i> has been regarded by some as beyond the pale. The degree of political and social leprosy from which the hon Gentleman seems to
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
be suffering must have reached such proportions as to make his remarks unacceptable even to that paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to talk about what, to all intents and purposes, is the Bill's lost opportunity regarding negotiations about wages, salaries and conditions. Most of us on these Benches have misgivings about the combination of the two committees on salaries and service. Many of us have sympathy with the concept but are disturbed at the time at which the committees are being joined together. We take the view that, in the difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is dangerous for trade unions to be placed in a position where they may be taken advantage of by the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot kid ourselves that the trade unions in the public sector are not now in a weak position because of the high unemployment, the attitude of the Government to public expenditure and their application of cash limits, and because the Government have whipped up a campaign of hate against public servants and seek to convey to the public at large that those individuals are leeches on the backs of the rest of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us feel that the Government's attitude towards the public sector—not least towards teachers— will sour industrial relations in the years ahead. We think that the souring of the atmosphere will prevent acceptance by the bulk of teachers of the proposals that have been somewhat hesitantly put forward by the EIS in respect of standing commissions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government were groping their way towards comparability as a means of resolving wages disputes in the public sector, and it is fair to say that the EIS proposal goes some way towards resurrecting the concept of comparability. The only problem is that this suggestion will fall on deaf ears in the Government. During the last 10 days there have been innumerable lobbies at the House. Last Thursday we were lobbied by the Fire Brigades Union. The firemen belong to one of those groups of public service workers who, admittedly after a period of industrial dispute with the previous Government, arrived at an arrangement whereby they would be almost locked into a comparability arrangement under which their wages would be increased to meet what I think was the uppermost quartile of a certain group of manual workers. This meant that they would be taken out of free collective bargaining on their wages. In effect, it meant that they would not be left to the vagaries of the market system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other groups of public sector workers have had their rises, not necessarily guaranteed, but reviewed by bodies such as the Pay Research Unit, which was responsible for Civil Service salaries. It might have been possible, in a more generous climate, for school teachers, for instance, to be considered in this way, but at present there is no possibility of that being done now and they are being subjected to wages, salaries and negotiating arrangements that are totally unacceptable to the individuals concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we conclude the clause stand part debate I should perhaps deal briefly with what will happen now. Salaries and conditions are to be dealt with by the one committee, whose membership will be drawn from groups which the Secretary of State will invite to participate. If these groups form a particular pattern, they will need the approval of the Secretary of State for the committee's composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will then have to discuss wages, the global sum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
of which will have been determined by the Secretary of State in advance, and conditions, which will have to be in keeping with what the Secretary of State regards as acceptable. In the event of disagreement, the Secretary of State will have the right to refer to an arbiter. If individuals on the committee disagree, again the Secretary of State can refer an award to an arbiter. Even if reference has been made and arbitration takes place, it is still open to the Secretary of State to set it aside and to do so in such a leisurely manner that it can be regarded only as a recipe for future industrial unrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that issues such as redundancy, and certain aspects of pensions which could legitimately be included for consideration by this body, have been ignored. We regard this as a lost opportunity. It was put to me by teachers that there were several other matters that they would have been prepared to discuss, and the exclusions are a source of disappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall vote against the clause, although we realise that there is a salaries and conditions element. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes), who has a long-standing commitment to the matter, has some misgivings on that score, but I am sure that he takes the view that the small gain is far outweighed by the prospect of the long-term unrest that the proposals in the clause will create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are concerned to have an education service that will operate smoothly and be free from industrial strife and bitterness, we must change the Secretary of State's attitude to education. At present we see no likelihood of that happening. The only way in which there will be industrial peace in education is for the Government's policy of creating more unemployment to continue, which will mean that working people— in this instance teachers—will be forced to the negotiating table, frightened out of their minds by the threat of losing their jobs. That is the industrial relations policy of the nineteenth century, which we had hoped had been put behind us long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the clause, which replace the provisions of sections 91 to 97 of the 1980 Act, are a recipe for industrial disaster. They will cause mayhem in the teaching profession. If that does not happen, it will not be through the Secretary of State's conciliatory powers, but only because of the economically disastrous Government policies, which will break the back of the trade union movement. Working people will be dissuaded from taking any form of industrial action to improve their conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make only a small contribution to the debate, which has highlighted the difference in the roles of members of the Committee. We can discount the remarks of the Neanderthal Man, the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). No one pays much attention to what he says. All that we are concerned about is the damage that he is doing to Dundee. When the Dundee 	<i>Courier</i> joins the Tayside chamber of commerce in condemning the hon Gentleman, it is time for his local party to consider his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition wish to remind Conservative Members of the freedoms that they proclaimed during the election campaign. They made great play of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
removal of Government interference in the day-to-day running of public sector industry, but in a succession of Bills they are curtailing—indeed, ending—local democracy as we know it in regional and district councils. The Bill begins to eat into existing conditions —not privileges—that teachers have secured over many years, and which they are rightly seeking to protect and maintain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to suggest reasonable and meaningful ways of making changes in the existing negotiating machinery, if the Committee feels that that is necessary. Even within the Opposition there have been differences of opinion on this issue. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) did not agree with all the amendments put forward by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Nevertheless, we were seeking to introduce peace and harmony, to inspire some confidence in the education system and confidence on the part of those in the education profession that they will continue to have the support of the House in the serious job that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right for the teachers' unions to try to maintain the existing conditions. If we reduce the number of the negotiating committees from five to two, there should be some factor to offset that. Surely that should mean more freedom, not more restrictions. I have made it clear that I do not profess to have any detailed knowledge of the education system, but I have negotiated in the private sector of the economy for many years. There it was accepted that there would always be compromise at the end of the day. We had to accept that we and the employers did not exactly see eye to eye about our claims. "Compromise" was always the word that we used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we have tabled have been designed to suggest a form of compromise that will go at least some way towards reassuring teachers that we are not trying to remove all democracy from the negotiating procedure and replace it with the threat that the Secretary of State may at any time impose a decision that he alone considers necessary with regard to wages, conditions, staffing levels or the decisions of the arbitration body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State decides to use the powers that he is taking, that will be a recipe for disaster in Scottish education. That recipe is contained in the clause. If the Secretary of State does not think again and come forward with a compromise on Report, we can only say that when disaster befalls the right hon Gentleman we shall be on the teachers' side, and we shall say that our words in this Committee have been proved correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry that my remarks will have to be somewhat truncated. [Hon Members: "Why?"] Because the debate has lasted for much longer than I expected. We have ranged fairly widely in debating the clause. I shall be as brief as possible and answer a certain number of the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) said that he was a fairly new Member, and he talked about Conservative hon Members not speaking, not voting according to their consciences and so on. I was in Opposition in the previous Parliament, and I assure the hon Gentleman that there was virtually no difference between the behaviour that he describes and that of Labour hon Members in Government. They were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
craven and cowardly and never voted against their party. Let us put that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot give way now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some lads from Oxford university or one of the redbrick places in England who did some research recently said that I had voted against the previous Labour Government more times than had any other hon Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all voted against our party from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) made his usual vigorous speech. Let me take up one point made by the hon Member for South Ayrshire. I note the suggestion that teachers' salaries may be fixed by an independent standing commission, but I do not see that as an improvement on the Bill. The criticisms of the machinery proposed in the Bill—and of the existing machinery— really come down to the argument that limitations on resources make entirely free pay negotiations impossible. Additional resources would not become available because teachers' pay was fixed by a standing commission and we are not prepared to give an open-ended undertaking, on behalf of the Government and teachers' employers, to underwrite any pay increase which a commission might award. Employers will have to weigh the merits of pay claims against their other commitments, and in the light of the resources available to them. I think it preferable that they should conduct their own negotiations. The EIS has suggested negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard another interesting speech from my hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who has borne a heavy load throughout the passage of the Bill, made his usual useful contribution. Though I cannot say that I necessarily agreed with him, I am always pleased to hear what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also had a final contribution from the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), but I was getting so worried about the clock that I did not hear anything that he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might clear up one matter—a minor
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
domestic difficulty—that cropped up this morning. I wish to clarify the position regarding orders made by my right hon Friend about the maximum number of representatives on committees. There was some confusion about this. The position is that the provisions enable the Secretary of State to prescribe by order the maximum number of representatives on each committee. The Bill does not provide that such orders will be subject to any form of parliamentary procedure, as the order will be an administrative order signed by the Secretary of State. Similarly, orders varying or revoking the original order will also be administrative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we vote on the clause it is only right to place on record the fact that, yet again, the Committee was grossly misled by the other Minister, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher). Even the words from his ministerial colleague just now have, I am sure, failed to convince my hon Friends that there is good will on the Government's part. We have been misled on this matter by an incompetent ministerial team.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
